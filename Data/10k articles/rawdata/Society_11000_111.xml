September 4, 1338 - d. November 2, 1391) was an [[imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled during the period 1372-1391. He was a [[Zaydi]] imam and a descendant of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].

== Biography ==

Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din was a son of [[al-Mahdi Ali|Ali al-Mahdi ibn Muhammad]], who was an imam of [[Yemen]] who ruled during the period 1349-1372.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman; Its Early Medieval History''. London 1892, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 14th century, several imams had disputed the succession. About the middle of the century, his father [[al-Mahdi Ali|Ali al-Mahdi ibn Muhammad]] attained considerable influence, which was however reduced before his death in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] in 1372. Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din became the sole Zaydi imam of Yemen. However, the important city [[San'a]] was in the hands of a Zaidi family that ruled as [[emir]]s. In the year after his accession, al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din attempted to seize San'a, but was unable to penetrate the strong defences. Instead, he resorted to strategy. He married the mother of the emir Idris bin Abdallah, but when Idris came to meet his new step-father, the latter arrested him and then marched into San'a in full force, in 1381. Idris and his mother were allowed to live in the city, but had no further contact with the imam.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din was a comparatively successful ruler; he advanced as far as the [[Tihama]] in the coastland of South [[Arabia]], moving against the [[Rasulids]]. In 1391 he was thrown off his mule and dragged along, receiving fatal injuries. When he died in San'a, his death was concealed for two months on account of insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 996.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the Salah al-Din Mosque, built on his initiative. He was the husband of as-Sayyidah Fatimah, daughter of the headman of the [[Kurds]] in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], who built the al-Abhar Mosque in San'a.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, 1983, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of al-Nasir was followed by internal turmoil among the Zaydi elite, but control over San'a was soon acquired by his young son [[al-Mansur Ali bin Salah ad-Din|al-Mansur Ali bin Salah al-Din]].

== His literary work ==

Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din wrote a commentary on [[al-Zamakhshari]]'s ''al-Kalim al-Nawabigh''. He titled his work ''al-Hikam al-Sawabigh fi al-Kalim al-Nawabigh''. In the same period of time, [[al-Taftazani]] (d. 1390) wrote also a commentary on al-Zamakhshari's work with slightly different title: ''al-Ni'am al-Sawabigh fi al-Kalim al-Nawabigh''.

'''Balarama Deva''' or '''Balaram Deo''' ([[Odia language|Odia]]: '''ବଳରାମ୍ ଦେବ୍''') was the first Chauhan ruler of [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]] line of Chauhan rulers and the tenth in line ruler of the Chauhan dynasty in the Western [[Odisha]] region during the sixteenth century. He was a powerful ruler and an excellent military strategist who ruled the hilly and forest tracts of western Odisha that was mostly inhabited by different tribal or aboriginal communities. After his ascension to the throne in the year 1575 A.D, he secured the region from the neighboring Ratanpur's [[Haihaiyavansi Kingdom|Haihayas]] and build a strong state surpassing the glory of his ancestral Chauhan state of Patna ([[Balangir district|Bolangir]]). Balarama Deva had also provided military assistance to the Gajapati king Ramachandra Deva of [[Khordha district|Khurda]] Kingdom and help to defend Khurda kingdom from the invading Muslim armies who either belonged to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Dynasty]] or the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda Sultanate]]. After consolidation of his authority over the regions of western Odisha and now parts of the state of [[Chhattisgarh|Chattishgarh]], Balarama Deva himself installed the idol of Goddess [[Samaleswari|Samleswari]] as the head family deity which began the era of cultural rejuvenation in the region.

== Initial Days in the Service of the Patna State  ==
After the death of the last hegemonic Gajapati Mukunda Deva in the Gohiratikri battlefield in 1568 AD, the Afghans and Mughals subsequently struggled for authority and an era of chaos had ensued.During the last quarter of the sixteenth century, Odisha was undergoing several political disturbances leading to the subsequent collapse of the central authority. The authority of the Gajapati kings of Odisha was starting to loose it's imperial status and the glorious title of 'Gajapati' had begun to get limited to the rulers of a very small region of today's [[Khordha|Khurda]], [[Puri]], [[Nayagarh district|Nayagarh]] and [[Cuttack district|Cuttack]] districts of coastal Odisha.Though Gajapati Kings lost their sovereignty,they remain the tutelary head and Odisha princely states and ancient Zamindaris establishes and flourished under Gajapati era.During the rule of Gajapati Ramachandra Deva of Khurda, the forces of the Afghans of Bengal invaded again and again while the Mughals closely contested them for control of the region through repeated clashes. As described in the [[Kosalananda Kavya]], Balarama Deva was sent with a force of 32,000 infantry, 700 cavalry and 30 war elephants to assist the Gajapati king by his father Hiradhara Deva.  Balarama Deva was instrumental in asserting the Independence of the Chauhan rule in the Patna state during this period. He also defeated the king of neighboring [[Bastar district|Bastar]] region who tried to take over the regions of western Odisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/129560/11/11_chapter%205.pdf|title=CHAUHAN RULERS O F SAMBALHJR.CC. 1575-1781 A.D.)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|page=76-87|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation and Integration of the new Sambalpur State ==

=== Folklore on Partition of the Chauhan Territory  ===

There are two different existing folklore which describes how Balarama Deva got to rule the northern part their ancestral kingdom around today's Sambalpur while his brother Narasimha Deva continued the rule from Patna. The first folklore speaks of Balarama Deva crossing the river Mayavati in the dark night to bring a nurse so that she could help his pregnant sister in law and the wife of Narasimha Deva who had gone to labor. His elder brother being very thankful gave him the northern part of his territory to rule. The second folklore narrates that there was an existing strife between the two brothers for accession to the throne when their mother intervened. She led both of them to a village called Kalapathar on the banks of river Ong and asked Narasimha to stand on the right bank of the river while Balarama was asked to stand on the left bank. She declared that the river would mark their boundary any attempt against it will be considered as a crime against her. In another case, the poem Jaya Chandrika written by Prahallad Dubey, the court poet of Sarangarh kingdom in the 18th Century, states that, Balarama Deva was fond of hunting and to fulfill his wishes he asked his mother for the region of Sambalpur which was situated on the bank of river Mahanadi and known for the diamond mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/18699/6/06_chapter%201.pdf|title=PATTERN OF STATE FORMATION: THE CASE OF SAMBALPUR|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|page=22-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partition Due to Kalachuri Haihaya Threat  ===

The neighboring Haihaya ruler Kalyan Sahai had declared himself as the overlord of forty eight princely states and forts which included large parts of western Odisha along with Patna. Due to the threat of conquest from the enemy and effective decentralized administration of the Chauhan kingdom, Balarama Deva was asked to practice his authority and guardianship separately in the northern areas by his ruling brother Narasimha Deva. The Haihaya threat never materialized once Balarama Deva effectively practiced his rule on the region. Eventually after the death of Narasimha Deva, the Patna state became unimportant due to the growing effectiveness of the newly founded Sambalpur state by Balarama Deva. The poem Jaya Chandrika describes the kingdom as Huma Desha where the river Jira flowed and the center of power was located at [[Bargarh district|Bargarh]]. Eventually to strengthen his defensive position, Balarama shifted his capital first to Chaunrpur and then to Sambalpur on the banks of river Mahanadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/18699/6/06_chapter%201.pdf|title=PATTERN OF STATE FORMATION: THE CASE OF SAMBALPUR|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|page=24-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military Conquests in the Region and Control Over Patna   ===

Balarama deva dealt first with the Ratanpur Haihaya threat by defeating the reigning king Lakshman Sahai after the death of Kalyan Sahai and conquered the neighboring regions of [[Raigarh]], [[Sakti, Chhattisgarh|Sakti]], [[Sarangarh]] and parts of Bargarh. The states of [[Surguja district|Surguja]] and [[Gangpur State|Gangpur]] became feudatory states of Sambalpur. The [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Ganga]] kingdom of [[Bamra State|Bamanda]] also became a vassal state after it was conquered and Rama Chandra Deva was appointed as feudal king under the authority of Sambalpur. During his conquests, the Gangpur ruler gave away his daughter Kamala Kumari in marriage to Balarama Deva and also he subsequently married another self ruling princess of Surguja when the kingdom was defeated by him. During Balarama Deva the new state was secured with eighteen forts also popularly known as Atharagarh and one of the main fort itself was the Bargarh fort which was initially built or restored by Balarama Deva as center of his power. There were also thirteen divisions in his new state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/18699/6/06_chapter%201.pdf|title=PATTERN OF STATE FORMATION: THE CASE OF SAMBALPUR|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|page=27-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/187678/7/07_chapter%202.pdf|title=The Chauhan Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|page=30-31, 36, 39|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his brother Narasimha Deva and again the death of the new successor Hamira Deva in a short span of three years, Balarama Deva sent his son Hridayanarayana Deva to rule the parent state of Patna. However, the widowed queen and the ministers complained against his rule. When the matters were investigated it was found that the corrupt ministers had created trouble in the practicing of effective authority by Hridayanarayana. Enraged by this event, Balarama expelled the ministers and the queen mother who later took shelter in the southern areas Nandpur.

== Cultural Contribution and Historical Impact ==
Balarama Deva had undertaken certain significant constructional and cultural restoration initiatives in his new kingdom. The foremost and the highly important step during his rule was to establish goddess Samleswari as the head deity of his state. Samleswari was adored by the local tribal population before in the region and their allegiance was won for himself due to this. It is also believed that the harvest festival of [[Nuakhai]] dedicated to goddess Samleswari, widely celebrated across western Odisha and neighboring regions was initiated by him. After defeating Surguja, he brought back an idol of [[Ananta Shayana|Ananta Saya]] as trophy for his victory and build a temple at Sambalpur for the deity. At the height of his power the newly founded kingdom at Sambalpur extended from the river [[Mahanadi]] in the north to the river [[Ong River|Ong]] in the south and from the Surangi in Phuljhar in the west to Huma on the Mahanadi in the east. He employed the Johoras for the collecting diamonds from the river bed of Mahanadi and granted them the villages of Hirakud and Junani. He granted lands to Brahmins and rebuilt or renovated the Huma temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazines.odisha.gov.in/Journal/Journal2/pdf/ohrj-011.pdf|title=ORAL TRADITION OF HUMA AND LEGITIMISATION OF CHAUHAN RULE|last=|first=|date=|website=www.magazines.odisha.gov.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temple for goddess Patneswari was built at Sambalpur during his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazines.odisha.gov.in/Orissareview/dec2004/englishPdf/tutelarygoddessofchauhandynasty.pdf|title=Tutelary Goddess of Chauhan Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website=www.magazines.odisha.gov.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the collapse of central authority and disintegration of Odisha in the sixteenth century caused by successive invasions and betrayal within the bureaucracy, Balarama Deva was able to secure and expand the parts of his kingdom. He ensured stability, security, law and order over his new kingdom by bringing together all his subjects. Balarama Deva is described in the poem Jaya Chandrika as the Garh Sambhari Chauhan King.

The '''Bali Aga''', '''Baliaga''' or '''Bali Mula''' are the indigenous people of [[Bali]], predominantly located in the eastern part of the island, in [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]]. They can also be found in north-western and central regions. Bali Aga people that are referred to as ''Bali Pergunungan'' (Mountain Balinese) are those that are located at [[Trunyan]] village. For the [[Trunyan]] Bali Aga people, the term ''Bali Aga'' (Mountain Balinese) is regarded as an insult with an additional meaning of "the mountain people that are fools"; therefore, they prefer the term ''Bali Mula'' (''lit'' Original Balinese) instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Danandjaja|title=Kebudayaan petani desa Trunyan di Bali: lukisan analitis yang menghubungkan praktek pengasuhan anak orang Trunyan dengan latar belakang etnografisnya|year=1989|publisher=Penerbit Universitas Indonesia|isbn=97-945-6034-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The original inhabitants of Bali are said to have come from Bedulu village long before the Hindu-Javanese immigration wave. The legend is, there lived the last king of the [[Pejeng]] (an old Balinese kingdom), [[Sri Aji Asura Bumibanten]], who had supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mischa Loose|title=Bali, Lombok|year=2012|publisher=DuMont Reiseverlag|isbn=37-701-6713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could cut off his head without feeling pain and put it back on again. One day, though, his head accidentally fell into a river and was swept away. One of his servants panicked and decided to quickly decapitate a pig and replace the king's head with the animal's head. Embarrassed, the king hid in a tall tower, denying any visitors. A small child discovered the secret and since then, the king became known as Dalem Bedulu, or ''He-who-changed-head''. Another explanation is that the name comes from the name ''Badahulu'' or "the village upstream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balivision.com/Article_Resources/bedulu.asp |title=Bedulu village |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108065915/http://www.balivision.com/Article_Resources/bedulu.asp |archivedate=2009-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Pejeng kingdom, the Majapahit Empire rose to power.

==Culture==
The Bali Aga live in isolated areas in the mountains. Their relative isolation compared to the lowland Balinese had preserved some of the original Austronesian element, apparent in the [[Bali Aga architecture]]. Tourists wishing to visit certain villages must be careful due to the geography of the area. While visiting, it is also important to be respectful and quietly observe the preserved way of life the Bali Aga have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2015/01/03/190800627/Menjaga.Geopark.Kaldera.Danau.Batur |author=Sigit Wahyu |editor=Ni Luh Made Pertiwi F |title=Menjaga "Geopark" Kaldera Danau Batur |publisher=Kompas |date=3 January 2015 |accessdate=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tenganan]], where tourism is more easily embraced and the people are said to be more friendly, a three-day festival called ''[[Udaba Sambah]]'' is held during the months of June or July. It is also to be noted that Tenganan prohibits divorce and polygamy, unlike other villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2016/11/10/different-cultural-insights-in-balis-tenganan-village.html |author= |title=Different cultural insights in Bali's Tenganan village |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=10 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Bali Aga speak their own dialect of the [[Balinese language]]. It dates back thousands of years and varies from village to village; the version spoken in the [[Tenganan]] village is different from the [[Trunyan]] village.

==Craftwork==
An important part of Bali Aga culture is the complex [[tie-dye]] technique used to make Bali's traditional ''[[geringsing]]'' double [[ikat]]. Bali's Tenganan village is the only village that today still produces ''geringsing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ryan Ver Berkmoes, Adam Skolnick &amp; Marian Carroll|title=Bali &amp; Lombok|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=174-2203-13-2|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''geringsing'', both the cotton warp and weft threads are carefully dyed and cross-dyed before weaving; the finished pattern only emerges as the cloth is woven. According to textile expert John Guy, "the ancestry of Balinese ''geringsing'' is far from clear, although some cloths display the unmistakable influence of [[Patola cloth|''patola'']]",&lt;ref&gt;Guy, John, ''Indian Textiles in the East'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2009, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; the silk double ikats produced in Gujarat during the height of the Spice Trade (16-17C). Many of these imported cloths became inspiration for later locally-made textiles, but one theory is that the Balinese-made cloths were exported to India and copied there for production to Asian markets. Many have unique Hindu motifs such as a bird's eye view of a mandala with a sacred center from which everything radiates. Others feature designs clearly inspired by ''patola'', for example a design known as the [[Plumeria|frangipani flower]] (''jepun'').&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The palette of ''geringsing'' is typically red, neutral, and black. ''Geringsing'' are regarded as sacred cloths, "ascribed supernatural properties, especially to assist in forms of healing, including exorcism."&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gering'' means decease and ''sing'' means no.

The '''Bamum''', sometimes called '''Bamoum''', '''Bamun''', '''Bamoun''', or '''Mum''', are a [[Bantoid]] [[ethnic group]] of [[Cameroon]] with around 215,000 members.

==Religion==
The Bamum traditional religion placed great emphasis on ancestral spirits which were embodied in the skulls of the deceased ancestors. The eldest males of each lineage had possession of the skulls of deceased males. When moving a diviner must find an appropriate place to hold the skull. Despite these efforts some men's skulls remained unclaimed and their spirits are deemed restless. Ceremonies are thus done to placate these spirits. There is also respect for female skulls, but the details are less documented.

[[Image:Njoya of Bamun.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]].]]
They also believed women made the soil fruitful, thus women did the planting and harvesting. Masks and representations of the head also had importance. In modern times, many Bamum are [[Islam|Muslim]] or [[Christianity|Christian]]. King [[Ibrahim Njoya]] himself converted to [[Islam]] then to [[Christianity]] and then back to [[Islam]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. He is said to have disliked abstaining from [[polygamy]] when Christian, and from [[alcohol]] when Muslim, so ultimately split the difference toward the end.

==Writing system==
{{main|Bamum language|Bamum script}}
[[Bamum language]] (''Shüpamom,'' pronounced {{IPA-xx|ʃypaˑmɔm|}}, "language Bamum"; in the French tradition spelled ''Bamoun'') is one of the [[Benue–Congo languages]] of [[Cameroon]], with approximately 215,000 speakers. The language is particularly well known for [[Bamum script|its original phonetic script]], developed by Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya|Njoya]] and his palace circle around 1895. The development of the script spanned ideographic to syllabic systems, with the script's final and most prominent form known as "A-ka-u-ku." This is not to be confused with another of Njoya's inventions, an artificial spoken language known as [[Shümom language|Shümom]], which was devised after the script. Outsider observers in recent years have tended to confuse the script with the invented language. The French colonials destroyed Njoya's schools and forbade the teaching of the script, which fell into rapid decline and today hovers on the brink of extinction (the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]], in [[Foumban]], is teaching the script to young people to spread literacy), but the Shümom language is spoken as a second language by many people and is taught on the radio throughout the Bamum kingdom. Cameroonian musicians [[Claude Ndam]] and Gerryland are native speakers of Bamum and use it in their music.

==Nguon==

Nguon is a significant holiday for the Bamoun people.  Recently, Ngoun has taken place every two years in late November-early December.

[[File:Estadio Nueva Chicago.jpg|thumb|Members of ''barras bravas'' are often found scattered between the flags that display. In the picture, ''barra brava'' of [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago]], from Argentina.]]

'''''Barra brava''''' is a name for organized groups of supporters of [[association football|football]] teams in Latin America. Their behavior is similar to European [[ultras]] and hooligan groups. It includes standing throughout the match, singing, and other enthusiastic behavior such as waving flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27668750|title=La Barra Brava: Why US football fans chant in Spanish – BBC News|website=BBC News|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon originated in Argentina in the 1950s and spread throughout the Americas. Similar groups in  Mexico are called ''porras'' and [[Torcida organizada|''torcidas organizadas'']] in Brazil. Barras bravas are common in Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Colombia and have spread to other parts of the world, including the United States.

== History ==
Groups of Argentine fans that stood out for their fervour from the rest of supporters spontaneously began to appear during the 1920s. These groups were labeled ''Barras'' by the media; a term that is equivalent to the term [[gang]] in Argentina and Uruguay, but that in its original meaning, was used to describe an informal group of people without any relation to crime who meet regularly. One of those groups named ''La barra de la Goma'' ("The ''barra'' of the rubber"), was created in 1927. They supported the [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] football club. The name comes from the rubber of bike inner tubes (filled with sand, and tied with wire at the ends) to attack rival fans. They would throw objects to their team's goalkeeper to bother him when he should intervene in the game.{{Clarify|reason=They wanted to distract the home team?|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Fotodela22.jpg|thumb|The barras are recognizable for their flags. No other sector of the stadium has more quantity or density of such. In the picture, ''La Banda del Loco Fierro'', organised supporter group of [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]].]]
The actions of this group were limited to stadiums, during home matches, and they did not follow the team to other cities. They did not intend to provoke violence, as it arose spontaneously usually during games that were difficult for their team, as a way to influence the score through intimidation of rival players and referees with insults and blunt objects. Occasionally they entered the pitch (playing field) and assaulted opposing players. They intimidated rival fans who tried to bother players on their team. At the end of the same decade, a few newspapers described this group as "brave" (Spanish for fierce).

The ''Barras'' became a traditional part of the Argentine football crowds and evolved until, in the mid-1950s, they started to receive financing from the football clubs to attend away matches. Their goals expanded to include provoking violence against rival players and fans, repelling police and defending against attacks  by rival supporters. They thus became the first organised, violent, football support groups.

Argentine journalist Amílcar Romero stated that, before the appearance of such groups, when a team played away, they were intimidated by rival fans. ''Barras bravas'' were a response to this pressure. Each club had its own ''barra brava'', financed by the club. These groups were given tickets and paid travel to the stadiums. Access to these benefits was controlled by the group's leadership. To obtain prestige, the member had to be violent.

{{Quote|In Argentine football it was institutionalised that, if you played away, you were pressured inexorably. Although it was not about ''barras bravas'' as we know them today. Home fans pressured you and, police, if was not watching to another place, also pressured you. That had to be compensated with a theory that in the next decade (the 1950s) was rife: to every operating group with a Mystical Ability to produce violence, the only way to counter it is with another minority group, with as much or more mystique to produce violence.|Amílcar Romero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-22673-2003-07-13.html|title=Las barras aparecen con la industrialización del fútbol|trans-title=''Barras'' appears with industrialization of football|publisher=[[Página/12]]|date=July 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1958, media and society noted existence of this groups after riots during a match between [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] (at [[Estadio José Amalfitani|José Amalfitani]] stadium) at which 19-year-old Alberto Mario Linker, was killed by police (he was hit in the chest by a tear gas grenade) when cops tried to disperse River Plate fans who were causing unrest. Newspaper [[La Razón (Buenos Aires)|La Razón]] denominated River Plate's organised supporter group as a ''Barra Fuerte'' (strong gang), differentiating them for the first time from the traditional ''barras''.

''Barra brava'' appeared in Argentine media, in the 1960s, but became a popular term in the 1980s.

Argentina has the most dangerous organized fan groups in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html|title=Los hooligans más peligrosos del mundo están en Argentina|last=Magallón|first=Enrique López|date=10 October 2007|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|trans-title=The most dangerous hooligans in the world are in Argentina|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barra-brava.com/index.php/barra-brava/about-us|title=About Us|last=User|first=Super|website=www.barra-brava.com|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 all visiting fans were banned from matches.&lt;ref name="bbc20130612"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22864505 |title=Argentina bans football away fans |date=2013-06-12 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-11-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through August 2012 Argentine football has experienced 301 hooligan related deaths.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Several such deaths and shootings were the result of rival factions within the same clubs.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Characteristics ==
These groups display and wave flags (that in Argentine football slang are called ''trapos'' -cloths-) and umbrellas (with team's colours), and use musical instruments such as bass drums and, since the mid-2000s, trumpets) to accompany their [[football chant|chants]]. They occupy terraces where viewers must stand. In [[all-seater stadium]]s (rare in Argentina and many other Latin American countries), ''barras bravas'' stand throughout the match.
[[File:Hinchada Newell's Old Boys.jpg|thumb|Supporters of [[Newell's Old Boys]] (club from [[Rosario]], Argentina) standing upon a metal [[crush barrier]].]]
The most characteristic flags are shaped like giant strips several meters in length (called ''trapos largos'' -long flags- or ''tirantes'' -suspenders-), that are deployed from the top of the terrace to the bottom. ''Barras bravas'' usually also have a flag with the name of the group.

Traditionally, many members stand upon the crush barriers (''paravalanchas'' -avalanche-stoppers- in Argentine slang) that are placed in terraces to prevent [[human crush|crushing]]. They hold a "suspender" with one or both hands (this was the purpose to make this flags shaped like strips), or to the body of someone else who is fastened to the flag, or even some supporter who is standing below (on a step).

They start and coordinate every chant and wave the most important and big flags. ''Barras Bravas'' always are located in the center of the terrace that occupy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/21/argentina-football-gangs-barra-bravas|title=The barra bravas: the violent Argentinian gangs controlling football|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=20 August 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=17 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the group enters the terrace before the match, the center is traditionally left empty by the other fans (even if the terrace it is almost full), showing respect to the ''barra brava''.

Originally these groups were not numerous, violent, or powerful. Over the years, this changed. In some cases the ''barra brava'' decided who would be the club's chairman. Since the 1980s and 1990s, hooliganism has grown and some groups engaged in illegal activities such as extorting money from club leadership, players, and hawkers that work at the stadium. They also may participate in drug sales and thefts. They often provide services to political and union leaders who hire them as agitator groups (during rallies and mass meetings, that in Argentina traditionally have people chanting like football crowds, playing drums and even shooting firecrackers), [[goon squad]]s (clashing with supporters of other political parties, unions or police during demonstrations, protests, rallies and strikes), bodyguards, etc.

They are funded by club leadership, which may give salaries to some members or even a percentage of the profits. Usually they are responsible for stadium security during non-football events.

[[File:Buenos Aires - Estadio José Amalfitani (Vélez Sársfield).jpg|thumb|center|''La Pandilla'', Vélez Sarsfield's ''barra brava'', located in the center of the main terrace of José Amalfitani stadium (from [[Buenos Aires]]) with its "suspenders".]]
In Argentina, in the 2000s they faced violent disputes among some of members for control of the group. A large percentage of deaths related to football since that time were related to internal disputes within ''barras bravas''. Some sell tickets on the black market for profit; a head of the River Plate barra had money equivalent to over 200,000 British pounds confiscated by the police in November 2018, leading perhaps to anti-Boca Juniors violence a day later.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46341666&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the ''barras brava'' is generally related to the level of the club's popularity. However, some clubs have big supporter groups even they are not generally popular. This usually occurs when the club has, at least, a relatively high popularity in a neighborhood. Group sizes range from a few dozen to more than 1,000.

[[Image:Berber flag.svg|thumb|350px|Berber flag - Ratio 2:3]]
The '''Berber flag''' ({{Lang-ber|ⴰⵛⵏⵢⴰⵍ ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ, Acenyal Amaziɣ}}) is a [[flag]] that has been adopted for the [[Berbers]]. It is currently used by Berber activists in 10{{which|date=December 2017}} [[Africa|African]] countries. 

The flag was inaugurated in [[Ouadhia]], a town of [[Kabylia]] situated in [[Tizi Ouzou]], a wilaya of [[Algeria]], by an elder Algerian Kabylian ''[[Algerian_War|veteran]]'' named '''[[Mohammed Arav Bessaoud|Mohand Arav Bessaoud]]'''. He was considered a spiritual father of [[Berberism]] and was also a writer and an activist of the [[Algerian Revolution]].

==History==
In the 1970s the [[Berber Academy]] (''Agraw Imazighen'') proposed the first Berber flag. In 1998 the [[World Amazigh Congress]] made the flag official at Tafira on [[Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]], which were formerly inhabited by the [[Guanches]], an ancient Berber people.

The flag is composed of blue, green, and yellow horizontal bands of the same height, and a [[Tifinagh]] letter ''yaz'' or ''aza''.

==Description==
Each colour corresponds to an aspect of [[Tamazgha]], the territory inhabited by Berbers in [[North Africa]]:
* [[blue]] represents the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]];
* [[green]] represents [[nature]] and the green [[mountain]]s;
* [[yellow]] represents the sands of the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]].

The ''yaz'' ([[ⵣ]]) symbolizes the "[[Berbers|free man]]", which is the meaning of the [[Berber languages|Berber]] word ''amazigh'', the Berbers' own name for themselves ([[endonym]]). It is in [[red]], the colour of [[life]], and also the colour of [[resistance movement|resistance]].

The Berber flag thus symbolizes the entire Amazigh people, living in harmony with their land, '''Tamazgha'''.

{{History of Uruguay}}
The '''Charrúa''' are an Amerindian, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous People]] or Indigenous Nation of the [[Southern Cone]] in present-day [[Uruguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raicesuruguay.com/raices/sangre_indigena.html |title=Aboriginal blood in Uruguay |author=[[Renzo Pi Hugarte]] |publisher=Raíces Uruguay |accessdate=2 February 2015 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjacent areas in [[Argentina]] ([[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]) and [[Brazil]] ([[Rio Grande do Sul]]).{{sfn|Burford|2011|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2011/03/28/uruguay-and-the-memory-of-the-charrua/|title=Uruguay and the memory of the Charrúa tribe|website=The Prisma|date=28 March 2011|first=Wilfredo|last=Alayón|accessdate=20 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were a semi-nomadic people who sustained themselves mainly through hunting and gathering. Since resources were not permanent in every region, they would constantly be on the move.&lt;ref&gt;Acosta y Lara, Eduardo, F. ''El Pais Charrua''. Fundacion BankBoston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Rain, drought, and other environmental factors determined their movement. For this reason they are often called "nomadas estacionales"; which means seasonal nomads.&lt;ref&gt;Acosta y Lara, Eduardo, F. ''El Pais Charrua''. Fundacion BankBoston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Debret2.jpg|thumb|left|A Charrúa warrior.]]
[[File:Charrua.JPG|thumbnail|left|Charrua territories]]

The life of the Charrúas before contact with the Spanish Colonists remains to a large extent a mystery. It is for this reason that most knowledge about the Charrúas comes from Spanish contact with them.
Chroniclers such as the Jesuit Pedro Lozano accused the Charrúan people of killing the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] during his 1515 voyage up the [[Río de la Plata]]. This was a crucial moment since it shows that the Charrúas were going to resist the Spanish Invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Historia de la conquista del Paraguay, Rio de la Plata y Tucuman, Volumen 1, pág. 27. Autor: Pedro Lozano, 1755. Editor: Andrés Lamas. Casa Editora "Imprenta Popular", 1874&lt;/ref&gt; Following the arrival of European settlers, the Charrúa, along with the Chana, strongly resisted their territorial invasion. In the 18th and 19th centuries the Charrúa were confronted by cattle exploitation that strongly altered their way of life, causing famine and forcing them to rely on cows and sheep. However, these were in that epoch increasingly privatized {{Explain|date=August 2018}}. Malones (raids) were resisted by settlers who freely shot any indigenous people who were in their way.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Physical description==
This is a descriptive statement by Jose Imbelloni "The skull is bulky and often presents a high bone thickness and significant weight, especially in the macrosomatic groups preserved in the south, the cheekbones are powerful and the chin is thick and protruding, the face is elongated and the nasal index leptorrino (narrow nose and long.) The construction of the skeleton is massive, at times enormous. Aside to this somewhat coarse macrosomatic canon, we must take into account the reciprocal proportions of the members, which point to a remarkable harmony. The athletic cut and balance of the muscular masses make the pámpido one of the most superb models of the human organism. With regard to physiognomy, there is almost no sexual dimorphism, and men are very little different from women. Current color of intense pigmentation, with bronzed reflections. Dark, hard and smooth hair." &lt;ref&gt;IMBELLONI, José, "De Historia Primitiva de América. Los grupos raciales aborígenes". Madrid, Cuadernos de Historia Primitiva Año II, N° 2. 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genocide==

The drastic demographic reduction of the Charrúa did not occur until the first president of Uruguay [[Fructuoso Rivera]]. Although Rivera initially maintained good relations with the Charrúa, the increasing dominance of the whites and desires of expansion led to hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Alayón, Wilfredo (28 March 2011). "Uruguay and the memory of the Charrúa tribe". The Prisma. Retrieved 20 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore organized a genocide campaign known as ''La Campaña de Salsipuedes'' in 1831. This campaign was composed of three different attacks in three different places: "El Paso del Sauce del Queguay", "El Salsipuedes", and a passage known as "La cueva del Tigre".&lt;ref&gt;Acosta y Lara, Eduardo, F. ''El Pais Charrua''. Fundacion BankBoston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that the first attack was a betrayal. The president Fructuoso Rivera knew the tribe leaders, and called them to his Barracks by the river later named Salsipuedes. He claimed that he needed their help to defend territory and that they should join together, however, once the Charrúas were drunk and off their guard, the Uruguayan soldiers attacked them. The following two attacks were carried out to eliminate the Charrúas that had escaped or had not been present.
It is said that since 11 April 1831, when the Salsipuedes (meaning "Get-out-if-you-can") campaign was launched by a group led by [[Bernabé Rivera]], nephew of Fructuoso Rivera, the Charrúa were then officially claimed to be extinct.

Four surviving Charrúa were captured at Salsipuedes. The directory of the Oriental School of Montevideo thought a nearly extinct race would spark the interest of French scientists and public.&lt;ref&gt;Darío Arce. «Nuevos datos sobre el destino de Tacuavé y la hija de Guyunusa». Consultado el 1 de julio de 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were Senacua Sénaqué, a [[medicine man]]; Vaimaca-Pirú Sira, a [[warrior]]; and a young couple, [[Laureano Tacuavé Martínez]] and [[María Micaëla Guyunusa]]. All four were taken to [[Paris]], [[France]], in 1833, where they were exhibited to the public. The display was not a success and they all soon died in France, including a baby daughter born to Sira and Guyunusa, and adopted by Tacuavé.{{sfn|Burford|2011|p=16}} The child was named María Mónica Micaëla Igualdad Libertad by the Charrúa, yet she was filed by the French as Caroliné Tacouavé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chancharrua.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/el-parto-de-maria-micaela-guyunusa/|title=El Parto de María Micaëla Guyunusa|author=Charrua Hapkido y Tkd Paysandu|website=chancharrua.wordpress.com|publisher=Charrúas del Uruguay, La nación Charrúa|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Parto de María Micaëla Guyunusa|url=http://indiauy.tripod.com/ceci/ceci_a15-04.htm|website=indiauy.tripod.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monumental sculpture, ''Los Últimos Charrúas'' was built in their memory in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.{{sfn|Burford|2011|p=119}}

Since the 1980s - after Uruguay's last dictatorship - a group of people have been affirming and vindicating their Charruan ancestry. In 1989, they gathered around Adench (Asociación de los descendientes de la Nación Charrúa), by then they self-recognized themselves as "descendants". In 2005, another organization was formed - CONACHA (Consejo de la Nación Charrúa) - where families came out of clandestinity and self-recognized themselves publicly as Charrúa.

==Legacy==
[[File:Dibuxu de Vaimaca escontra 1833.jpg|thumb|left|The last Charrúa people in 1833.]]
Not much is known about the Charrúa due to their cognitive erasure at an early time in Uruguayan history. The only surviving documents that concern the Charrúa are those of Spanish explorers, archaeologists and anthropologists. A new literature is currently emerging about their family oral history, ethnogenesis and activism.

It is thought that there are approximately between 160 thousand and 300 thousand individuals in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil today, that are descendants from surviving Charrúa.&lt;ref&gt;Alayón, Wilfredo (28 March 2011). "Uruguay and the memory of the Charrúa tribe". The Prisma. Retrieved 20 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguayans refer to themselves as "charrúa" when in the context of a competition or battle against a foreign contingent. In situations in which Uruguayans display bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, the expression "garra charrúa" (''Charrúan tenacity'') is used to refer to victory in the face of certain defeat.

After Salsipuedes, the Charrúa were gradually dispossessed of their sovereignty while the new State was affirming its jurisdiction over the whole territory. According to the Argentine census of 2001, there are 676 Charrúa living in the province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]].

There is a Charrúa cemetery located in [[Piriápolis]] in the [[Maldonado Department]].{{sfn|Burford|2011|p=173}}

The [[Uruguay national football team]] is nicknamed "Los Charrúas" and a local rugby side in [[Porto Alegre]] are also named after the nation (see: [[Charrua Rugby Clube]])

Charrua is also a name of a Brazilian military tank for troops transportation.

In 1888 was published ''[[Tabaré (poem)|Tabaré]]'', an epic poem by [[Juan Zorrilla de San Martín]] about a Charrúa and his love for a Spanish woman.

The [[rivuline]] ''[[Austrolebias charrua]]'' was named after them.

A street of Montevideo in the neighbourhoods of [[Pocitos]] and [[Cordón]] is named Charrúa.

In August 1989 the Association of the Descendants of the Charrúa Nation was created to rescue, conserve, and promulgate the knowledge and presence of indigenous peoples in Uruguay.

[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|[[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of the Church of Scientology]]
The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in [[Camden, New Jersey]]&lt;ref name="Blue Sky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulpateer"/&gt; by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], his wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], and John Galusha. By that time, the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] (HASI) had already been operating since 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lronhubbard.org/profile/chron7.htm |title=Scientology Chronicle 1952-1955 |publisher=Lronhubbard.org |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889564,00.html?internalid=ACA ''Remember Venus?''], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], December 22, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and Hubbard himself had already been selling Scientology books and technologies. In 1953 he wrote to Helen O'Brien, who was managing the organization, asking her to investigate the "religion angle".&lt;ref name="Miller87"&gt;Miller, Russell.

Ron (1954) Why Doctor of Divinity? ''Professional Auditor's Bulletin'' no. 32, August 7, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; stressing its relation to the concept of [[Dharma]].

Hubbard stated, "A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/wis/wiseng/eos/eos_1.htm |title="Aims of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard" at official site |publisher=Scientology.org |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of the Church of Scientology, Hubbard composed its creed. The Scientology creed emphasizes three key points: being free to enjoy religious expression, the idea that mental healing is inherently religious, and that healing of the physical body is in the spiritual domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |accessdate=2016-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard had official control of the organization until 1966 when this function was transferred to a group of executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Meddling with Minds | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838617,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1968-08-23 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hubbard maintained no formal relationship with Scientology's management, he remained firmly in control of the organization and its affiliated organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = John |last = Marshall |title = Hubbard still gave orders, records show |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date = 1980-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1986, subsequent to the sudden death of L. Ron Hubbard, [[David Miscavige]], who was at that time the Commanding Officer of the Commodore's Messenger Organisation, assumed the position of Chairman of the Board of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), a non-profit corporation that administers the trademarked names and symbols of Dianetics and Scientology. Although RTC is a separate corporation from the [[Church of Scientology International]], whose president and chief spokesperson is [[Heber Jentzsch]], Miscavige is the effective leader of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

It was followed by the launch of "The Golden Age of Knowledge" in 2005, where Hubbard's announcements of milestones in the research and development of Dianetics and Scientology were released. Between 2005 and 2010, the church would complete its 25-year program to restore and verify the church's "scriptures". The church released the second phase of the Golden Age of Tech on November 2013, based on the original work of Hubbard. The [[Flag Building|Super Power Rundown]] a new component of auditing, was released in Clearwater, Florida.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |title=Cult Wars in Historical Perspective: New and Minority Religions |chapter=Scientology |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |publisher=Routledge |date=21 July 2016 |isbn=978-1472458124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Scientology|Scientology beliefs and practices}}
The Church of Scientology promotes Scientology, a body of beliefs and related practices created by Hubbard, starting in 1952 as a successor to his earlier [[self-help]] system, [[Dianetics]].&lt;ref name="TimeVenus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Remember Venus?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889564,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=1952-12-22|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology teaches that people are immortal spiritual beings who have forgotten their true nature. Scientology's central mythology developed around the original notion of the thetan. In Scientology, the thetan is the individual expression of "theta", described by Neusner as "the cosmic source and life force". The thetan is the true human identity, rendering humans as "pure spirit and godlike". The religion's mythology holds the belief that "in the primordial past, thetans applied their creative abilities to form the physical universe". Contrary to the biblical narrative that shows that the universe was created by a divine, sole creator, Scientology holds that "the universe was created by theta in the form of individualized expressions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0664233204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of [[Xenu]] is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in Earthly events, collectively described as [[space opera]] by Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Neusner227"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Neusner|2003|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as "[[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]", in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience painful or traumatic events in their past, in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.&lt;ref name="Melton28"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Melton|2000|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study materials and auditing courses are made available to members in return for specified donations.&lt;ref name="Melton59-60"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Melton|2000|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology is legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in the United States&lt;ref name="Finkelman287"&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Scientology+has+achieved+full+legal+recognition+as+a+religious+denomination+in+the+United+States%22|isbn=978-0-415-94342-0}} "Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries,&lt;ref name=DHDavis&gt;{{cite conference|first=Derek H. |last=Davis |title=The Church of Scientology: In Pursuit of Legal Recognition |booktitle=Zeitdiagnosen: Religion and Conformity |publisher=Lit Verlag |year=2004 |location=Münster, Germany |url=http://www.umhb.edu/files/academics/crl/publications/articles/the_church_of_scientologypursuit_of_legal_recognition.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-10 |format=PDF |quote=Many countries, including the United States, now give '''official recognition''' to Scientology as a religion [...] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o4YGXMBa?url=http://www.umhb.edu/files/academics/crl/publications/articles/the_church_of_scientologypursuit_of_legal_recognition.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lucytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abroad: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology|author=Lucy Morgan|date=March 29, 1999|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|quote=In the United States, Scientology gained '''status as a tax-exempt religion''' in 1993 when the Internal Revenue Service agreed to end a long legal battle over the group's right to the exemption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey"&gt;Toomey, Shamus (June 26, 2005).

Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. According to the ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', it is "concerned with the isolation, description, handling and rehabilitation of the human spirit".&lt;ref&gt;"Other Psychic New Age Groups."

One of the major tenets of Scientology is that a human is an immortal alien spiritual being, termed a [[thetan]], that is presently trapped on planet Earth in a physical "meat body." Hubbard described these thetans in "[[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|The Space Opera]]" cosmogony. The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is accepted in Scientology that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Descriptions of space opera incidents are seen as true events by Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.scientology.org/p_jpg/gloss.htm|title = The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Church of Scientology International|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071221000232/http://www.scientology.org/p_jpg/gloss.htm|archivedate=2007-12-21 |quote = space opera: of or relating to time periods on the whole track millions of years ago which concerned activities in this and other galaxies.

Scientology claims that its practices provide methods by which a person can achieve greater spiritual awareness.&lt;ref name="dogma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/index.html | title = Scientology.org - Introduction to Scientology | publisher = Church of Scientology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Scientology, progression from level to level is often called [[The Bridge to Total Freedom]]. Scientologists progress from "Preclear", to "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]", and ultimately "[[Operating Thetan]]".

Scientologists are taught that a series of events, or [[Incident (Scientology)|incidents]], occurred before life on earth.&lt;ref name="En.allexperts.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Scientology-1751/L-Ron-Hubbard-space.htm?zIr=1 |title=Scientology: L.

Hubbard's image and writing are ubiquitous in Scientology churches. Churches built after Hubbard's death include a corporate-style office set aside for Hubbard's reincarnation, with a plaque on the desk bearing his name, and a pad of paper with a pen for him to continue writing novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyd|first1=Joe|title=A Mind-bending experience|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence.

Scientology organizations and missions exist in many communities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smi.org |title=Scientology Missions International Homepage |publisher=Smi.org |date=2010-11-28 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists call their larger centers ''orgs'', short for "organizations." The major Scientology organization of a region is known as a central org. The legal address of the Church of Scientology International is in Los Angeles, [[California]], 6331 Hollywood Blvd, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building. The Church of Scientology also has several major headquarters, including:

=== Saint Hill, West Sussex, England ===
{{Main|Saint Hill Manor}}
Hubbard moved to England shortly after founding Scientology, where he oversaw its worldwide development from an office in London for most of the 1950s. In 1959, he bought [[Saint Hill Manor]], a Georgian manor house near the [[Sussex]] town of [[East Grinstead]]. During Hubbard's years at Saint Hill, he traveled extensively, providing lectures and training in Australia, South Africa in the United States, and developing materials that would eventually become Scientology's "core systematic theology and praxis".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Saint Hill and the Development of Systematic Theology in the Church of Scientology (1959-1967) |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |year=2015 |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=111–155 |issn=1946-0538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Saint Hill, Hubbard worked with a staff of nineteen and urged others to join. In September 14, 1959, he wrote: "Here, on half a hundred acres of lovely grounds in a mansion where we have not yet found all the bedrooms, we are handling the problems of administration and service for the world of Scientology. We are not very many here and as the sun never sets on Scientology we are very busy thetans."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The most important achievement of the Saint Hill period was Hubbard's execution of the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course (SHBC). It was delivered by Hubbard from March 1951 to December 1966 and "is considered the single most comprehensive and rigorous training course for budding auditors in the church". Scientology groups called "Saint Hill Organizations" located in Los Angeles, Clearwater (Florida), Copenhagen and Sydney still teach this course.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

This became the worldwide headquarters of Scientology through the 1960s and 1970s. Hubbard declared Saint Hill to be the organization by which all other organizations would be measured, and he issued a general order (still followed today) for all organizations around the world to expand and reach "Saint Hill size". The Church of Scientology has announced that the next two levels of [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology teaching]], ''OT 9'' and ''OT 10'', will be released and made available to church members when all the major organizations in the world have reached Saint Hill size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtW90YkkB3gC&amp;pg=PA425&amp;lpg=PA425&amp;dq=scientology+ot+9+and+10+saint+hill+size&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=01Zyd7iGXm&amp;sig=_MfFyxHzlZCufpMeKfhdpxXBZ04&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKn_aj55TOAhWl6oMKHd_-BNo4ChDoAQg9MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20ot%209%20and%2010%20saint%20hill%20size&amp;f=false |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |page=411 |accessdate=2016-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Walking in Ron's Footsteps: "Pilgrimage" Sites of the Church of Scientology |journal=Numen |date=2016 |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=71–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flag Land Base, Clearwater, Florida, United States===
{{Main|Fort Harrison Hotel}}

The "worldwide spiritual headquarters" of the Church of Scientology is known as "Flag Land Base," located in [[Clearwater, Florida]]. It is operated by the [[Florida|Floridian]] [[corporation]] [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]].

The organization was founded in 1975 when a Scientology-founded group called "Southern Land Development and Leasing Corp" purchased the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] for $2.3 million. Because the reported tenant was the "United Churches of Florida" the citizens and City Council of Clearwater did not realize that the building's owners were actually the Church of Scientology until after the building's purchase.  Clearwater citizens' groups, headed by Mayor [[Gabriel Cazares]], rallied strongly against Scientology establishing a base in the city (repeatedly referring to the organization as a cult), but Flag Base was established nonetheless.&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles L.

In the years since its foundation, the Flag Land Base has expanded as the Church of Scientology has gradually purchased large amounts of additional property in the downtown and waterfront Clearwater area. Scientology's largest project in Clearwater has been the construction of a high-rise complex called the "[[Super Power Building]]", or Flag Building, which "is the centerpiece of a 160-million construction campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Farley | title = Scientology's town Series: Scientology's town: A two-part special report |edition= South Pinellas | date = 2004-07-18 | work = St. Petersburg Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology's CST Chairman of the Board, David Miscavige, led the opening and dedication of the 377,000-square-foot Flag Building on November 17, 2013. The multi-million cathedral is the new spiritual headquarters of Scientology. The fifth and sixth floor contain the "Super Power Program", which includes specially designed machines that Scientologists believe allow users to develop new abilities and experience enlightenment. The building also includes a dining facility, course rooms, offices and small rooms for "auditing" purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/11/church-of-scientology-dedicates-145-million-super-power-building/ | title = Church of Scientology Dedicates $145 Million 'Super Power' Building | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruise-attends-unveiling-scientology-657211 | title = Tom Cruise Attends Unveiling of Scientology 'Super Power' Building | accessdate = 2013-11-19 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/celebrities-hand-open-scientology-cathedral-5716402 | title = Celebrities on hand to open Scientology 'cathedral' | accessdate = 2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizations in Hollywood, California ===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
[[Los Angeles, California]], has the largest concentration of Scientologists and Scientology-related organizations in the world, with the church's most visible presence being in the Hollywood district of the city. The organization owns a former hospital on [[Fountain Avenue]] which houses Scientology's [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] headquarters, the Pacific Area Command Base &amp;mdash; often referred to as "PAC Base" or "Big Blue", after its blue paint job. Adjacent buildings include headquarters of several internal Scientology divisions, including the American Saint Hill Organization, the Advanced Organization of Los Angeles, and the Church of Scientology of Los Angeles. All these organizations are integrated within the corporation [[Church of Scientology Western United States]].

The Church of Scientology successfully campaigned to have the city of Los Angeles rename one block of a street running through this complex "L. Ron Hubbard Way". The street has been paved in brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grad|first1=Shelby|title=How Scientology got L.A. to name street after L.

Scientology's [[Celebrity Centres|Celebrity Center International]] is located on [[Franklin Avenue (Los Angeles)|Franklin Avenue]], while the [[Association for Better Living and Education]], [[Author Services]] and the official headquarters of the [[Church of Scientology International]] (in the [[Guaranty Building (Hollywood, California)|Hollywood Guaranty Building)]] are all located on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The ground floor of the Guaranty Building also features the ''L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition'', a museum detailing his life that is open to the general public. The Celebrity Centre was acquired by the church as the Chateau Elysee in 1973, built to accommodate members in the arts, sports and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scientologys-hollywood-real-estate-empire-213141|title=Scientology's Hollywood Real Estate Empire|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trementina Base ===
{{Main|Trementina Base}}

The Church of Scientology maintains a large base on the outskirts of [[Trementina, New Mexico]], for the purpose of storing their archiving project: engraving Hubbard's writings on stainless steel tablets and encasing them in titanium capsules underground.  An aerial photograph showing the base's enormous [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] symbols on the ground caused media interest and a local TV station broke the story in November 2005. According to a report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the organization unsuccessfully attempted to coerce the station not to air the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065_pf.html |title='&amp;#39;A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles,'&amp;#39; By Richard Leiby Washington Post Staff Writer Date: Sunday, November 27, 2005 |work=The Washington Post |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freewinds ===
{{Main|Freewinds}}
The [[cruise ship]] ''Freewinds'' was the only place the highest level of Scientology training ([[OT VIII]]) was offered. It cruised the Caribbean Sea, under the auspices of the Flag Ship Service Organization. The Freewinds was also used for other courses and auditing for those willing to spend extra money to get services on the ship. In April 2008, the ''Freewinds'' was sealed, and work stopped on refurbishments, due to "extensive contamination" with [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite (fibrous riebeckite)|blue asbestos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?n=1&amp;neID=200805023600.3_33bc000d60868fe7|title=Curacao Dry dock Company: Scientology's Cruise Ship Sealed Due To Asbestos Danger|work=Insurance News Net|publisher=insurancenewsnet.com|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a public announcement in 2017, the Church subsequently purchased another vessel on which to administer high-level Scientology training.

== Production facilities ==
=== Golden Era Productions ===
The Golden Era Productions facility is located in the Hollywood Guaranty Building. It produces promotional materials for the Church of Scientology, as well as lectures, training films and other materials related to Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywood.patch.com/listings/golden-era-productions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407193831/http://hollywood.patch.com/listings/golden-era-productions |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliated organizations ==
There are many independently chartered organizations and groups which are staffed by Scientologists, and pay license fees for the use of Scientology technology and trademarks under the control of Scientology management. In some cases, these organizations do not publicize their affiliation with Scientology.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite news |  url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/unwitting-highschoolers-lured-to-forum-run-by-scientologists/2007/03/27/1174761471748.html | title = Unwitting highschoolers lured to forum by Scientologists|work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2007-03-27 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan |last=McEwen |title=Scientology-link group is banned |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=314912004 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=2004-03-18 |accessdate=2007-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122551/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=314912004 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology denies the legitimacy of any splinter groups and factions outside the official organization, and has tried to prevent independent Scientologists from using officially trademarked Scientology materials. Independent Scientologists, also known collectively as the "[[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]]" are referred to as [[squirreling|squirrels]] within the Church. They are also classified by the Church of Scientology as [[suppressive person]]s ("SPs")—opponents or enemies of Scientology.
Hubbard himself stated in Ron's Journal '67 "That there were only seven or eight Suppressive Persons on the planet..."

In 2010, an exception to the rule was made specifically for the [[Nation of Islam]], which is the only officially sanctioned external Dianetics organization and the first official non-Scientology Dianetics org since 1953. Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] publicly announced his embracement of Dianetics, and has been actively promoting Dianetics, while stating he has not become a Scientologist. He has courted a relationship with the Church, and materials and certifications are still required to be purchased from the Church of Scientology, and are not independently produced.&lt;ref name=Auditing&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation of Islam Auditors graduation held for third Saviours' Day in a row |first=Asahed |last=Mohammed |url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_9651.shtml|publisher=Final Call |date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Mothership of All Alliances |first=Eliza |last=Gray |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam |newspaper=[[The New Republic]] |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Farrakhan renews call for self-determination among Nation of Islam followers |first1=Shelley |last1=Rossetter |first2=Thomas C. |last2=Tobin |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/louis-farrakhan-renews-call-for-self-determination-among-nation-of-islam/1128781 |newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |date=October 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105093720/http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/louis-farrakhan-renews-call-for-self-determination-among-nation-of-islam/1128781 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientology Missions International ===
{{Main|Scientology Missions International}}
The Scientology Missions International, the branch of the Church of Scientology devoted to Missions, was set up in 1981. According to the church's official website, the SMI is the "mother church" for all missions, with headquarters in Los Angeles. In 1983, there were forty missions. Currently, the church has grown to an estimated 3,200 missions, churches and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEy-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=scientology+missionary+activities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NDeEatFtEl&amp;sig=bS8sPl4hrpgYCjrWl2XYxDeA_SE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4mtDxr7vJAhVKPj4KHa2dChUQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20missionary%20activities&amp;f=false |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2015-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sea Org ===
{{Main|Sea Org}}

The ''Sea Organization'' (often simply referred to as the "Sea Org") was incorporated under the name  'Operational Transport Committee' in the United Kingdom in 1966 for legal maritime registration purposes. The Sea Org is an unincorporated fraternal religious order founded in 1967 by Hubbard as he embarked on a series of voyages around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in a small fleet of ships staffed by Scientologists and hired professional seamen.  Hubbard—formerly a  [[lieutenant]] junior grade in the US Navy—bestowed the rank of "commodore" of the vessels upon himself. The crew who accompanied him on these voyages became the foundation of the Sea Organisation. The very first members of 'The Sea Project' (1966–67) were high-level trained staff and OTIII completions personally chosen by L. Ron Hubbard from Saint Hill Manor and overseas church missions. The purpose was to establish an effective base of operations for the OTC research voyages to assist LRH to verify his discoveries and research into past-lives. Hubbard was also keen to see if he could recover any deposits of treasure that he believed that he had hidden in dozens of locations around the Mediterranean region. Teams of divers and metal-detectorists were dispatched to remote locations to dig for these alleged deposits. There is evidence of some success in locating identified targets, but only two probable eye-witness testimonies of any artifacts being recovered. One from under a temple complex on Sicily and another from an underwater temple at Carthage. Witnesses have claimed to have seen small craft unloading gold bullion onto the 'Athena' vessel and later seen in Hubbard's personal hold aboard The Apollo Flag ship in 1968 by staff members. (Sources: 'Mission Into Time' and 'Source" magazine. (Issue 9).

The Sea Org is described by the church as forming an elite group of the most dedicated Scientologists, who are entrusted with the international management of Scientology and upper level churches such as the Advanced Organization Los Angeles, American Saint Hill Organization, [[Fort Harrison Hotel|Flag Service Organization]] and [[Celebrity Centres|Celebrity Center International]]. Sea Org members are also in charge of the upper levels of [[Operating Thetan]] (OT) training. The organization is known as the "monastic wing of Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aagaard Petersen |first1=Jesper |title=Controversial New Religions |work=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists who are qualified to do so are often encouraged to join the Sea Org, which involves a lifetime commitment to Scientology organizations in exchange for room and board, training and auditing, and a small weekly allowance.  Members sign an agreement pledging their loyalty and allegiance to Scientology for "the next billion years," committing their future lifetimes to the Sea Org. The Sea Org's motto is "Revenimus" (or "We Come Back").

Critics of Scientology have spoken out against the disciplinary procedures and policies of the Sea Org, which have been [[Scientology controversy|a source of controversy]] since its inception and variously described as abusive and illegal.  Former Sea Org members have stated that punishments in the late 1960s and early 1970s included confinement in hazardous conditions such as the ship's chain locker.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, Margery. ''Understanding Scientology'', Chapter 9. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/us-09.html Reproduced] at [[David S. Touretzky]]'s [[Carnegie Mellon]] site.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Hubbard established the [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] (or RPF) as a subunit of the Sea Org, in order to provide a "second chance" to members whose offenses were considered severe enough to warrant expulsion. RPF members are paired up and help one another for five hours each day with spiritual counseling to resolve the issues for which they were assigned to the program. They also spend 8 hours per day doing physical labor that will benefit the church facility where they are located. On verification of their having completed the program they are then given a Sea Org job again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=moreorless |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2002/scient_rpf_02.htm |title=The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force A Study by Juha Pentikäinen (Chair of the Department of the Study of Religions, University of Helsinki, Finland), Jurgen F.K.

In practice, there have even been reports of child labor and for considerably longer than eight hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scamofscientology.nl/Childslavery.html Scientology = Child Slavery], Scam of Scientology.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of David Miscavige and author of ''Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape'', has stated that as a child she often worked 14 hours a day and only got to see her parents once a week, and sometimes even more seldom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inquisitr.com/577365/former-scientologist-claims-children-forced-into-labor-camp/ Former Scientologist Claims Children Forced Into Labor Camp], ''Inquisitr'', Tara Dodrill, March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteer Ministers ===
{{Main|Volunteer Ministers}}

The Church of Scientology began its "[[Volunteer Ministers]]" program as a way to participate in community outreach projects.  Volunteer Ministers travel to the scenes of major disasters in order to provide assistance with relief efforts.  According to critics, these relief efforts consist of passing out copies of a pamphlet authored by Hubbard entitled ''[[The Way to Happiness]]'', and engaging in a method said to calm panicked or injured individuals known in Scientology as a "[[touch assist]]." Accounts of the Volunteer Ministers' effectiveness have been mixed, and touch assists are not supported by scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sly|first1=Randy|title=Updated: Scientologists in Haiti: Volunteers or Vultures?|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/americas/story.php?id=35377|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Catholic.org|date=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Scientologists are in Nepal trying to 'heal' trauma victims|url=http://www.globalpost.com/article/6550051/2015/05/15/scientologists-are-nepal-trying-heal-trauma-victims|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=Global Post|date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Scientology's global disaster squad|url=https://www.minnpost.com/global-post/2011/04/scientology%E2%80%99s-global-disaster-squad|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=MinnPost|date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious Technology Center (RTC) ===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
{{Main|Religious Technology Center}}

Around 1982 all of the Hubbard's [[intellectual property]] was transferred to a newly formed entity called the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST) and then licensed to the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) which, according to its own publicity, exists to safeguard and control the use of the Church of Scientology's copyrights and trademarks.

The RTC employs lawyers and has pursued individuals and groups who have legally attacked Scientology or who are deemed to be a legal threat to Scientology.  This has included breakaway Scientologists who practice Scientology outside the central church and critics, as well as numerous government and media organizations.  This has helped to maintain Scientology's reputation for litigiousness (see [[Scientology and the legal system]]).

=== ABLE ===
{{Main|Association for Better Living and Education}}
Founded in 1989, the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) is an umbrella organization that administers six of Scientology's social programs:
* [[Applied Scholastics]], educational programs based on Hubbard's "Study Tech."
* [[Criminon]] prisoner rehabilitation programs.

|quote=Dangerous program / In a letter to Fence Post (Dec. 12), Susan Stozewski of the Chicago Church of Scientology attempts to promote a drug rehab program called Narconon. I wish to warn readers that Narconon is a front group for the Church of Scientology.  I found from personal experience that Narconon is a sham and is, in fact, a slick device to lure unsuspecting people into Scientology. An acquaintance of mine recently discovered that she had serious liver damage from Narconon's bogus "purification" program and she now cannot get health insurance coverage.  Another Scientology front group to beware of is the CCHR or Citizens Commission on Human Rights. The CCHR is using tax-exempt funds in a covert campaign to discredit psychiatric-psychology treatment. The CCHR has an extensive network of agents that are distributing distortions about psychiatric treatment and medications such as Prozac and Ritalin. This is a very dangerous thing and people should be aware that it is going on. / Jim Beebe / Northbrook

=== WISE ===
{{Main|World Institute of Scientology Enterprises}}

Many other Scientologist-run businesses and organizations belong to the [[umbrella organization]] World Institute of Scientology Enterprises (WISE), which licenses the use of Hubbard's management doctrines, and circulates directories of WISE-affiliated businesses.  WISE requires those who wish to become Hubbard management consults to complete training in Hubbard's administrative systems; this training can be undertaken at any Church of Scientology, or at one of the campuses of the [[Hubbard College of Administration]], which offers an Associate of Applied Science Degree.
* One of the best-known WISE-affiliated businesses is [[Sterling Management Systems]], which offers Hubbard's management "technology" to professionals such as dentists and chiropractors.
* Another well-known WISE-affiliated business is [[e.Republic]], a publishing company based in Folsom, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/2001-08-23/cover.asp "Scientology Inc."] at Newsreview.com&lt;/ref&gt; e.Republic publications include ''Government Technology'' and ''Converge'' magazines.  The ''Center for Digital Government'' is a division of e. Republic that was founded in 1999.
* Internet ISP [[EarthLink]] was founded by Scientologists [[Sky Dayton]] and [[Reed Slatkin]] as a Scientology enterprise. The company now distances itself from the views of its founder, who moved on to become CEO of [[Helio (wireless carrier)]], formerly known as SK-EarthLink.

{{Main|Scientology controversies}}

Though it has attained some [[Scientology status by country|credibility as a religion]] in many countries, Scientology has also been described as both a [[cult]] and a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name="timecult2"/&gt; Some of the Church's actions also brought scrutiny from the press and law enforcement. For example, it has been noted to engage in harassment and abuse of civil courts to silence its critics, by identifying as [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]] people it perceives as its enemies.&lt;ref name="The Church's War"&gt;{{cite news |first = Richard |last = Leiby |authorlink = Richard Leiby|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070601351.html |title = Scientology Fiction: The Church's War Against Its Critics—and Truth |work=The Washington Post |page = C1 |date = 1994-12-25| accessdate=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Goodin | first=Dan | date=1999-06-03 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-226676.html | title=Scientology subpoenas Worldnet | publisher=CNET News.com | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film [[Going_Clear_(film)|Going Clear]], based on the book by the same name, also documents the controversies surrounding the organization.

=== Classification as church or business ===
From 1952 until 1966, Scientology was administered by an organization called the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists]] (HAS), established in Arizona on September 10, 1952. In 1954, the HAS became the HASI (HAS International). The Church of Scientology was incorporated in California on February 18, 1954, changing its name to "The Church of Scientology of California" (CSC) in 1956. In 1966, Hubbard transferred all HASI assets to CSC, thus gathering Scientology under one tax-exempt roof. In 1967, the IRS stripped all US-based Scientology entities of their tax exemption, declaring Scientology's activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard. Controversy followed the church on those years, but its growth continued in the 1960s. New churches were formed in Paris (1959), Denmark (1968), Sweden (1969), and Germany (1970). In the 1970s the religion spread through Europe: in Austria (1971), Holland (1972), Italy (1978), and Switzerland (1978). Centers of Scientology were in 52 countries by the time the 80s came in and grew to 74 by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=Scientoogy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780199715954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church sued and lost repeatedly for 26 years trying to regain its tax-exempt status. The case was eventually settled in 1993, at which time the church paid $12.5 million to the IRS—greatly less than IRS had initially demanded—and the IRS recognized the church as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Wall Street Journal]]. December 30, 1997 [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/wj301297.html Reproduced] at Dave Touretzky's Carnegie Mellon site&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Scientology also dropped more than fifty lawsuits against the IRS when this settlement was reached. Scientology cites its tax exemption as proof the United States government accepts it as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bonafidescientology.org/Append/09/page00.htm Official Recognition of Scientology as a Religion]". "... the United States Internal Revenue Service in granting ''full religious recognition'' and tax exemption to all Churches of Scientology located in the United States ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, removal of the tax exemption was rated as number 9 in items for the incoming [[Barack Obama]] administration to investigate, as determined in an internet poll run by the presidential transition team soliciting public input for the incoming administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/ideaList.apexp?c=09a800000004fo6&amp;lsi=2 |title= The Citizen's Briefing Book |date= January 20, 2009 |author= Dan McSwain: The Obama-Biden Transition Team |work= Change.gov |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090120001947/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/ideaList.apexp?c=09a800000004fo6&amp;lsi=2 |archivedate= 2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department has criticized Western European nations for discrimination against Scientologists in its published annual International Religious Freedom report, based on the [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/9001.pdf |title=2001 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/ |title=2002 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/ |title=2003 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries Scientology is treated legally as a commercial enterprise, and not as a religion or charitable organization.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} In early 2003, in Germany, The Church of Scientology was granted a tax-exemption for the 10% license fees sent to the US.  This exemption, however, is related to a German-American double-taxation agreement, and is unrelated to tax-exemption in the context of charities law.  In several countries, public proselytizing undergoes the same restrictions as commercial advertising,{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} which is interpreted as persecution by Scientology.

Although the religious nature of Scientology has been questioned both in the United States and around the world, Scientology has been acknowledged as a new religion as manifested in the Church's court victories and the gain of religious rights and privileges that are exclusive to legally established religious bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Melton | first = J. Gordon | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of American Religions | title = Other Psychic New Age Groups | edition = 7th | year = 2003 | publisher = Gale | location = Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many well-established religious organizations, Scientology maintains strict control over its names, symbols, religious works and other writings.  The word ''Scientology'' (and many [[List of trademarks owned by the Church of Scientology and its affiliates|related terms]], including ''L. Ron Hubbard'') is a registered [[trademark]].  Religious Technology Center, the owner of the trademarks and copyrights, takes a hard line on people and groups who attempt to use it in ways unaffiliated with the official Church (see [[Scientology and the legal system]]).

=== Illegal activities ===
{{Main|Operation Snow White|Operation Freakout|Scientology controversies|Fair game (Scientology)}}

L. Ron Hubbard appointed Mary Sue Hubbard to take control of certain aspects of legal protection for the CoS in 1968 and the Office of The Guardian was created with its head office situated at Saint Hill Manor. Under The Guardian's Office (later renamed the [[Office of Special Affairs]] or OSA), Church members and contracted staff from Bureau One later organized and committed one of the largest penetration of United States federal agencies ever perpetrated by an organization not affiliated with a foreign government (that is, one such as the [[KGB]]). This operation was named [[Operation Snow White]] by Hubbard.&lt;ref name=lawhite/&gt; In the trial which followed the discovery of these activities the prosecution described their actions thus:
{{quotation|The crime committed by these defendants is of a breadth and scope previously unheard of. No building, office, desk, or file was safe from their snooping and prying. No individual or organization was free from their despicable conspiratorial minds. The tools of their trade were miniature transmitters, lock picks, secret codes, forged credentials and any other device they found necessary to carry out their conspiratorial schemes.&lt;ref name=lawhite&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientologysidec062490,0,7034344.story Burglaries and Lies Paved a Path to Prison] The LA Times, By Robert W. Welkos and Joel Sappell, June 24, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church has also in the past made use of aggressive tactics in addressing those it sees as trying to suppress them, known as [[Suppressive Person]]s (SPs) first outlined by Hubbard as part of a policy called [[Fair game (Scientology)|fair game]]. It was under this policy that [[Paulette Cooper]] was targeted for having authored ''[[The Scandal of Scientology]]'', a 1970 exposé book about the Church and its founder. This action was known as [[Operation Freakout]]. Using blank paper known to have been handled by Cooper, Scientologists forged bomb threats in her name.&lt;ref name=lawhite/&gt; When fingerprints on them matched hers, the Justice Department began prosecution, which could have sent Cooper to prison for a lengthy term. The Church's plan was discovered at the same time as its Operation Snow White actions were revealed. All charges against Cooper were dismissed, though she had spent more than $20,000 on legal fees for her defense.&lt;ref name=lawhite/&gt;

On January 22, 2013, attorneys for the organization, as well as some of its members, reacted toward the CNN News Group for its airing of a story covering the release of a book published by a former member, entitled 'Going Clear', published earlier the same year.  CNN News Group then chose to publish the reactionary correspondence, with confidential information redacted, on its web site.

Of these activities the current Church laments:{{quotation|...how long a time is the church going to have to continue to pay the price for what the (Guardian Office) did... Unfortunately, the church continues to be confronted with it. And the ironic thing is that the people being confronted with it are the people who wiped it out. And to the church, that's a very frustrating thing.&lt;ref name=lawhite/&gt;}}

According to a 1990 ''Los Angeles Times'' article, in the 1980s the Los Angeles branch largely switched from using church members in harassment campaigns to using private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers.  The reason seemed to be that this gave the church a layer of protection.&lt;ref name="On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes, Los Angeles Times, June 29, 1990"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062990x-story.html#page=1 On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes], ''Los Angeles Times'', Joel Sappell, Robert W. Welkes, page A1, June 29, 1990.  This story is also available on the Carnegie Mellon University library website as [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-6a.html "Part 6: Attack the Attacker, On the Offensive . . . "]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scientology organization has continued to aggressively target people it deems suppressive. In 1998, regarding its announcement that it had hired a private investigator to look into the background of a ''[[Boston Herald]]'' writer who had written a series on the church, Robert W. Thornburg, dean of Marsh Chapel at [[Boston University]], said, "No one I know goes so far as to hire outsiders to harass or try to get intimidating data on critics. Scientology is the only crowd that does that."&lt;ref name="Boston Herald"&gt;{{cite web | first = Jim | last = McLaughlin | author2 = Andrew Gully | title = Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pickets/sp944.htm | publisher = [[Boston Herald]] | date = 1998-02-19 | accessdate = 2009-02-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090210015823/http://solitarytrees.net/pickets/sp944.htm | archivedate = February 10, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has apparently continued as recently as 2010. In 2007 when [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] journalist [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] was making ''[[Scientology and Me]]'', an investigative report about the Church and was the subject of harassment:{{quotation|In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised we were being followed by two cars.

=== Members' health and safety ===
{{see also|Lisa McPherson|Elli Perkins}}

Some key activities of the Church of Scientology carry risks for members, and the deaths of some Scientologists have brought attention to the Church both due to the circumstances of their demises and their relationship with Scientology possibly being a factor.&lt;ref name=timecult1&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865-1,00.html The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power] TIME magazine, May. 06, 1991 By Richard Behar. By all appearances, Noah Lottick of Kingston, Pa., had been a normal, happy 24-year-old who was looking for his place in the world...  his fingers were still clutching $171 in cash, virtually the only money he hadn't yet turned over to the Church of Scientology, the self-help "philosophy" group he had discovered just seven months earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Lisa McPherson was involved in a minor automobile accident while driving on a [[Clearwater, Florida]] street. Following the collision, she exited her vehicle, stripped naked and showed further signs of mental instability, as noted by a nearby ambulance crew that subsequently transported her to a nearby hospital. Hospital staff decided that she had not been injured in the accident, but recommended keeping her overnight for observation. Following intervention by fellow Scientologists, McPherson refused [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] observation or admission at the hospital and checked herself out against medical advice after a short evaluation. She was taken to the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]], a Scientology retreat, to receive a Church sanctioned treatment called [[Introspection Rundown]]. She had previously received the Introspection Rundown in June of that year. She was locked in a room for 17 days, where she died. Her appearance after death was that of someone who had been denied water and food for quite some time, being both underweight and severely dehydrated. Additionally, her skin was covered with over one hundred insect bites, presumably from cockroaches. The state of Florida pursued criminal charges against the Church. The Church has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and now makes members sign a waiver before Introspection Rundown specifically stating that they (or anyone on their behalf) will not bring any legal action against the organization over injury or death.&lt;ref name=nytflchgscos&gt;{{cite news|last=Frantz|first=Douglas|title=Florida Charges Scientology In Church Member's Death|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/14/us/florida-charges-scientology-in-church-member-s-death.html|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These charges attracted press coverage and sparked lawsuits. Eight years later, [[Elli Perkins]], another adherent to Scientology's beliefs regarding [[psychiatry]], was stabbed to death by her mentally disturbed son. Though Elli Perkins's son had begun to show symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] as early as 2001, the Perkins family chose not to seek psychiatric help for him and opted instead for [[Alternative medicine|alternative remedies]] sanctioned by Scientology. The death of Elli Perkins at the hands of a disturbed family member, one whose disease could have been treated by methods and medications banned by Scientology, again raised questions in the media about the Church's methods.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite news

In addition, the Church has been implicated in kidnapping members who have recently left the church. In 2007, Martine Boublil was kidnapped and held for several weeks against her will in Sardinia by four Scientologists. She was found on January 22, 2008, clothed only in a shirt. The room she was imprisoned in contained refuse and an insect infested mattress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French Scientologists Arrested in Italy|publisher=dalje.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Juliet|first=Anne-Cécile|title=L'étrange séquestration qui embarrasse la Scientologie|url=http://bellaciao.org/fr/spip.php?article62595|publisher=Bellaciao.org|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday March 28, 2008, Kaja Bordevich Ballo, daughter of [[Olav Gunnar Ballo]], Norwegian parliament member and vice president of the Norwegian [[Odelsting#Qualified unicameralism|Odelsting]], took a Church of Scientology [[Oxford Capacity Analysis|personality test]] while studying in [[Nice]]. Her friends and co-inhabitants claim she was in good spirits and showed no signs of a mental breakdown, but the report from the Church of Scientology said she was "depressed, irresponsible, hyper-critical and lacking in harmony". A few hours later she committed suicide by jumping from her balcony at her dorm room leaving a note telling her family she was sorry for not "being good for anything". The incident has brought forward heavy criticism against the Church of Scientology from friends, family and prominent Norwegian politicians.&lt;ref name="dgbtkbb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/04/15/532571.html |title="Ville vært i live i dag hvis hun ikke hadde gått til scientologene" - Innenriks - Dagbladet.no |location=FR |publisher=Dagbladet.no&lt;! |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inga Marte Thorkildsen]], parliament member, went as far as to say "Everything points to the scientology cult having played a direct role in making Kaja choose to take her own life".&lt;ref name="dgbtkbb" /&gt;

[[File:Scientology Free Stress Test.jpg|thumb|A Scientologist administers a [[stress testing|stress test]] using an [[e-meter]].]]
Members of the public entering a Scientology center or mission are offered a "free personality test" called the [[Oxford Capacity Analysis]] by Scientology literature. The test, despite its name and the claims of Scientology literature, has no connection to Oxford University or any other research body. Scientific research into three test results came to the conclusion that "we are forced to a position of skepticism about the test's status as a reliable psychometric device" and called its scientific value "negligible".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Foster Report]]. Chapter 5, "The Practices of Scientology;" section (a), "Recruitment;" pages 75-76.

=== Legal waivers ===
{{See also|Introspection Rundown}}
Recent legal actions involving Scientology's relationship with its members (see [[Scientology controversy]]) have caused the organization to publish extensive legal documents that cover the rights granted to followers.  It has become standard practice within the organization for members to sign lengthy legal contracts and waivers before engaging in Scientology services, a practice that contrasts greatly with almost every mainstream religious organization. In 2003, a series of media reports examined the legal contracts required by Scientology, which state, among other things, that followers deny any psychiatric care their doctors may prescribe to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~jeta/scn/scans/Introspection-Release.html Reproduced version] of Introspection Rundown Release Contract&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists can attend classes, exercises or counseling sessions for a set range of "fixed donations"; however, membership without courses or auditing is possible.

Critics say it is improper to fix a donation for religious service; therefore the activity is non-religious. Scientology points out many classes, exercises and counseling may also be traded for "in kind" or performed cooperatively by students for no cost, and members of its most devoted orders can make use of services without any donations bar that of their time. A central tenet of Scientology is its [[Doctrine of Exchange]], which dictates that each time a person receives something, he or she must give something back. By doing so, a Scientologist maintains "inflow" and "outflow", avoiding spiritual decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;court=US&amp;case=/us/490/680.html |title='&amp;#39;Hernandez v.

=== Ireland ===
As in most European countries, the Church of Scientology is not officially recognized in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as a charitable organization, but it is free to promote Scientology beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lyons: [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/troubled-scientology-church-in-ireland-is-now-1m-in-red-95169.html Troubled Scientology Church in Ireland is now €1m in red], ''[[The Irish Independent]]'', June 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish government has not invited the Church of Scientology to national discussions on secularization by the Religious Council of Ireland.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, according to Israeli professor of psychology Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, "in various organizational forms, Scientology has been active among Israelis for more than thirty years, but those in charge not only never claimed the religion label, but resisted any such suggestion or implication. It has always presented itself as a secular, self-improvement, tax-paying business."&lt;ref name="Beit-Hallahmi" /&gt;  Those "organizational forms" include a Scientology Organization in [[Tel Aviv]]. Another Israeli Scientology group called "The Way to Happiness" (or "Association for Prosperity and Security in the Middle East") works through local Scientologist members to promote [[The Way to Happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Moran | last = Rada | title = Scientology infiltrates summer camps | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3409789,00.html | publisher = [[Ynetnews]] | date = 2007-06-07 | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An Israeli [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]] chapter runs campaigns against perceived abuses in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cchr.org.il/ |title=CCHR Israel Homepage |publisher=Cchr.org.il |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Scientology campaigns, such as "[[Youth for Human Rights International]]" are active as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Tali | last = Heruti-Sover | title = Youth group supported by Scientology | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3353985,00.html | publisher = [[Ynetnews]] | date = 2007-01-19 | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an ultra-Orthodox Jewish group that opposes Scientology and other cults or missionary organizations in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/irf/irf_rpt/1999/irf_israel99.html|title=The page you're looking for may have been moved or renamed|website=State.gov|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev L'Achim]], whose anti-missionary department in 2001 provided a hotline and other services to warn citizens of Scientology's "many types of front organizations".&lt;ref&gt;April 18, 2001.

=== Russia ===
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] [[Church of Scientology Moscow versus Russia|ruled in April 2007]] that Russia's denial to register the Church of Scientology as a religious community was a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (freedom of assembly and association) read in the light of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=815108&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Judgment on Application no. 18147/02 by CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF MOSCOW against Russia] (April 5, 2007).

=== Spain ===
On October 31, 2007, the National Court in Madrid issued a decision recognizing that the National Church of Scientology of Spain should be entered in the Registry of Religious Entities.
The administrative tribunal of Madrid's High Court ruled that a 2005 justice ministry decision to scrap the church from the register was "against the law." Responding to a petition filed by the church, the ruling said that no documents had been presented in court to demonstrate it was anything other than a religious entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spanish court rules Scientology can be listed as a religion |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-V0Ui506lPl-r8ImubpdUjFbuYA |agency=AFP |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2008-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226104617/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-V0Ui506lPl-r8ImubpdUjFbuYA |archivedate=December 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = J.

In 1979 Hubbard's wife, [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], along with ten other highly placed Scientology executives were convicted in United States federal court regarding [[Operation Snow White]], and served time in an American federal prison. Operation Snow White involved infiltration, wiretapping and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).

In 1993, however, the United States IRS recognized Scientology as a "non-profit charitable organization," and gave it the same legal protections and favorable tax treatment extended to other non-profit charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51783695.html?dids=51783695:51783695&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+24%2C+1993&amp;author=DAVID+DAHL&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.A&amp;desc=IRS+examined+Scientology+dollars%2C+not+dogma&amp;pf=1 |title=IRS examined Scientology dollars, not dogma |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Dahl |first=David |date=1993-10-24 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001011225/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51783695.html?dids=51783695%3A51783695&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS%3AFT&amp;date=Oct%2B24%2C%2B1993&amp;author=DAVID%2BDAHL&amp;pub=St.%2BPetersburg%2BTimes&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.A&amp;desc=IRS%2Bexamined%2BScientology%2Bdollars%2C%2Bnot%2Bdogma&amp;pf=1 |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article says that Scientologists paid private investigators to obtain compromising material on the IRS commissioner and blackmailed the IRS into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Douglas | last = Frantz | title = Scientology's Puzzling Journey From Tax Rebel to Tax Exempt | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/us/scientology-s-puzzling-journey-from-tax-rebel-to-tax-exempt.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times | date = 1997-03-09 | accessdate = 2008-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 legal case involving a married couple attempting to obtain the same deduction for charity to a Jewish school, it was stated by Judge Silverman:&lt;ref&gt;Judge Barry Silverman [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/12/12/0672961.pdf ''MICHAEL SKLAR; MARLA SKLAR v.

{{quotation|An IRS closing agreement cannot overrule Congress and the Supreme Court. If the IRS does, in fact, give preferential treatment to members of the Church of Scientology—allowing them a special right to claim deductions that are contrary to law and rightly disallowed to everybody else—then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to ''that'' policy.}}

To date (2008) such a suit is not known to have been filed. In further appeal in 2006, the US Tax Court again rejected couple's deduction, stating: {{quotation|We conclude that the agreement reached between the Internal Revenue Service and the Church of Scientology in 1993 does not affect the result in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/Sk2lar.TC.WPD.pdf UNITED STATES TAX COURT, MICHAEL AND MARLA SKLAR, Petitioners v.

Docket No. 395-01. Filed December 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, this matter is still ongoing. On February 8, 2008, three judges in the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals "expressed deep skepticism" over the IRS's position that treatment of Scientology is "irrelevant to the deductions the Orthodox Jews, Michael and Marla Sklar, took for part of their children's day school tuition and for after-school classes in Jewish law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Gerstein  | first =Josh  | title =Judges Press IRS on Church Tax Break  | work =[[The New York Sun]]  | publisher =The New York Sun, One SL, LLC.   | date =February 8, 2008  | url =http://www.nysun.com/article/70957  | accessdate = 2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Corchorus''''' is a [[genus]] of about 40–100 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the family [[Malvaceae]], native to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.&lt;ref name="malv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Tiliaceae.info/Genera/Corchorus/Corchorus.html|title=	The Corchorus (Jute) Pages|author=Stewart Robert Hinsley|publisher=Malvaceae Info|accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different [[common names]] are used in different contexts, with [[jute]] applying to the [[fiber]] produced from the plant, and '''mallow-leaves''' for the leaves used as a [[vegetable]].

==Description==
The plants are tall, usually annual [[herb]]s, reaching a height of 2–4 m, unbranched or with only a few side branches. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, simple, [[lanceolate]], 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The [[flower]]s are small (2–3&amp;nbsp;cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the [[fruit]] is a many-seeded capsule.

==Taxonomy==
The genus ''Corchorus'' is classified under the [[subfamily]] [[Grewioideae]] of the family [[Malvaceae]]. It contains around 40 to 100 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/genus.pl?2918 |title=''Corchorus'' L. |work=[[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=2003-06-05 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Oceanopapaver'', previously of uncertain placement, has recently been [[synonymy (biology)|synonymized]] under ''Corchorus''. The name was established by Guillaumin in 1932 for the single species ''Oceanopapaver neocaledonicum'' Guillaumin from [[New Caledonia]]. The genus has been classified in a number of different families including [[Capparaceae]], [[Cistaceae]], [[Papaveraceae]], and [[Tiliaceae]]. The putative family name "Oceanopapaveraceae" has occasionally appeared in print and on the web but is a [[nomen nudum]] and has never been validly published nor recognised by any [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Whitlock, K. G. Karol, and W. S. Alverson. 2003. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/344760 Chloroplast DNA Sequences Confirm the Placement of the Enigmatic ''Oceanopapaver'' within ''Corchorus'' (Grewioideae: Malvaceae s.l., Formerly Tiliaceae)]. ''International Journal of Plant Sciences'' 164: 35–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Corchorus'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his great work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753). It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word κόρχορος or κόρκορος (''korkhoros'' or ''korkoros'') which referred to a wild plant of uncertain identity, possibly jute or wild [[asparagus]].&lt;ref name="asagray"&gt;{{cite book |author=Asa Gray |year=1849 |title=The Genera of the Plants of the United States |volume=Vol. II |page=94 |publisher=George P.

''Corchorus'' leaves are consumed in the cuisines of various countries. ''Corchorus olitorius'' is used mainly in the cuisines of southern [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]], ''Corchorus capsularis'' in [[Japan]] and [[China]].  It has a [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] (somewhat "slimy") texture, similar to [[okra]], when cooked. The [[seeds]] are used as a flavouring, and a [[herbal tea]] is made from the dried leaves. The leaves of ''Corchorus'' are rich in [[betacarotene]], [[iron]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin C]]. The plant has an [[antioxidant]] activity with a significant α-[[tocopherol]] equivalent [[vitamin E]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In North Africa and the Middle East, the young leaves of ''Corchorus'' species are known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''[[malukhiyah]]'' and are used as green [[leafy vegetable]]s . ''Malukhiyah'' is eaten widely in Egypt and some consider it the [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian national dish]]. It is featured in cuisines from [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syrian cuisine|Syria]], [[Jordanian cuisine|Jordan]] and [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisia]]. In [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], the plant is known as ''molohiya'' or ''molocha'' and is usually cooked into a kind of chicken stew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/culture/cuisine/veg/molohiya.html|title=Vegetable dishes: Molohiya|publisher=Turkish-Cypriot Cuisine|accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves of ''Corchorus'' have been a staple [[Egypt]]ian food since the time of the [[Pharaoh]]s and it is from there that it gains its recognition and popularity. Varieties of mallow-leaves stew with rice is a well known [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].

In [[Cuisine of Nigeria|Nigerian cuisine]], especially amongst the [[Yoruba People|Yorubas]], it is commonly used in a stew known as ''[[ewedu]]'', a condiment to other starch-based foods such as ''[[Amala, (food)|amala]]'' or added with gbegiri a local nigeria soup. In [[Northern Nigeria]] it is known as ''Ayoyo''. They use it to cook a sauce called (''Miyan Ayoyo'') which is commonly served with [[Tuwon Masara]] or [[Tuwon Allebo]].

In [[Ghana]], it is mostly eaten by the people in the North and it is called ayoyo. It is mostly eaten with Tuozaafi (food prepared with cornflour).

In [[Sierra Leone]] it is known as ''krain krain'' (or ''crain crain'') and is cooked as stew. The stew is usually eaten with rice or ''[[foofoo]]'' (a traditional food made from [[cassava]]).&lt;ref name="umcor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umcor/ngo/sierraleone/|title=UMCOR Sierra Leone Archives |quote=In Bandajuma village, these beneficiaries of an UMCOR Sierra Leone food security program are harvesting the first crop of krain krain, for sale and own consumption. |website=UMCOR NGO (United Methodist Committee on Relief Non-Governmental Organization) |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919040153/http://gbgm-umc.org/umcor/ngo/sierraleone/ |archivedate=September 19, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tenove"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicwebsite.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?PublicationID=749 |title=Cultivating research in a war-ravaged city |author=Chris Tenove |publisher=International Development Research Centre |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404061717/http://publicwebsite.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?PublicationID=749 |archivedate=April 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jute leaves are also consumed among the [[Luhya people]] of Western [[Kenya]], where it is commonly known as ''mrenda'' or ''murere''. It is eaten with starchy foods like ''[[ugali]]'', a staple for most communities in Kenya.&lt;ref name="Kari"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kari.org/fileadmin/Publications/AR2004/2%202004KARI_ar_hort_9_african%20leafy%20vegetables.pdf |title=African Leafy Vegetables |publisher=Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406130055/http://www.kari.org/fileadmin/Publications/AR2004/2%202004KARI_ar_hort_9_african%20leafy%20vegetables.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Sudan it is called ''khudra'', meaning "green" in [[Sudanese Arabic]]. The [[Songhai people]] of [[Mali]] call it ''fakohoy''.

In [[India]], it is locally known as ''nalta sag''. It is a favorite food during the summer months, especially in [[Sambalpur]] and the western part of [[Odisha]]. Usually it is lightly sauteed  and eaten along with rice or rice gruel.

In the [[Philippines]], ''C. olitorius'' is known as ''saluyot''. It is commonly consumed as a leafy vegetable together with [[bamboo shoot]]s.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20100215-253310/Saluyot-now-a-popular-vegetable-worldwide|title=Saluyot now a popular vegetable worldwide|author=Danny O.

'''Countertrade''' means exchanging goods or services which are paid for, in whole or part, with other goods or services, rather than with money. A monetary valuation can however be used in countertrade for accounting purposes. In dealings between sovereign states, the term [[bilateral trade]] is used.

== Types of countertrade ==
There are six main variants of countertrade:

*[[Barter]]: Exchange of goods or services directly for other goods or services without the use of money as means of purchase or payment. 
:''Barter is the direct exchange of goods between two parties in a transaction. The principal exports are paid for with goods or services supplied from the importing market. A single contract covers both flows, in its simplest form involves no cash. In practice, supply of the principal exports is often held up until sufficient revenues have been earned from the sale of bartered goods. One of the largest barter deals to date involved [[Occidental Petroleum Corporation]]'s agreement to ship [[sulphuric acid]] to the former Soviet Union for ammonia urea and potash under a 2 year deal which was worth 18 billion euros. Furthermore, during negotiation stage of a barter deal, the seller must know the market price for items offered in trade. Bartered goods can range from hams to iron pellets, mineral water, furniture or olive-oil all somewhat more difficult to price and market when potential customers must be sought.''

*Switch trading: Practice in which one company sells to another its obligation to make a purchase in a given country.
*Counter purchase: Sale of goods and services to one company in other country by a company that promises to make a future purchase of a specific product from the same company in that country.
*Buyback: occurs when a firm builds a plant in a country - or supplies technology, equipment, training, or other services to the country and agrees to take a certain percentage of the plant's output as partial payment for the contract.
*Offset: Agreement that a company will offset a hard - currency purchase of an unspecified product from that nation in the future. Agreement by one nation to buy a product from another, subject to the purchase of some or all of the components and raw materials from the buyer of the finished product, or the assembly of such product in the buyer nation.
* Compensation trade: Compensation trade is a form of barter in which one of the flows is partly in goods and partly in hard currency.

== Necessity ==
Countertrade also occurs when countries lack sufficient [[hards currency]], or when other types of market trade are impossible.

In 2000, [[Government of India|India]] and [[Iraq]] agreed on an "[[oil for food|oil for wheat and rice]]" barter deal, subject to [[United Nations]] approval under Article 50 of the UN [[Persian Gulf War]] sanctions, that would facilitate 300,000 barrels of oil delivered daily to India at a price of $6.85 a barrel while Iraq oil sales into Asia were valued at about $22 a barrel. In 2001, India agreed to swap 1.5 million tonnes of Iraqi crude under the oil-for-food program.

The [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] noted: "... although locally produced food items have become increasingly available throughout the country, most Iraqis do not have the necessary purchasing power to buy them. Unfortunately, the monthly food rations represent the largest proportion of their household income. They are obliged to either barter or sell items from the food basket in order to meet their other essential needs. This is one of the factors which partly explains why the nutritional situation has not improved in line with the enhanced food basket. Moreover, the absence of normal economic activity has given rise to the spread of deep-seated poverty."

==Role of countertrade in the world market==
Countertrade transactions have been basically conducted among the former Soviet Union and its allies in the Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. The reason that these countries have allocated a big portion of their commerce to the countertrade attributed to insufficient hard currency. 
A significant proportion of international commerce, possibly as much as 25%, involves the barter of products for other products rather than for hard currency. Countertrade may range from a simple barter between two countries to a complex web of exchanges meeting the needs of all countries involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M., and McGowen, J., (2013) "BUSN 5," South - Western Cengage Learning, Mason, OH. {{ISBN|1111826730}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted US economist [[Paul Samuelson]] was skeptical about the viability of countertrade as a marketing tool, claiming that "Unless a hungry tailor happens to find an undraped farmer, who has both food and a desire for a pair of pants, neither can make a trade". (This is called "[[double coincidence of wants]]".) But this is arguably too simplistic an interpretation of how markets operate in the real world. In any real economy, bartering occurs all the time, even if it is not the main means to acquire goods and services.

The volume of countertrade is growing. In 1972, it was estimated that countertrade was used by business and governments in 15 countries; in 1979, 27 countries; by the start of the 1990s, around 100 countries (Verzariu, 1992). A large part of countertrade has involved sales of military equipment (weaponry, vehicles and installations).

More than 80 countries nowadays regularly use or require countertrade exchanges. Officials of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) organization claimed that countertrade accounts for around 5% of the world trade. The British Department of Trade and Industry has suggested 15%, while some scholars believe it to be closer to 30%, with east-west trade having been as high as 50% in some trading sectors of Eastern European and Third World Countries for some years. A consensus of expert opinions (Okaroafo, 1989) has put the percentage of the value of world trade volumes linked to countertrade transactions at between 20% to 25%.

According to an official US statement, "The [[U.S. Government]] generally views countertrade, including barter, as contrary to an open, free trading system and, in the long run, not in the interest of the U.S. business community. However, as a matter of policy the U.S. Government will not oppose U.S. companies' participation in countertrade arrangements unless such action could have a negative impact on national security".&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget; "Impact of Offsets in Defense-related Exports", December 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In a specifically sexual context, the term "cruising" originally emerged as an [[argot]] "code word" in [[gay slang]], by which those "in the know" would understand the speaker's unstated [[Human sexuality|sexual]] intent, whereas most [[heterosexual]]s, on hearing the same word in the same context, would normally misread the speaker's intended meaning in the word's more common (and presumably less threatening) nonsexual sense. This served (and in some contexts, still serves) as a protective [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] mechanism for [[gay]] men to recognize each other, and avoid being recognized by those who may wish to do them harm in broader societies noted for their [[homophobia]].

In the latter half of the twentieth century, decriminalization of homosexual behaviour increasingly became the norm in English-speaking countries. The protective barrier once provided by the term "cruising" as a "code word" has therefore largely broken down and, arguably, become increasingly irrelevant. Thus the specifically sexual meaning of the term has passed into common usage to include the sexual behavior of heterosexual persons, as well.

Public health officials have noted that cruising locations are frequented by [[men who have sex with men]], but do not identify with being homosexual or bisexual, who are closeted, married, or in relationships with women, do not date men or frequent gay bars, clubs or websites, or have otherwise no other way of meeting men for sex.&lt;ref name="aquabone"&gt;[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2001-12-19/article/9057?headline=Tradition-of-sex-cruising-at-Aquatic-Park-to-end Tradition of sex cruising at Aquatic Park to end]. John Geluardi. ''Berkeley Daily Planet''. 19-12-2001. Retrieved 17-01-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional usage variants==
In the [[United States]], the term "cruising" was used predominantly to denote exclusively homosexual behavior, but in [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] it is used by both homosexuals and heterosexuals to describe their own behavior, as witnessed in the common male heterosexual derivative phrase "cruising for chicks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Revolver|date=Jan 2007|issue=52|issn=1527-408X|quote=For display purposes and cruising for chicks at the Renaissance fair only...|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Texas Monthly|date=November 1989|volume=17|issn=0148-7736|quote=People sat on trunks and hoods and partied, while the center two lanes were bumper to bumper with cars cruising for sex and drugs.|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carpenter, Humphrey|year=1981|title=W.&amp;nbsp;H. Auden: A Biography|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-04-928044-9|quote=The length of the list might suggest that Auden was in the habit of 'cruising' - picking up boys for casual sex|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, cruising often takes place in [[gay bar]]s, [[adult video arcade]]s often through [[glory hole (sexual slang)|gloryholes]], [[adult movie theater]]s, [[public toilet]]s, [[park]]s, [[sauna]]s, [[gym]]s or [[gay bathhouse]]s.  Engaging in such activities in public places like parks has led to participants being charged with [[indecent exposure]].

==Historic examples of usage==
The term has been enshrined since at least the mid-1970s in the name of the [[gay bar]] ''Foxes Booze 'n' Cruise'', located on [[U.S. Route 66|Historic US Highway 66]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. Before closing, the business came under criticism for allegedly encouraging drunk driving by some who did not understand the term's historic usage, but the name and the sign remain a conscious reminder of [[gay history]].

The term has also been adopted, in an altered form, by the website qruiser.com, an online LGBT community based in [[Sweden]]. This is a tongue in cheek reference, however, as the community functions as a forum for social interaction for the Scandinavian region, rather than focusing on exclusively sexual encounters. The website has attracted many heterosexual members as well.

==In popular culture==
Cruising for sex is alluded to in songs such as "[[Cruisin' the Streets]]" by the [[Boys Town Gang]] as well as "I'm a Cruiser" by the [[Village People]], on the album titled ''[[Cruisin' (album)|Cruisin']]''. In 1980, director [[William Friedkin]] made the movie ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]]. The film introduced many audiences to homosexual activities and the linguistic codes used for them, but [[gay rights]] groups perceived a negative depiction of the [[gay community]] in the film and protested its production.

The opening scene of the first episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'' involves the main character Patrick ([[Jonathan Groff]]) cruising in a park, mainly out of curiosity of whether the activity is still in practice or not. 

Cruising for sex was explored in [[Cruising Pavilion]], a 2018 art installation associated with the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Venice Bienalle of Architecture]].

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Laos]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Laos]]' population was estimated at about {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Lao People's Democratic Republic}}|,||}}/1e6 round 2}} million in {{UN_Population|Year}}, dispersed unevenly across the country. Most people live in valleys of the [[Mekong]] River and its tributaries. [[Vientiane Prefecture]], which includes [[Vientiane]], the capital and largest city of the country, had about 569,000 residents in 1999. The country's population density is 23.4/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In March 2005, the total population was 5.62 million (2.82 million females, 2.80 million males) in the 2005 census, an increase of 1.047 million since the previous 1995 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/PopulationCensus2005_chapter1.htm Population Census 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The demographic makeup of the population is uncertain as the government divides the people into three groups according to the altitude at which they live, rather than according to ethnic origin. The lowland Lao ([[Lao Loum]]) account for 68%, upland Lao ([[Lao Theung]]) for 22%, and the highland Lao ([[Lao Soung]], including the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and the [[Yao people|Yao]]) for 9%.

Ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]], the principal lowland inhabitants and politically and culturally dominant group, make up the bulk of the Lao Loum and around 60% of the total population. The Lao are a branch of the [[Tai people]] who began migrating southward from [[China]] in the first millennium A.D. In the north, there are mountain tribes of [[Miao–Yao]], Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Yao people|Yao]], [[Akha people|Akha]], and [[Lahu people|Lahu]] who migrated into the region in the 19th century. Collectively, they are known as [[Lao Sung]] or highland Lao.

In the central and southern mountains, [[Mon–Khmer]] tribes known as [[Lao Theung]] or upland Lao, predominate.  Some Chinese minorities remain, particularly in the towns, but many [[Laotian Chinese]] were forced to leave during 1975-80 when Laos followed the anti-Chinese policy of Vietnam.

The predominant religion is [[Theravada]] Buddhism. [[Animism]] is common among the mountain tribes. [[Buddhism]] and spirit worship coexist easily.  There is a small number of [[Christianity|Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s.

The official and dominant language is [[Lao language|Lao]], a [[tonal language]] of the [[Tai languages|Tai]] linguistic group. Midslope and highland Lao speak tribal languages. [[French language|French]], once common in government and commerce, has declined in use, while knowledge of [[English language|English]] — the language of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) — has increased in recent years.

With a median age of 19.3, Laos has the youngest population of Asia.

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}}, the population of Laos increased from 1.7 million in 1950 to {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Lao People's Democratic Republic}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million in {{UN_Population|Year}}. Until the year 2000 the proportion of children 0–14 years of age was over 40% of the total population. Due to decreasing fertility rates this proportion decreased to 34.5% in 2010. The proportion of elderly people is still very low (3.9%), although the proportion doubled between 1950 and 2010.

==Ethnic groups==
{{See|List of ethnic groups in Laos}}

[[Image:LaosDSCN4342a.jpg|200px|thumb|In [[Luang Prabang]], a young woman at the time of a Hmong Meeting Festival.]]
Specialists are largely in agreement as to the ethnolinguistic classification of the ethnic groups of Laos.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"&gt;[http://www.asianlii.org/asia/other/ADBLPRes/2006/4.pdf Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of the 1995 census, the government of Laos recognized 149 ethnic groups within 47 main ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt; whereas the [[Lao Front for National Construction]] (LFNC) recently revised the list to include 49 ethnicities consisting of over 160 ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt;

The term ''ethnic minorities'' is used by some to classify the non-Lao ethnic groups, while the term ''indigenous peoples'' is not used by the Lao PDR.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt; These 160 ethnic groups speak a total of 82 distinct living languages.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=LA Ethnologue report for Laos]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lao people|Lao]] 55%, [[Khmu people|Khmu]] 11%, [[Hmong people|Hmong]] 8%, [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] 2%, other (over 100 minor ethnic groups) 26% (2005 census).

The '''ecumene''' ([[American English|US]]) or '''oecumene''' ([[British English|UK]]; {{lang-grc-gre|οἰκουμένη}}, ''oikouménē'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"inhabited") was an ancient Greek term for the known, the inhabited, or the habitable world. Under the [[Roman Empire]], it came to refer to [[civilization]] as well as the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is most often used in the context of "[[Ecumenism|ecumenical]]" and describes the [[Christian Church]] as a unified whole, or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in [[cartography]] to describe a type of [[world map]] (''[[mappa mundi]]'') used in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|A modern depiction of the ecumene described by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term cited above is the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[present tense|present]] [[middle voice|middle]] [[participle]] of the verb {{lang|grc|οἰκέω}} (''oikéō'', "to inhabit") and is a [[clipping (morphology)|clipped form]] of {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη γῆ}} (''oikouménē gē'', "inhabited world").&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]. "œcumene, ''n''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greece==
[[Image:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] world map from the [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] (Johannes Schnitzer, 1482).]]
[[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (276–196&amp;nbsp;BC) deduced the [[circumference of the Earth]] with remarkable accuracy (within 10% of the correct value). The Greek cartographer [[Crates of Mallus|Crates]] created a globe about 150&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Klein | first =Samuel John | contribution =Oecumene | year =2005 | title =Cartography Word of the Day | publisher =Designorati | url = http://designorati.com/articles/t1/cartography/462/cartography-word-of-the-day-oecumene.php | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (83–161) calculated the Earth's surface in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']] and described the inhabited portion as spanning 180&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[longitude]] (from the [[Fortunate Isles]] in the west to [[Serae]] and [[Serica]] ([[China]]) in the east) and about 80&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[latitude]]{{refn|Although Ptolemy did not measure [[latitude]] with degrees but with hours of [[midsummer]] daylight, from 12 at the equator to 24 in the [[Arctic Circle|arctic]].}} (from [[Thule]] in the north to anti-[[Meroë]] below the [[equator]]). Ptolemy was well aware that the Romans knew only about a quarter of the globe{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and his erroneous belief that the [[Indian Ocean]] was landlocked led to expectation of a [[terra incognita]] ("unknown land"). In fact, [[symmetry]] led him to expect that there should be three other continents to balance the ecumene: Perioeci ({{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"beside the ecumene"), Antoeci ("opposite the ecumene") and the [[Antipodes]] (“opposite the feet”).

==Rome==
The cameo [[Gemma Augustea]] includes a Roman artistic personification of Oikoumene as she crowns an emperor, probably [[Augustus]], perhaps for bringing peace to the (Roman) world.

[[Image:THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.]]
The word was adopted within [[Christianity]] after [[Constantine the Great]]'s assembly of a [[synod]] of [[bishop]]s from all over the world at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

By that time, the Greek term had come to refer more specifically to the civilized world and then simply the [[Roman Empire]]. This usage continued after the [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian Reforms]] and the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] used it to refer to their imperial administration. [[Constantinople]] was the "Ecumenical City" and, after 586, the Patriarch of Constantinople was known as the "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]". [[Pope Gregory I]] objected to the adoption of this style by [[John IV of Constantinople]], as it implied a universal jurisdiction he believed to be held by the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Schaff | first =Philip | author-link =Philip Schaff | contribution =Gregory and the Universal Episcopate | year =1882 | title =History of the Christian Church | volume =IV: Mediaeval Christianity: A.D. 590–1073 | place=Peabody, Massachusetts  | publisher =Hendrickson Publishers; 3rd edition (July 1, 1996)  | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc4.i.iv.iv.html | accessdate =2008-01-03 | isbn =978-1-56563-196-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Fifth Epistle berates John for having "attempted to seize upon a new name, whereby the hearts of all your brethren might have come to take offence",&lt;ref&gt;St&amp;nbsp;Gregory&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great.

The name continues to be borne by the [[Greek Orthodox]] patriarchs, although with the more restricted sense that they are the bishops of the former imperial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution =The Universal Patriarch | title =The Witness | volume =XXV, No. 13, August 3/16, 1981 | place=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher =Holy Transfiguration Monastery | url = http://www.homb.org/st_annas/Articles/UniversalPatriarch.pdf | accessdate =2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==

===Religion===
{{main|Ecumenism}}
[[Image:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|right|220px|An ecumenical worship service at [[Taizé Community]].]]
Especially in the 20th century, the term has been employed to refer to unified [[Christian Church]] which is the ultimate goal of [[Ecumenism]], a movement to promote cooperation among the various [[Christian denomination]]s. The movement is not accepted by many Christian groups. The work of ecumenism takes place in the form of negotiations conducted between committees of various denominations and also through the deliberations of inter-denominational organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]]. Relevant issues include [[Baptism]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Christian ministry|Ministry]].

===Culture===
[[File:Spread of Oecumene Mesopotamia.jpg|thumb|Known world of the Mesopotamian, Babylonian, and Assyrian cultures from documentary sources]]
In the context of [[cultural history]], [[Lewis Mumford]] used the term "ecumene" in an academic sense in his work, ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mumford | first = Lewis | author-link = Lewis Mumford | year = 1934 | title = Technics and Civilization | place = New York | publisher = Harcourt | url = http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720153921/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/technics.html | archivedate = 2008-07-20 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]]  later popularized it in his [[The Rise of the West | ''Rise of the West'']] (1963), suggesting that a single global ecumene emerged through the dominance of European political institutions, science, technology, and economic forms from the late 18th century onwards. One could argue that prior to the great voyages of discovery carried out by [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Vasco da Gama]], and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], there were originally two separate ecumenes—one covering the [[Old World]] and one the [[New World|New]]. The Spanish [[conquistador]]es fused these two ecumenes to form a single integrated "[[World-systems theory|world system]]".

[[Peter Sloterdijk]] uses the terms "First Ecumene" and "Second Ecumene" in his book ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/01/world-interior-capital-peter-sloterdijk-review In the World Interior of Capital]'' (2014, original German: ''Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals'', 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860834263|title= In the world interior of capital : for a philosophical theory of globalization|last= 1947-|first= Sloterdijk, Peter,|publisher= |others= Hoban, Wieland,|year= |isbn= 9780745647692|edition = English|location= Cambridge, UK|pages= 143–148|oclc= 860834263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sloterdijk takes these terms directly from the work of [[Eric Voegelin]], specifically from ''Order and History'' vol. 4, ''The Ecumenic Age'' (1974), &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21151456|title= The collected works of Eric Voegelin|last= 1901-1985.|first= Voegelin, Eric,|date= 2007|origyear= 1989|publisher= [[Louisiana State University Press]]|others= Sandoz, Ellis, 1931-, Weiss, Gilbert,, Petropulos, William,|isbn= 9780826213013|location= Baton Rouge|oclc= 21151456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} which he quotes.

Note that the term "ecumene" can differ depending on the viewpoint from which it is perceived: for example, the Ancient Babylonians and the Ancient Greeks would each have known a different area of the world (though their worlds may have overlapped). Compare image to the right.

=== Cartography ===
The term is used in [[cartography]] and the historical cartography to describe a type{{which|date=March 2015}} of symbolic, schematic [[world map]] made in [[late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

{{Culture of Japan}}
According to [[census]] statistics, 98.5% of the population of [[Japan]] are [[Japanese people|Japanese]], with the remainder being foreign nationals residing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexmundi.com/japan/ethnic_groups.html CIA World Factbook] Retrieved on 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these statistics measure [[citizenship]], not [[ethnicity]], with all domestic minorities such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Ryukyuans]], [[Burakumin]], and [[Naturalization|naturalized immigrants]] being counted as simply "[[Japanese people|Japanese]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arudou|first1=Debito|title=Census blind to Japan's true diversity|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2010/10/05/issues/census-blind-to-japans-true-diversity/#.VxQMVXLALFZ|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]''|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government does not collect data on the [[Ethnic groups of Japan|ethnic identities of its citizens]], claiming that there are no issues of race relations among Japanese citizens as they are all of the same race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uog.edu/sites/default/files/arudou_embedded-racism-japanese-law.pdf |format=PDF |title=‘Embedded Racism’ in Japanese Law: Towards a Japanese Critical Race Theory |author=[[Debito Arudou]] |website=Uog.edu |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Japan doesn't recognize North Korean nationality/citizenship

The above statistics do not include the approximately 30,000 U.S. military stationed in Japan, nor do they account for illegal immigrants. The statistics also do not take into account minority groups who are Japanese citizens such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] (an aboriginal people primarily living in Hokkaido), the [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]] (who may or may not be considered ethnically [[Yamato people]]), naturalized citizens from backgrounds including but not limited to Korean and Chinese, and citizen descendants of immigrants. The total legal resident population of 2012 is estimated at 127.6 million.

==Japanese ethnic minorities==
The nine largest minority groups residing in Japan are: North and South [[Koreans in Japan|Korean]], [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese]], [[Brazilians in Japan|Brazilian]] (many Brazilians in Japan have [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese ancestors]]), [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipinos]], [[Taiwanese in Japan|Taiwanese]], the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] indigenous to [[Hokkaido]], and the [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]] indigenous to [[Okinawa]] and [[Ryukyu Islands|other islands]] between [[Kyushu]] and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/opinions/view/is-japan-really-racist|title=Is Japan really racist?  ‹ Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burakumin]], an outcast group at the bottom of Japan's [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan|feudal order]], are sometimes included.&lt;ref&gt;Neary, Ian, "Burakumin in contemporary Japan," in Japan's Minorities: The Illusion of Homeogeneity, Michael Weiner, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of smaller ethnic communities in Japan with a much shorter history.

According to the United Nations' 2008 Diène report, communities most affected by racism and xenophobia in Japan include:&lt;ref&gt;Diène,

===Korean people===
{{Main|Koreans in Japan}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Kenkanryu cover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Manga Kenkanryu (マンガ 嫌韓流, Manga Kenkanryū?), translated as '''Manga—The Anti-Korean Wave''']] --&gt;

''Zainichi'' (resident in Japan) [[Korea]]ns are permanent residents of Japan registered as [[Joseon]] (Korean: 조선, Japanese: Chōsen, 朝鮮) or South Korean nationality. Joseon was annexed by Japan in 1910, therefore Zainichi Koreans with Joseon citizenship are de facto stateless. After [[World War II]], 2 million Koreans living in Japan were granted a temporary Joseon nationality under the US military government (because there was no government in Korea then). However, the meaning of Joseon nationality became vague as Korea was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union, and in 1948 North and South Korea established their own governments, respectively. Some obtained South Korean citizenship later, but others who opposed the division of Korea or sympathized with North Korea maintained their Joseon nationality because people are not allowed to register North Korean nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Japan does not recognize North Korea as a country.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Zainichi came to Japan from [[Korea under Japanese rule|1910 to 1945]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]] ''Zainichi (Koreans in Japan)'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of this immigration is said to be the result of Korean landowners and workers losing their land and livelihood due to Japanese land and production confiscation initiatives and migrating to Japan for work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} According to the calculation of [[Rudolph Rummel]], a total of 5.4 million Koreans were also [[Conscription|conscripted]] into forced labor, and shipped throughout the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. Of these, 210,000 to 870,000 Koreans died during forced labor in places such as [[Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R. J. | last=Rummel | title=Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1990 | publisher=Lit Verlag | year=1999 | editor= | isbn=3-8258-4010-7}}

During the [[occupation of Korea by Japan]], the Japanese government enforced a policy of forced assimilation. Korean culture was oppressed; the [[Korean language]] was labeled a dialect (方言) of Japanese and banned, Koreans were forced to learn and speak Japanese, and Koreans were forced to take Japanese names. However, Korean people resisted this, and by the end of the 1940s it was almost completely undone.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Ethnic Koreans in Japan were massacred as scapegoat in the chaos of [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|the Great Kanto earthquake]] in 1923.

Many Korean refugees also came to the country during the [[Jeju uprising]] in the [[First Republic of South Korea]]. Though most migrants returned to Korea, [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]] estimates in 1946 indicated that 650,000 Koreans remained in Japan.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After World War II, the Korean community in Japan was split between allegiance to [[South Korea]] ([[Mindan]]) and [[North Korea]] ([[Chongryon]]).

Zainichi who identify themselves with Chongryon are also an important money source of North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Anna Fifield in Seoul, Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo, Mark Turner in New York and agencies | title = N.

Japanese law does not allow dual citizenship for adults over 22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/MINJI/minji06.html|title=法務省|work=moj.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until the 1980s required adoption of a Japanese name for citizenship. Partially for this reason, many Zainichi did not obtain Japanese citizenship as they saw the process to be humiliating.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Although more Zainichi are becoming Japanese citizens, issues of identity remain complicated. Even those who do not choose to become Japanese citizens often use Japanese names to avoid discrimination and live their lives as if they were Japanese. This is in contrast with the Chinese living in Japan, who generally use their Chinese names and openly form Chinatown communities.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

An increase in tensions between Japan and North Korea in the late 1990s led to a surge of attacks against Chongryon, the pro-North residents organisation, including a pattern of assaults against Korean schoolgirls in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/terror-attacks-on-koreans-rise-in-japan-1184794.html Terror attacks on Koreans rise in Japan] accessed at November 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, Chongryon enjoyed unofficial immunity from searches and investigations, although it has long been suspected of a variety of criminal acts on behalf of North Korea, such as illegal transfer of funds to North Korea and espionage.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese authorities have recently started to crack down on Chongryon with investigations and arrests. These moves are often criticized by Chongryon as acts of political suppression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/228th_issue/2006041508.htm FM Spokesman Urges Japan to Stop Suppression of Chongryon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210031805/http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/228th_issue/2006041508.htm |date=February 10, 2011 }}, [[Choson Sinbo]], 5/13/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tokyo Governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] referred to Chinese and Koreans as ''[[sangokujin]]'' (三国人) in 2000 in the context of foreigners being a potential source of unrest in the aftermath of an earthquake, the foreign community complained. Historically, the word has often been used pejoratively and Ishihara's statement brought images of the massacre of Koreans by civilians and police alike after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] to mind. Therefore, the use of the term in context of potential rioting by foreigners is considered by many as provocative, if not explicitly racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/06/29/national/anti-korean-groups-plea-to-use-public-facility-nixed/|title=Anti-Korean group's plea to use public facility nixed|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/05/23/national/nationalism-rearing-ugly-head-with-greater-frequency/|title=Nationalism rearing ugly head with greater frequency|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/08/04/national/rallies-dent-business-in-koreatown/|title=Rallies dent business in Koreatown|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130826p2a00m0na006000c.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831060206/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130826p2a00m0na006000c.html |archivedate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/views/opinion/AJ201309020006 |title=INTERVIEW/ Yasumichi Noma: Giving hatemongers a taste of their own medicine |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017220719/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/views/opinion/AJ201309020006 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/2000-rally-against-hate-speech-in-tokyos-shinjuku|title=2,000 rally against hate speech in Tokyo's Shinjuku ‹ Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201309230105 |title=More than 1,000 rally against discrimination, hate speech in Tokyo |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017220623/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201309230105 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201312120046 |title=National Police Agency expresses concerns about xenophobic groups |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017220722/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201312120046 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201312130059 |title=INTERVIEW: Foreigners' rights activist says new secrecy law may encourage xenophobia |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017220725/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201312130059 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pad/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=152045 |title=Anti-hallyu voices growing in Japan |publisher=M.koreatimes.co.kr |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/08/national/crime-legal/japanese-high-court-upholds-ruling-anti-korean-activists-hate-speech/|title=Japanese high court upholds ruling against anti-Korean activists' hate speech|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainland Chinese people===
{{Main|Chinese people in Japan}}
Mainland Chinese are the largest minority in Japan (according to the 2008 statistics as shown above). Mainland Chinese in particular have been targets of anti-immigrant sentiment along with government, police and media portrayal of them as being likely to commit crime. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
Indeed, an investigator from the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) said, racism against [[Koreans]] and Chinese is deeply rooted in Japan because of history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-07/2005-07-11-voa9.cfm |title=Voice of America news: UN Independent Investigator Raps Japan for Discrimination |publisher= |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204153432/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-07/2005-07-11-voa9.cfm |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwanese people===
There are a number of Taiwanese people that reside in Japan due to close (yet unofficial) ties between Taiwan and Japan.  Taiwan was a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945 and Taiwanese during this time were considered Japanese citizens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In general, Taiwanese people are treated relatively well comparing to other minority groups such as Chinese and Koreans due to the positive image towards Taiwan among Japanese people&lt;ref&gt;Ka, G. (2014). The postwar transition of legal status of Zainichi Taiwanese (''Sengo zainichi Taiwan-jin no houteki chi no hensen''). ''Gendai Taiwan Kenkyu (Modern Taiwanese Studies)'', 45, pp.1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Renhō]], the leader of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016)|Democratic Party]], is known to be the most famous Taiwanese-Japanese politician.

Japanese ultra-nationalist governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] insulted the Taiwanese, referring to them as [[Sangokujin]]-

:I referred to the "many ''sangokujin'' who entered Japan illegally." I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used ''[[gaikokujin]]'', or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.

:... After World War II, when Japan lost, '''the Chinese of Taiwanese origin''' and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.

:... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.&lt;ref name="TimeInterview"&gt;"[http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html 'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091806/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html |date=April 8, 2013 }}," ''TIME Asia'', April 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ainu===
{{Main|Ainu people}}
The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] are an indigenous group mainly living in [[Hokkaidō]]. 

At present, the official Japanese government estimate of the population is 25,000, though this number has been disputed with unofficial estimates of upwards of 200,000.&lt;ref name="Poisson, B 2002, p.5"&gt;Poisson, B. 2002, ''The Ainu of Japan'', Lerner Publications, Minneapolis, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ryukyuan people===
{{Main|Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyū independence movement}}
The [[Ryukyuans|Ryukyuan people]] lived in an independent [[Ryukyu Kingdom|kingdom]] until it became a vassal of Japan's [[Satsuma Domain]] in 1609. The kingdom, however, retained a degree of autonomy until 1879 when the islands were officially annexed by Japan as [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. They are now Japan's largest minority group, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa and 300,000 living in other areas of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noguchi|2001|p=69}}{{cnf|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Okinawan language]], the most widely spoken [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan language]], is related to Japanese, the two being in the [[Japonic languages]]. Ryukyuan languages were heavily suppressed through a policy of forced assimilation throughout the former [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] after it was annexed in 1879. With only [[Japanese language|Japanese]] taught in schools and students punished for speaking or writing their native language through the use of [[dialect card]]s, the younger generations of Ryukyuans began to give up their "backwards" culture for that of Japan. The Japanese government officially labels the Ryukyuan languages as dialects (Hōgen) of Japanese, although they are not mutually intelligible with one another, or even between each other. In 1940, there was a political debate amongst Japanese leaders about whether or not to continue the oppression of the Ryukyuan languages, although the argument for assimilation prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, Patrick. ''Hōgen ronsō: the great Ryukyuan languages debate of 1940.'' Contemporary Japan – Journal of the German Institute for Japanese Studies, Tokyo. Aug2013, Vol. 25 Issue 2, p167-187. 21p. 4 Charts. {{ISSN|1869-2729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese soldiers outright shot people who spoke Ryukyuan languages during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], believing they were spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Brooke |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/news/oki.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114010134/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/news/oki.php |archivedate=2006-01-14 |title=1945 suicide order still a trauma on Okinawa |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still some children learning Ryukyuan languages natively, but this is rare especially on mainland Okinawa. The language still is used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music, or folk dance.

After the annexation of the islands, many Ryukyuans, especially Okinawans, migrated to the mainland to find jobs or better living conditions. They were sometimes met with discrimination, such as workplaces with signs that read, "No Ryukyuans or Koreans."&lt;ref&gt;Inoue, Masamichi S. ''Okinawa and the U.S. Military: Identity Making in the Age of Globalization.'' Columbia University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1903 Osaka Exhibition, an exhibit called the "Pavilion of the World" (Jinruikan) had actual Okinawans, Ainu, Koreans, and other "backwards" peoples on display in their native clothes and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/adv/wol/dy/campus/newreport_0903_10.html |title=News Report:Campus Now:Waseda Online |website=Yomiuri.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fierce fighting in the Battle of Okinawa, Japanese soldiers committed multiple atrocities against Okinawan civilians, including rape and murder, using them as human shields, and forcing them to commit suicide. In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education]] attempted to revise school textbooks to lessen mention of these atrocities, but was met with massive demonstrations in Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122806/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}, ''Japan Times'', June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Okinawa-against-Tokyo%E2%80%99s-attempts-to-rewrite-history-9666.html |title=JAPAN Okinawa against Tokyo’s attempts to rewrite history – Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] is also close to southern China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia reflecting its long history of trade with these regions. However, because of the standard use of Japanese in schools, television, and all print media in Okinawa, these cultural differences are often glossed over in Japanese society. Consequently, many Japanese consider Okinawans to be Japanese, sometimes ignoring their distinct cultural and historical heritage in insensitive ways.

Western foreigners in Japan, particularly those from Europe, North America, Australia and [[New Zealand]], are often called 外国人 ''Gaikokujin'' or 外人 ''[[Gaijin]]''.  The first large influx of such foreigners occurred in the 1980s, when the Japanese government adopted a policy to give scholarships to large numbers of foreign students to study at Japanese universities.

In addition, as the Japanese economy grew quickly in the 1980s, a sizable number of Westerners began coming to Japan. Many found jobs as [[Eikaiwa school|English conversation]] teachers, but others were employed in various professional fields such as finance and business. Although some have become permanent residents or even [[naturalization|naturalized citizens]], they are generally perceived as short-term visitors and treated as outsiders of Japanese society.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Keidanren]] business lobbying organization advocated a policy of allowing South Americans of Japanese ancestry (mainly [[Japanese Brazilian|Brazilians]] and [[Japanese Peruvian|Peruvians]]) to work in Japan, as Japan's industries faced a major labor shortage. Although this policy has been decelerated in recent years, many of these individuals continue to live in Japan, some in [[ethnic enclave]]s near their workplaces.

Many people from Southeast Asia (particularly [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]]) and Southwest Asia (and [[Iran]]) also entered Japan during this time, making foreigners as a group a more visible minority in Japan. Those foreigners are called 来日 ''Rainichi'' ("coming to Japan") in contrast to 在日 ''Zainichi'' ("in Japan"). The TBS television series ''[[Smile (2009 TV series)|Smile]]'' is about Bito Hayakawa who was born to a Japanese mother and Filipino father, and struggled to overcome the difficulties faced as a mixed race child.

The main concerns of the latter groups are often related to their legal status, a public perception of criminal activity, and general discrimination associated with being non-Japanese.

[[Sakhalin]], which was once part of Japan as [[Karafuto Prefecture]], had indigenous populations of [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] and Uilta ([[Orok people|Orok]]). Like the [[Sakhalin Koreans|Karafuto Koreans]] but unlike the Ainu, they were thus not included in the [[Evacuation of Karafuto and Kuriles|evacuation of Japanese nationals]] after the Soviet invasion in 1945. Some Nivkhs and Uilta who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|held in Soviet work camps]]; after court cases in the late 1950s and 1960s, they were recognised as Japanese nationals and thus permitted to migrate to Japan. Most settled around [[Abashiri, Hokkaidō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2004|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{ill|Uilta Kyokai|ja|ウィルタ協会}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/~bunkt/ Uilta Kyokai of Japan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303235222/http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/~bunkt/ |date=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded to fight for Uilta rights and the preservation of Uilta traditions in 1975 by [[Dahinien Gendānu]].

There are a few [[:jp:欧米系島民|Creole people]] in the [[Bonin Islands]].

Although protection and refugee status has been granted to those seeking asylum from Myanmar, the same has not been offered to refugee [[Kurds in Japan]] from Turkey. Without this protection and status, these Kurds who have fled from Turkey due to persecution are generally living in destitution, with no education and having no legal residency status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/03/national/japans-kurds-often-limbo-despite-significant-community/#.Vi2nMStGQrd|title=Japan's Kurds often in limbo, despite significant community – The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thejapantimes/posts/10153047164913344|title=The Japan Times – Some 1,000 Kurds live in Saitama's... – Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic issues==

===Pre-war xenophobia===
Racial discrimination against other Asians was habitual in Imperial Japan, having begun with the start of Japanese colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Meiji era]] Japanese showed a contempt for other Asians. This was exemplified in an editorial titled ''[[Datsu-A Ron]],'' which advocated that Japan treat other Asians as other [[Western imperialism in Asia|western empires]] treat them. The Shōwa regime preached racial superiority and racialist theories, based on nature of ''[[Yamato-damashii]].'' According to historian Kurakichi Shiratori, one of Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s teachers: "Therefore nothing in the world compares to the divine nature (''shinsei'') of the imperial house and likewise the majesty  of our national polity (''[[kokutai]]''). Here is one great reason for Japan's superiority."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War'', 1998, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus]]'', a classified report in 1943 of the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] completed on July 1, 1943, just as a family has harmony and reciprocity, but with a clear-cut hierarchy, the Japanese, as a [[Supremacism|racially superior people]], were destined to rule Asia "eternally" as the head of the family of Asian nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The World War Two Reader| last=Martel| first=Gordon| publisher=Routledge| location=New York| year=2004| ISBN =0-415-22403-9| pages=245–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most horrific xenophobia of the pre-Shōwa period was displayed after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], where in the confusion after a massive earthquake, Koreans were wrongly maligned as poisoning the water supply. A vicious [[pogrom]] resulted in the deaths of at least 3,000 Koreans, and the imprisonment of 26,000.

Attacks against Western foreigners and their Japanese friends by nationalist citizens, rose in the 1930s under the influence of [[Japanese military-political doctrines in the Showa period]], after a long build-up starting in the [[Meiji period]] when only a few ''[[samurai]]'' die-hards did not accept foreigners in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Bob Tadashi, ''Anti-Foreignism and Western Learning in Early-Modern Japan'', Council on East-Asian Studies, Harvard University, 1986. {{ISBN|0-674-04037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For an exception, see [[Jewish settlement in the Japanese Empire]].

Racism was omnipresent in the press during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Greater East Asia War]] and the media's descriptions of the superiority of the [[Yamato people]] was unwaveringly consistent.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Earhart,'' Certain Victory'', 2008, p.335&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major anti-foreigner publicity campaign, called ''Bōchō'' (Guard Against Espionage), was launched in 1940 alongside the proclamation of the ''Tōa shin Shitsujō'' (New Order in East Asia) and its first step, the ''[[Hakkō ichiu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Earhart,'' Certain Victory'', 2008, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly after the launching of the [[Pacific War]], Westerners were detained by official authorities, and on occasion were objects of violent assaults, sent to police jails or military detention centers or suffered bad treatment in the street. This applied particularly to [[United States|Americans]] and [[United Kingdom|British]]; in [[Manchukuo]] at the same period [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] attacks were carried out against Chinese and other non-Japanese.

===Post-war government policy===
[[File:Transition of Foreigners in Japan.png|left|thumb|400px|Transition of Numbers of Registered Foreigners in Japan from 5 Major Countries, based on ''Immigration Control 2007'', by the Immigration Bureau, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]], 2007-9-21.]]
Because of the low importance placed on assimilating minorities in Japan, laws regarding ethnic matters receive low priority in the legislative process.&lt;ref name="japantoday.com"&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japan-disputes-racism-allegations-at-un-panel#show_all_comments ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234515/http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japan-disputes-racism-allegations-at-un-panel |date=June  4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in 1997, "Ainu cultural revival" legislation was passed which replaced the previous "Hokkaido Former Aboriginal Protection" legislation that had devastating effects on the Ainu in the past.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Article 14 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] states that all ''people'' (English version) or ''citizens'' (revised Japanese version) are equal under the law, and they cannot be discriminated against politically, economically, or socially on the basis of race, belief, sex, or social or other background.

However, Japan does not have [[civil rights]] legislation which prohibits or penalizes discriminatory activities committed by citizens, businesses, or non-governmental organizations.

Attempts have been made in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] to enact human rights legislation. In 2002, a draft was submitted to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], but did not reach a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2005_May_16/ai_n13829869 |work=Japan Policy &amp; Politics |title=LDP forgoes immediate Diet submission of human rights bill |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928222403/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2005_May_16/ai_n13829869 |archivedate=September 28, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Had the law passed, it would have set up a Human Rights Commission to investigate, [[name and shame]], or financially penalize discriminatory practices as well as hate speech committed by private citizens or establishments.

Another issue which has been publicly debated but has not received much legislative attention is whether to allow permanent residents to vote in local legislatures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} ''Zainichi'' organizations affiliated with North Korea are against this initiative, while ''Zainichi'' organizations affiliated with South Korea support it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Finally, there is debate about altering requirements for work permits to foreigners. Currently, the Japanese government does not issue work permits unless it can be demonstrated that the person has certain skills which cannot be provided by locals.

===Access to housing and other services===
A handful of apartments, motels, night clubs, brothels, sex parlours and public baths in Japan have put up signs stating that foreigners are not allowed, or that they must be accompanied by a Japanese person to enter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debito.org/roguesgallery.html "THE ROGUES' GALLERY" PHOTOS OF PLACES IN JAPAN WHICH EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT NON-JAPANESE CUSTOMERS] on Debito's official website accessed at January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many Japanese claim that these signs are very rare and the prohibitions are due to perceived social incompatibility—for example, foreigners may not understand Japanese bathhouse etiquette—and not racism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In February 2002 plaintiffs sued a Hokkaido bathhouse in district court pleading racial discrimination, and on November 11 the Sapporo District Court ordered the bathhouse to pay the plaintiffs ¥1 million each in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there were a substantial number of lawsuits regarding discrimination against foreigners. For example, in 2005, a Korean woman who attempted to rent a room was refused because she was not a Japanese citizen. She filed a discrimination lawsuit, and she won in Japanese court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/10/05/2007100561017.html|title=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition): Daily News from Korea – Korean Woman Wins Discrimination Damages in Japan|work=chosun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Discrimination toward foreign nationals in their searches for homes continues to be one of the biggest problems", said the head of the Ethnic Media Press Centre. Organizers of the service said they hope to eradicate the racism that prevents foreigners, particularly Non-Westerners, from renting apartments since there are currently no laws in Japan that ban discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/e06a5300f90fa0238025668700518ca4/a80788bbc13a7676c1256be90035b864/$FILE/G0213907.pdf a UNHCHR report PREVENTION OF DISCRIMINATION The rights of non-citizens]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher learning===
Although foreign professors teach throughout the Japanese higher education system, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070803014118/http://ns.eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jp/member/index.php?_urid=1386&amp;_lang=ja Robert J. Geller] of [[University of Tokyo]] reported, in 1992, that it was extremely rare for them to be given [[tenure (academic)|tenure]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Geller, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/258/5087/1421.pdf Letters: Tenure for Foreigners in Japan], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', '''258''', 5087, 1421 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Japanese citizens and crimes===
{{Further|Crime in Japan}}

As in other countries, foreigners sometimes do work that is not allowed by their visas, or overstay the terms of their visas. Their employment tends to be concentrated in fields where most Japanese are not able to or no longer wish to work.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A large portion of crimes by immigrants are by Chinese in Japan, and some highly publicized crimes by organized groups of Chinese (often with help of [[Yakuza|Japanese organized crime]]) have led to a negative public perception.&lt;ref name="worries"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Worries About a Trend: Crime by Chinese|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 12, 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/world/japan-worries-about-a-trend-crime-by-chinese.html | first=Sheryl | last=Wudunn | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, foreigners from Africa were responsible for 2.8 times as much crime per capita as Japanese natives but were slightly less likely to commit violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wa-pedia.com/gaijin/foreign_crime_in_japan.shtml|title=Crime in Japan : analysis per nationality- Wa-pedia|work=Wa-pedia|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to National Police Authority records, in 2002, 16,212 foreigners were caught committing 34,746 crimes, over half of which turned out to be visa violations (residing/working in Japan without a valid visa).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The statistics show that 12,667 cases (36.5%) and 6,487 individuals (40.0%) were Chinese, 5,272 cases (15.72%) and 1,186 individuals (7.3%) were Brazilian, and 2,815 cases (8.1%) and 1,738 individuals (10.7%) were Korean. The total number of crimes committed in the same year by Japanese was 546,934 cases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Within these statistics, Japanese committed 6,925 violent crimes, of which 2,531 were arson or rape, while foreigners committed 323 violent crimes, but only 42 cases are classified as arson or rape.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Foreigners were more likely to commit crimes in groups: About 61.5% of crimes committed by foreigners had one or more accomplice, while only 18.6% of crimes committed by Japanese were in groups.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

By a 2010 study by the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] illegal residents decreased from 219,000 in 2004 to 113,000 in 2008, and in addition, the number of arrested foreign visitors decreased from 21,842 in 2004 to 13,880 in 2008. The percentage of foreign nationals in all arrestees charged in penal code crimes was about 2.0% and this number has remained relatively stable. While the percentage of foreign nationals among all arrestees charged in cases involving robbery or burglary was around 5.5% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

The former head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Emergency Public Safety Task Force, Hiroshi Kubo, published a book called {{Nihongo|''Chian wa Hontouni Akkashiteirunoka''|治安はほんとうに悪化しているのか}} (in English: ''Is Public Safety Really Deteriorating?'', {{ISBN|978-4-86162-025-6}}) disputing foreign crime statistics, suggesting that such statistics were being manipulated by politicians for political gain. He suggested, for example, that including visa violations in crime statistics is misleading. He also said that the crime rate in Tokyo is based on reported rather than actual crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debito.org/?p=17|title=Ex-deputy of Tokyo Gov.

===Comment by U.N. special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia===
In 2005, a United Nations special [[rapporteur]] on racism and xenophobia expressed concerns about deep and profound racism in Japan and insufficient government recognition of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unic.or.jp/new/pr05-057-E.htm |title=Press Conference by Mr Doudou Diène, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=2007-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065052/http://www.unic.or.jp/new/pr05-057-E.htm |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4671687.stm "Japan racism 'deep and profound".] [[BBC News]] (July 11, 2005). Retrieved 2007-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doudou Diène]] ([[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Commission on Human Rights]]) concluded after an investigation and nine-day tour of Japan that racial discrimination and [[xenophobia]] in Japan primarily affects three groups: national minorities, descendants of former [[Japanese colonies]], and foreigners from other Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imadr.org/geneva/2006/G0610396.pdf |format=PDF|title='Overcoming "Marginalization" and "Invisibility"', International Movement against all forms of Discrimination and Racism |accessdate=2007-01-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214115324/http://imadr.org/geneva/2006/G0610396.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]], from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in spite of the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, believe it is more accurate to describe Japan as a multiethnic society.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]] ''Multiethnic Japan'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Such claims have long been rejected by other sectors of Japanese society such as former Japanese Prime Minister [[Tarō Asō]], who has once described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/10/18/national/aso-says-japan-is-nation-of-one-race/ Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race']". The Japan Times. October 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'', a Japanese national newspaper, while expressing a support for combating discrimination, expressed doubt on the impartiality of the report, pointing out that Doudou Diène never visited Japan before and his short tour was arranged by a Japanese NGO, IMADR (International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination). The chairman of the organization is Professor Kinhide Mushakoji (武者小路公秀), who is a board member (and the former director of the board) of the [[International Institute of the Juche Idea]] ([http://juche.v.wol.ne.jp/en.htm 主体思想国際研究所]), an organization whose stated purpose is to propagate ''[[Juche]]'', the official ideology of North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;桑原聡, "報告の陰に連携" (産経新聞「妙」, November 13, 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, according to the UN [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], Japan's record on racism has improved, but there is still room for progress.&lt;ref name="japantimes20100226"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/02/26/national/japan-faces-u-n-racism-criticism/#.VGQjdfTF_Kk|title=Japan faces U.N. racism criticism|date=February 26, 2010|work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was critical of the lack of anti-hate speech legislation in the country and the treatment of Japanese minorities and its large Korean and Chinese communities.&lt;ref name="japantimes20100226"/&gt; The ''[[Japan Times]]'' quoted committee member Regis de Gouttes as saying that there had been little progress since 2001 (when the last review was held) "There is no new legislation, even though in 2001 the committee said prohibiting hate speech is compatible with freedom of expression."&lt;ref name="japantimes20100226"/&gt; Many members of the committee, however, praised the Japanese government's recent recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous people.&lt;ref name="japantimes20100226"/&gt;

In February 2015, [[Ayako Sono]], a former member of an education reform panel, wrote a controversial column in [[Sankei Shimbun]] suggesting that more foreign workers be imported to meet labor shortages, but that they be separated from native Japanese in a system of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/12/an-advisor-to-pm-abe-praises-apartheid-says-it-might-help-japan.html|title=The Newspaper Columnist Who Wants to Bring Apartheid to Japan|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/02/13/author-causes-row-with-remarks-on-immigration-segregation/|title=Author Causes Row With Remarks on Immigration, Segregation|author=Yuka Hayashi|work=WSJ|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/20/national/outrage-grows-sono-apartheid-column/|title=Outrage grows over Sono 'apartheid' column – The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/11414141/Japanese-author-provokes-furious-South-African-response-by-suggesting-a-new-apartheid.html|title=Japanese author provokes furious South African response by suggesting a new apartheid|date=February 15, 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later explained "I have never commended apartheid, but I do think that the existence of a ‘Chinatown’ or ‘Little Tokyo’ is a good thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author Sono denies praising apartheid as criticism, bewilderment continue |date=February 17, 2015 |publisher=Asahi Shimbun |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201502170033 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223032440/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201502170033 |archivedate=February 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1418">The '''flatplan''' is a page plan of a publication that shows how the articles and adverts are laid out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalism.co.uk/terms-definitions-dictionary-terminology-words/s54/ Journalism glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The flatplanning process==
A flatplan shows where all articles and adverts are laid out, and in what order.  It allows complete control of the publication production process avoiding confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printmediamag.co.uk/prepress-definitions/flatplanning.aspx Print Media Mag]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without a flatplan, the production director and advertisement director struggle to control which pages go where.  This makes signing off a publication very difficult and time-consuming.

Flatplans started life drawn out on pieces of paper stuck to the wall of the production team.  As pages moved around, and advertisements were booked (and cancelled) the pages were annotated and amended.

Nowadays, paper flatplans are being replaced by digital flatplans.  These systems link the data in a flatplan with other systems.  Many synchronise with [[Adobe InDesign]] updating with the most recent version of the artwork for each page as the designer is working on it.  Other examples include linking to ad booking systems where copy chasing is automated.  Increasingly, such systems sit at the centre of the [[prepress]] workflow.

'''Godoberi''' (also spelled '''Ghodoberi''') (self-designation Gijbdilhi mitts) (also called годоберинский язык, ღოდობერიული ენა, годоберийский язык, гъибдилIи мицци, Ɣibdiƛi micci, Godoberin) is an [[Andic languages|Andic language]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language family]] spoken by the [[Godoberi people|Godoberi]] in southwestern [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]]. It is spoken by approximately 130 people.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2314|title=Ghodoberi|last=|first=|date=|website=Endangered Languages Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two dialects which are Godoberi and Zibirhali, and the main difference is in pronunciation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire|last=Kolga|first=Margus|publisher=NGO Red Book|year=2001|isbn=|location=Tallinn|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Endangered Languages Project classifies the language as endangered based on the number of native speakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The anthropological development of the Godoberis is unknown. The Godoberi language is what distinguishes the cultural group from other groups in the area. When compared to other Andic languages, Godoberi is considered the most similar to Chamalal and Botlikh languages. Some words are influenced by Avar, Turkish, and Arab. After being incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century and then ruled by the Soviet Union in the 20th century, there is a strong Russian influence in the Godoberi language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
The native speakers of Godoberi live in two villages Godoberi (''Gjudu'' in Godoberi) and Zibirhali (''Shalu'' in Godoberi). These villages are located in the northwest mountains on the left bank of the Andi-Koisu River in southwest Dagestan, a republic of Russia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Status ==
Godoberi is not a written language, and it is used only in the home. Schools teach the children Avar and Russian, and this is an influential factor in the death of the language. The native speakers of Godoberi use Avar or Russian as a written form of communication. These two languages are also used when speaking to people from neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sounds/Phonology ==
The Godoberi language has five vowels: ''i, u, e, o, a.'' Diphthongs, two vowels combined in one syllable to make one sound, are found only in Godoberi and no other Daghestanain languages (example: ''c'ai'' 'fire').&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Godoberi|last=Kibrik|first=Aleksandr|publisher=Lincom|year=1996|isbn=|location=Munchen|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monophthongs are also found in Godoberi. There are 13 total: ''i, e, a, o, u, i:, e:, a:, o:, u:, ˜i, ã, ˜u.'' The accentual system is extremely complex especially for nouns.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
Singular words are divided into three gender classes: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Plural words are not divided into gender classes, but they are divided as human or object. There are two types of adjectives: primary and participles. A majority of the primary adjectives do not denote gender classes. The four types of participles are past, present, future, and non-future negative.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The numerical system does not vary greatly from other languages. Verb morphology is also regular compared to other languages in the Andic language family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5107">The '''Grantham Prize''' was an annual journalism award awarded between September 2005 and October 2012. It was established by [[Jeremy Grantham]] and Hannelore Grantham and the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting to annually recognize the work of one [[journalist]] or a team of journalists for exemplary reporting on the environment.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web|author= The Grantham Foundation|year=2012|title=About the Grantham Prize|publisher=The Grantham Foundation|accessdate=16 April 2013|url=http://www.granthamprize.org/about/aboutheprize}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jyg1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Leo Hickman|date=12 April 2013|title= Jeremy Grantham, environmental philanthropist: 'We're trying to buy time for the world to wake up'|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/12/jeremy-grantham-environmental-philanthropist-interview?INTCMP=SRCH
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The public deserves ready access to the kind of information and news that only outstanding independent journalism can provide," the Granthams said in announcing the prize. They say they want their annual award of $75,000 to "give that kind of reporting the honor, respect, and visibility it needs."

The purpose of the Prize was to encourage outstanding coverage of the environment, to recognize reporting that has the potential to bring about constructive change, and to broadly disseminate the Prize-winning story to increase public awareness and understanding of issues focusing on the environment.

The prize was awarded annually to non-fiction made available to a general audience in the United State or Canada during the previous calendar year in newspapers, magazines, books, television, cable, radio, or online.

Among the criteria jurors consider are the significance of the subject matter, quality and originality of the journalism, and the effort involved in telling the story. The Grantham Prize entries was judged by an independent panel of jurors, chaired by David Boardman, ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]''. Other journalists on the jury included Robert B. Semple, Jr., ''[[The New York Times]]''; James Hamilton, Charles S. Sydnor Professor of Public Policy at "[[Duke University]]"; Susanne Reber, Center for Investigative Reporting; Deborah Potter, NewsLab, Philip Meyer, Professor, emeritus professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] School of Journalism and Mass Communication and Diane Hawkins-Cox, formerly of CNN.

The Grantham Prize was funded by Jeremy Grantham and Hannelore Grantham through The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment. The foundation seeks to raise awareness of urgent environmental issues and supports individuals and organizations working to find solutions. Their grantmaking supports communication and collaboration in environmental protection, with an emphasis on climate change.  

The Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting was established in 1997 with funding from three journalism foundations and the Belo Corporation, The Providence Journal Charitable Foundation, and the Philip L. Graham Fund, and also from the Telaka Foundation. The Institute was established as a memorial to Michael Metcalf, a visionary leader in newspaper journalism and, from 1979 to 1987, the Publisher of The Providence Journal Bulletin. The Metcalf Institute provides science and environmental science training for reporters and editors to help improve the accuracy and clarity of reporting on marine and environmental issues.

'''Harmful influence of technology''' refers to the negative effect of technology which comes along with all of the useful implementations of variety of devices and innovations. People are constantly exposed to waves and radiation emitted from various appliances that are in everyday use. 

== Influence of the mobile/cell phones ==
[[File:Cell-phone-radiation-cancer.jpg|thumb|Influence of the phone on the human brain]]
The rapid increase of the number of users of the [[Mobile phone|mobile phones]] started in the last twenty years of the 20th century, and now multi-functionality of [[smartphone]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s attract more and more users all around the world according to the Das S, Chakraborty S and  Mahanta B. in "A study on the effect of prolonged mobile phone use on pure tone audiometry thresholds of medical students of Sikkim". However, the researchers declare that despite the multi-functionality, the mobile devices have the negative effect on human's body, head in particular. Furthermore, the researchers reveal the possibility of the connection between radiation emitted by the phones and variety of brain disorders. Correspondingly, the authors of the research emphasize on the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) which comes from the phone and the fact that beside the headache it might be the cause of the change of average [[Pure tone audiometry|pure tone audiometry (PTA)]] threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=S.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=S.|last3=Mahanta|first3=B.|date=October-December 2017|title=A study on the effect of prolonged mobile phone use on pure tone audiometry thresholds of medical students of Sikkim|url=|journal=Journal of Postgraduate Medicine|volume=63|pages=221-225|via=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ez-srv.rcbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Harmful effects of radiation at medical diagnostic centers ==
Dilshad Singh states that the use of the radio diagnostic is one of the main reasons of the rising amount of people with cancer. In addition, this researcher affirms that not only the patients are the ones being affected by radiation but also the medical personnel who are providing the diagnostic procedure. In his research Dilshad Singh also discloses that implementation of the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle should lower level of the radiation affects. However, the author declares that, according to the multiple investigation, protection techniques were not obeyed by the medical technicians, what might be the result of a lack of the radiation protection instruction courses as a part of the curriculum in the educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Dilshad|date=April-June 2017|title=Knowledge and Attitude of Medical Students Towards Radiation Exposure in Radiology Department|url=|journal=International Journal of Community Health &amp; Medical Research|volume=3|pages=15-20|via=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ez-srv.rcbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of the Wi-Fi and Li-Fi ==
[[File:Li-fi-usage.png|thumb|284x284px|the usage of the Li-fi ]]
Both [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Li-Fi]] can be used for the Personal digital assistant (PDA)  projects according to the Dr.S.Prabhavathi and undergraduate students Ms.Sai Kavya.C, Vijayalakshmi.K, Sreevani.K and Dilip.A in their research. However, because of the harmful influence of the radiation which is used by the Wi-Fi and can even worsen the conditions of [[physically impaired]] people, the  Li-Fi is implemented in the countries like India where the huge number of people are physically impaired. 

Furthermore, the use of Li-Fi is eco-friendly and low-cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prabhavathi|first=S.|last2=Sai Kavya|first2=C.|last3=Vijayalakshmi|first3=K.|last4=Sreevani|first4=K.|last5=Dilip|first5=A.|date=2018|title=PDA For Physically Impaired Using Li-Fi|url=|journal=International Journal of Recent Research Aspects.|volume=|pages=36-39|via=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ez-srv.rcbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of face-to-face and voice communication ==
Sherry Turkle in her essay "No Need to Call", by presenting the examples from real life situations, demonstrates the fact that text messaging have created the possibility to prevent people from the fast response and quick reaction to some particular question during the regular conversation, since a person gets more time to think about what should be answered. In addition, the presence of the other problem is described by the author in the part of an essay called "Voices": the gap created by e-mails and text messages between reality and virtual life leads to the fact that people can affirm that they are completely different character than they are in the real life, what is not that easy to do in real communication or even the voice call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="They say/I say": the moves that matter in academic writing, with readings|last=Graff|first=Gerald|last2=Birkenstein|first2=Cathy|last3=Durst|first3=Russel|publisher=W.W.Nornot &amp; Company, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=9780393937510|location=500 Fifth Avenue, New Year, N.Y. 10110|pages=374, 388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical help may in some instances be accompanied by [[embarrassment]].

==Features==
The source of this embarrassment or its range can vary from person to person. For some the embarrassment heightens when confronted by specific characteristics, such as a doctor of the opposite sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Partha|title=Transcultural Geriatrics: Caring for the Elderly of Indo-Asian Origin|date=2005|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for others, the scope of their embarrassment may be exhaustive regardless of the social or peer group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McVary|first1=Kevin|title=Contemporary Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction: A Clinical Guide|date=2010|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For others, the embarrassment factor may be overarching, especially when at a disadvantaged socioeconomic situation, for example one who needs financial assistance to obtain medical help.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Group Management Journal - Volumes 38-39 - Page 40, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In these scenarios the embarrassment may be duplicated due to a possible scenario wherein they are to be examined by both a doctor and perhaps if underage, a parent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robin|first1=Arthur|title=ADHD in Adolescents: Diagnosis and Treatment|date=1998|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if an adult of [[poverty|low socioeconomic circumstances]], perhaps a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Bessie|title=Social Work Supervision in Practice|date=2014|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hubbard Association of Scientologists''' ('''HAS''') was the original corporation founded in 1954 by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] that managed all [[Scientology]] organizations.  The HAS evolved from the Office of L. Ron Hubbard located in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. It was re-incorporated later in the year as the '''Hubbard Association of Scientologists International''' ('''HASI''') to correct the non-profit status omission in the corporate paperwork.

HASI general members would receive 10% discount on all books, tape lectures and other items from Church bookstores.  HASI membership was a requirement to take services at the various Scientology organizations.

HASI was the sole membership organization for the [[Church of Scientology]] prior to October 1984, when the [[International Association of Scientologists]] was started.

'''Indo-Guadeloupeans''' are mostly descended from indentured workers who came mostly from [[South India]] in the late 19th century.  There are currently about 60,000 people of Indian origin living in [[Guadeloupe]], making it home to one of the largest South Indian populations in the Caribbean.

==History==
Tamils in Guadeloupe trace their roots to over 40,000 indentured workers who were brought from [[India]] to [[Guadeloupe]] in 1861 to work on plantations through an agreement reached between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The importation of Indian labor was gradually discontinued after 1883 as a result of adoption of a policy by the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British Government]] against recruitment of labor in its territories and also because of the high mobility of Indian labor.

Over 10,000 of them perished as a result of difficult living and working conditions and the rest continued to be treated harshly until they secured some political rights in 1904 due to [[Henry Sidambarom]]'s efforts. It was in 1923 that Guadeloupeans of Indian descent were granted citizenship and the right to vote. A few Indians were indentured to [[Saint Martin]] (prior to 2007 Saint Martin was a part of Guadeloupe).

After migration stopped, the Indian community gradually acculturated to the rest of the population, so much so that few of the Indians on the island speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or other Indian languages any more. However, third or fourth generation [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|persons of Indian origin]] still maintain links with India in many different ways, such as adopting Indian names. Many Indians in Guadeloupe adopted French and Christian names.

==Current status==
The city of [[Basse-Terre]] in Guadeloupe and [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] in India have been designated as twin cities to promote cultural links and exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter19.pdf|format=PDF|title=People of other Central and South America countries|website=Indiandiaspora.nic.in|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian community in Guadeloupe is estimated to be approximately 55,000 in a population of over 400,000. However, ethnicity statistics are not done by the French government. There are several associations to promote [[Indian culture]] in Guadeloupe, usually run by people of Indian origin. They are fairly active in organising cultural activities in all the principal towns, namely, [[Pointe-à-Pitre|Pointe-a-Pitre]], [[Le Moule]], [[Port-Louis, Guadeloupe|Port-Louis]], [[Capesterre-Belle-Eau]] and [[Saint-Claude, Guadeloupe|Saint-Claude]].

One important Indian association is&amp;nbsp;''L‘Association Culturelle Guadeloupéenne des Amis de L’Inde'', which has over 300 members and 2000 associates.

There are a sizeable number of Hindu [[Tamil people|Tamil]] temples that are located in Basse-Terre, and other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesilesdeguadeloupe.com/2/5-touristic-offer-detail/1249000248-1249000106-gb-basse-terre/-1-1-1-1-basse-terre.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201025303/http://www.lesilesdeguadeloupe.com/2/5-touristic-offer-detail/1249000248-1249000106-gb-basse-terre/-1-1-1-1-basse-terre.htm |archivedate=2007-12-01 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamils]] in Guadeloupe started studying their own language in an effort to preserve their culture and traditions. Guadeloupe Tamils initiated links with [[Tamil Canadians]] in developing their language and culture.

The French principle of ''laicité'', meaning “secularism”, is practiced in Guadeloupe.  The French Republic forces Indian cultural associations to produce messages about Hinduism in Guadeloupe that display Indian culture independently from Hinduism.  However, it has proven to be controversial due to the French practice of ''laique,'' found in the second article of the French constitution which expresses the principle of separation between government affairs and religious institutions.  Indo-Guadeloupeans and Guadaloupean Hindus practice ''laicité'' freely in the public arena.  There is ongoing controversy since France is a ''laique'' state, thus religion is to be practiced privately. However, as French citizens, the only thorough enforcement has been to present religious tradition independent of their culture in their associative work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin-i-Pardo|first1=Meritxell|title=The Articulation of a French Civil Hinduism|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=878bcf96-1d8d-4a65-ba4c-0854c530efe8%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=33&amp;hid=113|website=ATLA|publisher=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the 152nd anniversary of the arrival of the Hindus Tamil in Guadeloupe was observed. The Indian Associations in the territory are in the process of forming a committee, which will start working to realize the event.

==Examples==
Some Indo-Guadeloupians have acceded to important posts in the public and private sectors. Dr. [[Henri Bangou]] held the post of Senator from Guadeloupe in the [[French Senate]]. [[Ernest Moutoussamy]] has been the Député of Guadeloupe in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indocaribbeanheritage.com/content/view/43/64/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709190845/http://www.indocaribbeanheritage.com/content/view/43/64/ |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kokborok''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Kokborok pron.ogg|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|v|ɔːr|oʊ|k}}) is the native language of the [[Borok people|Borok (Tripura) people]] of the Indian state of [[Tripura]] and neighbouring areas of [[Bangladesh]]. The name comes from ''kok'', meaning "language" and ''borok'', neaning "human", Kokborok is closely related to the [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dimasa language|Dimasa]] and [[Kachari language|Kachari]] languages of the neighbouring state of [[Assam]].

== History ==
Kokborok was formerly known as '''Tipra''', with its name being changed in the 20th century. The names also refers to the inhabitants of the former Twipra kingdom, as well as the ethnicity of its speakers.

In addition to Kokborok, the Tipra people speak three other languages: Tripura, [[Halam tribe|Riam chong]], and [[Darlong language|Darlong]] (and other related languages from Bangladesh and India). [[Halam tribe|Riam chong]] is spoken mostly by the Halam community and [[Darlong language]] spoken by the Darlong people, being related with [[Chin-Kuki-Mizo|Kuki-chin]] alike the [[Mizo]], while Kokborok is related to [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]. Kokborok and [[Halam tribe|Riam chong]] are very different from each other, but [[Halam tribe|Riam chong]] and [[Darlong language]] is also considered one of the native language of Tripura.

Kókborok has been attested since at least the 1st century AD, when the historical record of [[Borok people|Tipra]] kings began to be written down. The script of Kókborok was called "Koloma". The Chronicle of the [[Borok]] kings were written in a book called the ''Rajratnakar''. This book was originally written down in Kókborok using the Koloma script by Durlobendra [[Chontai]].

Later, two Brahmins, Sukreswar and Vaneswar translated it into Sanskrit and then again translated the chronicle into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in the 19th century. The chronicle of Tipra in Kókborok and Rajratnakar are no longer available. Kokborok was relegated to a common people's dialect during the rule of the [[Borok]] kings in the Kingdom of Tipra from the 19th century till the 20th century.

Kokborok was declared an official language of the state of [[Tripura]], India by the state government in the year 1979.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/north-east-india/tripura/in-tripura-a-musicians-bid-to-preserve-the-language-of-the-tribes/|title=In Tripura, a musician’s bid to preserve the language of the tribes|date=2018-05-22|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the language has been taught in schools of Tripura from the primary level to the higher secondary stage since the 1980s. A certificate course in Kokborok started from 1994 at [[Tripura University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripurauniv.in/index.php/departments?id=61|title=Tribal Language|last=User|first=Super|website=www.tripurauniv.in|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a post graduate diploma in Kokborok was started in 2001 by the Tripura University. Kokborok was introduced in the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in the colleges affiliated to the Tripura University from the year 2012, and a Masters of Arts (MA) degree in Kokborok was started by Tripura University from the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripurauniv.in/index.php/departments?id=400|title=Department of Kokborok|last=User|first=Super|website=www.tripurauniv.in|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a demand for giving the language recognition as one of the recognised official languages of India as per the 8th schedule of the Constitution. The official form is the dialect spoken in [[Agartala]], the state capital of Tripura.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Classification and related languages ==
Kokborok is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language of the [[Bodo–Garo languages|Bodo–Garo branch]].

It is closely related to the [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and [[Dimasa language|Dimasa]] languages of neighbouring [[Assam]]. The [[Garo language]] is also a related language spoken in neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] and the state of [[Meghalaya]].

Kókborok is not a single language but a collective name for the several languages and dialects spoken in Tripura. ''Ethnologue'' lists Usoi (Kau Brung), Riang (Polong-O), and Khagrachari ("Trippera") as separate languages; Mukchak (Barbakpur), though not listed, is also distinct, and the language of many Borok clans has not been investigated. The greatest variety is within Khagrachari, though speakers of different Khagrachari varieties can "often" understand each other. Khagrachari literature is being produced in the Naitong and Dendak varieties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.org/silesr/2011/silesr2011-038.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Debbarma Kókborok has the phonology of a typical Sino-Tibetan language.

=== Vowels ===
Kokborok has six vowel (monophthong) phonemes: /i u e w o a/.

Early scholars of Kokborok decided to use the letter '''w''' as a symbol for a vowel that does not exist in [[English language|English]]. In some localities, it is pronounced closer to i, and in others, it is pronounced closer to o.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacquesson |first=François |year=2003 |chapter=Kókborok, a short analysis |chapter-url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00008042/en/ |title=Hukumu, 10th anniversary volume |publisher=[[Kokborok Tei Hukumu Mission]] |pages=109-122 |oclc=801647829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kokborok spelling, '''u''' is used for the sound {{IPA|/w/}} in the diphthongs {{IPA|/wa/}} (used initially, spelled as '''ua''') and {{IPA|/wo/}} (used finally, spelled as '''uo'''). It is also used for the diphthong {{IPA|/ɔi/}} (spelled '''wi''') after '''m''' and '''p'''

&lt;!--This should be in an orthography section or something:

The consonants are b, d, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, ph, r, s, t, y along with combined consonants ch, kh, ph, th, ng.--&gt;

'''Ch''' is used for {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, while '''kh''', '''ph''', and '''th''' are used for {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} respectively.

'''N'''' is the pronunciation of the nasal sound; e.g., '''in'''' (''yes'').{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}

'''Ng''' is a digraph and is generally used in the last syllable of a word; e.g., '''aming''' (''cat''), '''holong''' (''stone'').

Ua is often used initially; e.g., '''uak''' (''pig''), '''uah''' (''bamboo''), '''uatwi''' (''rain'').

Uo is often used finally; e.g., '''thuo''' (''sleeping''), '''buo''' (''beat'').

=== Diphthongs ===
A [[diphthong]] is a group of two vowels. The '''wi''' diphthong is spoken as '''ui''' after sounds of the letters ''m'' and ''p''. Two examples are '''chumui''' (''cloud'') and '''thampui''' (''mosquito''). The '''ui''' diphthong is a variation of the '''wi''' diphthong. Other less frequent diphthongs, such as '''oi''' and '''ai''', are called closing diphthongs. A closing diphthong refers to a syllable that does not end in a consonant.

=== Syllables ===
Most words are formed by combining the root with an [[affix]]:
* '''kuchuk''' is formed from the root '''chuk''' (''to be high''), with the prefix, '''ku'''.
* '''phaidi''' (''come'') is formed from the root '''phai''' (''to come''), with the suffix '''di'''.

There are no Kókborok words beginning with '''ng'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kokborokorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kokborok-english-dictionary.pdf|title=Concise Kokborok-English-Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a syllable, any vowel except ''w'' can be found, along with a limited amount of consonants: ''p'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n'', ''ng'', ''r'' and ''l''. ''Y'' is found only in closing diphthongs like ''ai'' and ''wi''.

=== Clusters ===
"Clusters" are a group of consonants at the beginning of a syllable, like ''phl'', ''ph'' + ''l'', in '''phlat phlat''' (''very fast''), or ''sl'' in '''kungsluk kungsluk''' (''foolish man''). Clusters are quite impossible at the end of a syllable. There are some "false clusters" such as '''phran''' (''to dry'') which is actually '''phw-ran'''. These are very common in echo words : phlat phlat, phre phre, prai prai, prom prom, etc.

=== Tone ===
There are two tones in Kókborok: high tone and low tone. To mark the high tone, the letter ''h'' is written before the vowel with the high tone. These examples have low tone precedeing high tone to show that tone changes the meaning:
# ''lai'' easy ''laih'' crossed
# ''bor'' senseless ''bohr'' to plant
# ''cha'' correct ''chah'' to eat
# ''nukhung'' family ''nukhuhng'' roof

== Grammar ==
{{main article|Kokborok grammar}}

There is a clear cut difference between nouns and verbs. All true verbs are made with a verbal root followed by a number of suffixes, which are placed not randomly but according to definite rules.

==== Morphology ====
Morphologically Kókborok words can be divided into five categories. They are the following.

(a) '''Original words''': ''thang''-go; ''phai''-come; ''borok''-nation; ''borog-men'' ''kotor''-big; ''kuchu''-youngest; ''kwrwi''-not;etc.

(b) '''Compound words''', that is, words made of more than one original words: ''nai''-see; ''thok''-testy; ''naithok''-beautiful; ''mwtai''-god; ''nog''-house; ''tongthar''-temple; ''bwkha''-heart; ''bwkhakotor''-brave; etc.

(c) '''Words with suffixes''': ''swrwng''-learn; ''swrwngnai''-learner; ''nugjak''-seen; ''kaham''-good; ''hamya''- bad; etc.

(d) '''Naturalized loan words''': ''gerogo''-to roll; ''gwdna''-neck; ''tebil''- table; ''puitu''-faith; etc.

(e) '''Loan words''': ''kiching''-friend; etc.

== Numbers ==
Counting in Kókborok is called ''lekhamung''.

== Dialects ==
There are many Kókborok-speaking [[tribe]]s in the Indian states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]], [[Assam]], [[Mizoram]] and the neighbouring provinces of the country Bangladesh mainly in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. There are three main dialects which are not mutually intelligible, though the western dialect of the royal family, [[Debbarma]], is a [[prestige dialect]] understood by everyone. It is the standard for teaching and literature. It is taught as the medium of instruction up to class fifth and as subject up to graduate level. The other dialects are [[Jamatia]], Kalai and [[Noatia]].

== Literature ==
{{Main article|Kokborok literature}}

The first efforts of writing Kokborok were made by Radhamohan Thakur. He wrote the grammar of Kókborok named "Kókborokma" published in 1900, as well as two other books: "Tripur Kothamala" and "Tripur Bhasabidhan". Tripur Kothamala was the Kókborok-Bengali-English translation book published in 1906. The "Tripur Bhasabidhan" was published in 1907.

Daulot Ahmed was a contemporary of Radhamohan Thakur and was a pioneer of writing Kókborok Grammar jointly with Mohammad Omar. The Amar jantra, Comilla published his Kókborok grammar book "KOKBOKMA" in 1897.

On 27 December 1945 the "Tripura Janasiksha Samiti" came into being, and it established many schools in different areas of Tripura.

The first Kókborok magazine "Kwtal Kothoma" was edited and published in 1954 by Sudhanya Deb Barma, who was a founder of the Samiti. "Hachuk Khurio" (In the lap of Hills) by Sudhanya Deb Barma is the first modern Kókborok novel. It was published by the Kókborok Sahitya Sabha and Sanskriti Samsad in 1987. One major translation of the 20th century was the "Smai Kwtal", the New Testament of the Bible in Kókborok language, published in 1976 by the Bible Society of India.

The 21st century began for Kókborok literature with the monumental work, the Anglo-Kókborok-Bengali Dictionary compiled by Binoy Deb Barma and published in 2002 A.D. by the Kókborok tei Hukumu Mission. This is the 2nd edition of his previous ground breaking dictionary published in 1996 and is a trilingual dictionary. Twiprani Laihbuma (The Rajmala - History of Tripura) translated by R. K. Debbarma and published in 2002 by KOHM.

The full [[Holy Bible]] in Kokborok language was finally published for the first time in the year 2013 by the [[Bible Society of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tranzsend.org.nz/index.php/world-reach/773-2013-07-31-21-09-11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104092156/http://www.tranzsend.org.nz/index.php/world-reach/773-2013-07-31-21-09-11 |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baibel Kwthar]] is currently the largest work and biggest book published in the language with more than 1,300 pages and is now the benchmark for publications in the language.

The present trend of development of the Kókborok literary works show that Kókborok literature is moving forward slowly but steadily with its vivacity and distinctive originality to touch the rich literature of the rich languages.

== Institutions and organisations ==

Kók-borok has a script known as ''Koloma'', which is not in popular use. From the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Twipra]] used the [[Bengali script]] to write in Kók-borok, but since the independence of India and the merger with India, the Roman script is being promoted by non-governmental organisations. The Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) government made regulations in 1992 and 2000 for adoption of the Roman script in the school education system in its areas.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The script issue is highly politicised, with the [[Left Front (Tripura)|Left Front]] government advocating usage of the Asian Bengali script and all the regional indigenous parties and student organisations (INPT, IPFT, NCT, Twipra Students Federation, etc) and ethnic nationalist organisations (Kokborok Sahitya Sabha, Kokborok tei Hukumu Mission, Movement for Kokborok etc.) advocating for the Roman script.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Both scripts are now used in the state in education as well as in literary and cultural circles.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The [[official language]] of [[Gabon]] is [[French language|French]], while 32% of the people speak [[Fang language|Fang]] as a mother tongue.&lt;ref name="ulaval"&gt;

French is the medium of instruction. Before [[World War II]] very few Gabonese learned French, nearly all of them working in either business or government administration. After the war, France worked for universal primary education in Gabon, and by the 1960-61 census, 47% of the Gabonese over the age of 14 spoke some French, while 13% were literate in the language. By the 1990s, the literacy rate had risen to about 60%.

It is estimated that 80%&lt;ref name="2007_report"&gt;{{fr_icon}} [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2098821778 ''La Francophonie dans le monde 2006-2007''] published by the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]. [[Nathan (publisher)|Nathan]], [[Paris]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; of the country's population can speak the language competently and one-third of residents of [[Libreville]], the capital city, had become native French speakers.&lt;ref name = "ulaval"/&gt; More than 10,000 [[French people]] live in Gabon, and France predominates the country's foreign cultural and commercial influences. Outside the capital, French is less commonly spoken, though it is used by those who have completed a secondary or university education.

The indigenous languages are all members of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] family, estimated to have come to Gabon about 2,000 years ago, and differentiated into about 40 languages. They are generally spoken but not written; while missionaries from the [[United States]] and France developed transcriptions for a number of languages based on the [[Latin alphabet]] starting in the 1840s, and translated the [[Bible]] into several of them, French colonial policy officially promoted the study of French and discouraged African languages. The languages continue to be transmitted through family and clan, and individuals in cities and other areas where different people may learn several Bantu languages.

The Gabonese government sponsored research on the Bantu languages starting in the 1970s.

The three largest languages are [[Fang language|Fang]], [[Mbere language|Mbere]], and [[Sira language|Sira]] (Eshira), each with about 25–30% of the speakers. The remainder of the languages are single-digit percentages, and some have only a few thousand speakers.

Education for the deaf in Gabon uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]].  (See [[Francophone African Sign Language]].)

In October 2012, just before the 14th summit of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], the country declared an intention to add English as a second official language, reportedly in response to an investigation by France into corruption in the African country.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/frosty-relations-with-hollande-see-gabon-break-the-french-connection-8202897.html|title=Frosty relations with Hollande see Gabon break the French connection|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=9 October 2012|first=Alex|last=Duval Smith|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the spokesman for [[Ali Bongo Ondimba]] said: ""You know very well that once you leave the Francophonie space, if you do not speak English, you are almost handicapped. What is most interesting in the issue is the realization that French writers publish some of their materials in English, and that during international conferences, the French diplomats speak in English. If the French themselves are moving toward English, why would anyone expect the Gabonese not to?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-10/03/c_131886754.htm|title=Gabon to introduce English as second official language|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116083430/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-10/03/c_131886754.htm|archivedate=16 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later clarified that the country intended to introduce English as a first foreign language in schools, while keeping French as the general medium of instruction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''Musa Khel''', or '''Moosa Khel''', is a [[Pashtun tribe]] of [[Gharghasht]] origin. According to [[Horace Arthur Rose]] and the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, they are part of the greater [[Kakar]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Harold Arthur|title=Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North West Frontier Province|date=1911|publisher=Asian Educational Services, India|isbn=978-8120605053|page=438|edition=Facsimile edition 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Musa Khel |volume=19 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe originates from [[Ghazni province]] in [[Afghanistan]] and resides in the tribal range of [[Musakhel District, Pakistan|Musakhel]] and [[Batagram District]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]] and Afghanistan. Moosa Khel has the lowest literacy rate in Pakistan&amp;mdash;10.37%&amp;mdash;and is also a sub-tribe to Babozai, which is part of the major [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribe. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1467">'''Nicole Estienne''' (c.1542-c.1588) was a [[French people|French]] poet of the [[Renaissance]].

==Life and work==
Her parents were [[Charles Estienne]] and Geneviève de Berly. Her father's family was influential in the printing business.

The writer [[Jacques Grévin]] became engaged to her and celebrated her in his collection ''L'Olimpe''. The engagement was broken for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Robin, Larsen and Levin, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nicole then married [[Jean Liebault]], a physician from [[Dijon]].

She wrote several works, some of which have survived. In response to Philippe Desportes's misogynist writings, she defended women in her ''Stanzes''. Her best known work is ''Les Misères de la Femme mariée, où se peuvent voir les peines et tourmens qu’elle reçoit durant sa vie'', in which she condemned big age differences between spouses and domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Robin, Larsen and Levin, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of her poems were written as introductions to the work of other poets.

'''Padrino system''', or ''[[Political patronage#Politics|patronage]]'' in the [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino culture]] and [[Politics of the Philippines|politics]] is the value system where one gains favor, [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]], or political appointment through family affiliation ([[nepotism]]) or friendship ([[cronyism]]), as opposed to one's [[Meritocracy|merit]].  The ''Padrino System'' in the Philippines has been the source of many controversies and [[Political corruption|corruption]].

It has been an [[open secret]] that one cannot join the [[Politics of the Philippines|political arena of the Philippines]] without mastery of the Padrino System.  From the lowest [[Barangay]] official, to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic]], it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one's career or influence, if not wealth.

==Patronage in the Executive==
The Padrino system sometimes exists in Executive, due to the leader's allegiance to his or her party, supporters and contributors.

==Patronage in the Legislative==
The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] in many ways has laid down the foundations against nepotism, cronyism, and [[Oligarchy|oligarchial]] rule of the few.  As a [[democratic republic]], the Philippines is supposed to have a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  However, in reality, one can take a look at the [[Congress of the Philippines|Legislative Branch of the government]], and come to a conclusion that it is all on the contrary.

The issue of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] has always been touched, especially during elections, but the subject has been much avoided by politicians alike who have a wife, son, daughter, or a relative sitting in office as well.

In September 2008, Sen. [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] passed Senate Bill No. 2616, or the "'''Anti-Political Recommendation Act'''," however this as usual has been shelved for the time being and is currently pending at the Committee level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=14&amp;q=SBN-2616 Senate Bill No. 2616, Anti-Political Recommendation Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[pork barrel scam]] broke out, Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] claimed that Pres. [[Benigno Aquino III]] used the [[Disbursement Acceleration Program]] to influence the 188 Congressional Representatives and 20 Senators to approve the [[Impeachment of Renato Corona|impeachment complaint]] against [[Renato Corona]]. On July 2, 2014 the Supreme Court decision on DAP was ruled as unconstitutional.

==Patronage in the Military==
The [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) was known as one of the best in the post-World War geopolitical scene in Southeast Asia, if not the whole of Asia.  Majority of the officers were graduates from the [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]-styled [[Philippine Military Academy]] - which is also considered as Asia's best [[military academy]].

In order to get a higher rank or office,you must have at least known or befriend a high-ranking official to be promoted.

==Padrino System in Society==

==Impact==

This kind of system affect an individual with higher intellect by kicking them out by giving undeserved chance to those close to ones with high position usually in business and politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9083">'''Population momentum''' is a typical consequence of the demographic transition.  Even if a high-fertility, high-growth population experiences an immediate drop in fertility to [[replacement rate]], that population will continue to grow for several decades.  Eventually, because the new fertility rate is replacement, the population achieves equilibrium at some new level.  Population momentum is defined as the ratio of the size of the population at that new equilibrium level to the size of the initial population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Population momentum usually occurs in populations that are growing.

== Example ==

Assume that a population has three generations: First (oldest), Second (child bearing), and Third (children).  Further assume that this population has a fertility rate equal to four (4).  That is, each generation is twice the size of the previous.  If the population of the first generation is arbitrarily set at 100, the second is then 200, and the third is 400.  The spreadsheet below shows the initial population in the first row.

|Population: 1200

|}

First note that the second and third generation of the initial population are each twice the size of the previous.  The total of the initial population is 700 = 100 + 200 + 400.

Then assume that at the end of the third generation, fertility falls to replacement (for simplicity assume that to be two). Now take the population forward in time to the next generation, line two of the spreadsheet. The first generation dies, and the new generation, the fourth, is equal to the third (because now fertility is replacement).  Repeat the process again to reach the fifth generation (line 3 in the spreadsheet). The fifth generation is again equal to the fourth and now the population’s three generations are equal, and the population has reached equilibrium.

The initial population has grown from 700 to 1,200 even though fertility dropped from four to replacement (two) at the end of the third generation.  Population momentum carried the population to higher levels over the next two generations.

== Further steps to zero population growth ==

Population momentum impacts the immediate birth and [[death rates]] in the population that determine the natural rate of growth. However, for the a population to have an absolute zero amount of natural growth, the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health suggests that three things must occur.

1. Fertility rates must level off to the [[replacement rate]] (the [[net reproduction rate]] should be 1). If the fertility rate remains higher than the replacement rate, the population would continue to grow.

2. [[Mortality rate]] must stop declining, that is, it must remain constant.

3. Lastly, the age structure must adjust to the new rates of fertility and mortality. This last step takes the longest to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bongaarts|first=John|date=|year=2009|title=Human population growth and the demographic transition|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=364|issue=1532|pages=2985–2990|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0137|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2781829|pmid=19770150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of Population Momentum ==
Population momentum has implications for population policy for a number of reasons.

1. With respect to high-fertility countries (for example in the [[developing world]]), a positive population momentum, meaning that the population is increasing, states that these countries will continue to grow despite large and rapid declines in fertility.

2. With respect to [[Total fertility rate|lowest-low fertility]] countries (for example in [[Europe]]), a negative population momentum implies that these countries may experience population decline even if they try to increase their rate of fertility to the replacement rate of 2.1. For example, some [[Eastern European]] countries show a population shrinkage even if their birth rates recovered to replacement level. Population momentum can become negative if the fertility rate is under replacement level for a long period of time.

3. Population momentum shows that replacement level fertility is a long-term concept rather than an indication of current population growth rates. Depending on the extant age structure, a fertility rate of two children per woman may correspond to short-term growth or decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/Files/PopFacts_2017-4_Population-Momentum.pdf|title=The impact of population momentum on future population growth|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=United Nations Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Another implication of population momentum is its effect on the labor force; more specifically the distribution of the labor force[1]. We established earlier that population momentum occurs when a population continues to grow despite the replacement fertility level being met. Meaning that there are more children being born. When there are more children being birthed for that time being until the child is able to work they become dependents meaning that they don't do much to "contribute" to their society. Which leads to an unfavorabale dependency ratio. When the children reach the age to work that countries dependency ratio will change and become favorable.

==Calculation==
[[File:Population pyramid of India 2015.png|thumb|[[Demographics of India|Population pyramid of India]] showing the beginning of  population momentum even though their birth rates have been declining since 1955]]
To calculate population momentum for population A, a theoretical population is constructed in which the [[birth rate]] for population A immediately becomes replacement level. Under such conditions, the population will eventually stabilize into a stationary population, with no year-to-year changes in age-specific rates or in total population. The population momentum is calculated by dividing this final total population number by the starting population.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Heuveline, and Guillot (2001) Demography: Measuring and Modeling Population Processes, 165&lt;/ref&gt; Momentum, Ω, can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\Omega=(be_o)Q&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''b'' is the crude birth rate while ''e&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the life expectancy at birth. ''Q'' is the total number of births per initial birth.

[[File:Aztec Pāmitl in Ramírez Codex.png|thumb|An Aztec man holding a Pāmitl as drawn by [[Juan de Tovar]] in the [[Ramírez Codex]]]]
'''Pāmitl''' was the Aztec name for a flag or banner containing identifying emblems of officers and prestigious warriors. These have been recorded to have been carried in the hands or more commonly worn on the back in a similar manner to the Japanese [[uma-jirushi]].  Each of the Pāmitl is brightly decorated, lightweight, and unique.  These features allowed officers better control of their troops on the battlefield while not hampering the combat abilities of the soldier.&lt;ref&gt;John Pohl &amp; Charles Robinson III, ''Aztecs and conquistadores. The Spanish Invasion &amp; the Collapse of the Aztec Empire'', Osprey publishing Ltd, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to much of the other clothing of the nobility of the Aztecs, Pāmitl were most likely made out of a woven cotton with feathers on top of the cotton backing. They were often formed to resemble an animal or religious symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Aztec Warrior: AD 1325–1521&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12331">In [[political science]] and [[international relations]] theory, a '''rentier state''' is a [[state (polity)|state]] which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the [[economic rent|rent]] of indigenous resources to external clients. This theory was first postulated by Hossein Mahdavy in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Mahdavy, "The Pattern and Problems of Economic Development in Rentier States: The Case of Iran", in ''Studies in the Economic History of the Middle East'', ed. M.A. Cook (Oxford University Press, Oxford 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in this article that the concept of ''external rent'' was first introduced.

Mahdavy's usage of the term is in stark contrast to how the term was originally used by Marxists. [[Lenin]] wrote in 1916: ''For that reason the term “rentier state” (Rentnerstaat), or usurer state, is coming into common use in the economic literature that deals with imperialism. The world has become divided into a handful of usurer states and a vast majority of debtor states. (...)''&lt;ref&gt;Lenin. [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch08.htm "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (chapter VIII)"], Retrieved on 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the  [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], a rentier state ''enriches itself by exporting capital to other states, primarily those that are economically underdeveloped and dependent.'' &lt;ref&gt;Great Soviet Encyclopedia. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Rentier+State], The Free Dictionary, Retrieved on 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This is better known in English as [[Rentier capitalism]].

== Usage ==

The term ''rentier state'' has been used since the 20th century. It is most frequently applied to states rich in highly valued [[natural resources]] such as petroleum but can also include states rich in financial instruments such as a [[reserve currency]]. It can also be applied to nations which trade on their strategic resources, such as an important [[military base]].

Dependent upon it as a source of income, rentier states may generate rents externally by manipulating the global political and economic environment. Such manipulation may include [[monopolies]], trading restrictions, and the solicitation of [[subsidies]] or [[aid]] in exchange for political influence or conversely the solicitation of loans in exchange for the reserve currency, e.g., the United States.

== Formal definition ==

[[Hazem Al Beblawi]] and [[Giacomo Luciani]] suggested four characteristics of a rentier state:

* Rent situations predominate.
* The economy relies on a substantial external rent – and therefore does not require a strong domestic productive sector.
* Only a small proportion of the working population is actually involved in the generation of the rent.
* Perhaps most importantly, the state’s government is the principal recipient of the external rent.&lt;ref name="Beblawi87-88"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Luciani, Giacomo, 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge, p. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The emergence of the new oil states and their increasing importance in [[International trade|world trade]] in the 1970s brought a renewed interest in thinking on rentier economies in the aforementioned disciplines of [[political science]] and [[international relations]].&lt;ref name="Beblawi" /&gt; Examples of rentier states include oil-producing countries in the [[MENA]] region including [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] as well as a few states in Latin America, all of whom are members of [[OPEC]].&lt;ref name="Beblawi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, L., 1987, "The State in the Middle East North Africa," ''Comparative Politics'', Volume 20, Issue 1, Pages 1–18&lt;/ref&gt; African states such as [[Nigeria]], [[Gabon]], [[Angola]], [[Ghana]], [[Uganda]] and [[South Sudan]] are also important oil producers with rentier economies, earning income from trading natural resources.

Rentier state theory has been one of several advanced to explain the predominance of authoritarian [[regime]]s in the Middle East and the apparent lack of success of [[Democracy in the Middle East|democracy in the region]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., 2004, Oil Wealth &amp; Regime Survival in the Developing World: 1960–1999, ''American Journal of Political Science'', Volume 48, Issue 2, Pages 232–246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;Abulof, Uriel (2015).
[http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jird/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/jird201432a.html "Can’t Buy Me Legitimacy": The Elusive and Illusive Stability of Mideast Rentier Regimes]. ''Journal of International Relations and Development''.&lt;/ref&gt; While many states export resources or license their development by foreign parties, rentier states are characterized by the relative absence of revenue from domestic taxation, as their naturally occurring wealth precludes the need to extract income from their citizenry. According to Douglas Yates,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semp.us/biots/biot_227.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029103149/http://www.semp.us/biots/biot_227.html |date=October 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the economic behavior of a rentier state
&lt;blockquote&gt;embodies a break in the work-reward causation ... [r]ewards of income and wealth for the rentier do not come as the result of work but rather are the result of chance or situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hazem Beblawi and Giacomo Luciani have argued that this could create a "rentier mentality,"&lt;ref name="Beblawi87-88" /&gt; while political scientist [[Fareed Zakaria]] has posited that such states fail to develop politically because, in the absence of taxes, citizens have less incentive to place pressure on the government to become responsive to their needs. Instead, the government essentially 'bribes' the citizenry with extensive social welfare programs, becoming an ''allocation'' or ''distributive state''.  The budget, in effect, is little more than an expenditure programme.&lt;ref name="Beblawi90"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Luciani, Giacomo, 1990, "The Rentier State in the Arab World," in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been theorized that governments that rely to a significant extent on revenues from non-market sources are not compelled to apply free market principles to create an environment conducive to economic growth. Oil is in such demand that it does not require adherence to free market principles and economic freedom based on rule of law, security, a fair and transparent judiciary and property rights. As a consequence, political freedom does not develop and efforts aimed at [[democratization]] are undermined.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Moreover, because control of the rent-producing resources is concentrated in the hands of the authorities, it may be used to alternately coerce or coopt their populace, while the distinction between public service and private interest becomes increasingly blurred.&lt;ref name="Beblawi91"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Luciani, Giacomo, 1990, "The Rentier State in the Arab World," in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; There is, in the words of [[Noah Feldman]] in his book ''After Jihad'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;no fiscal connection between the government and the people. The government has only to keep its people in line so that they do not overthrow it and start collecting the oil rents themselves. (Feldman 139)&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, N., (2003). ''After Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy'', New York, Farrar, Straus and Giroux&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Consequently, in these resource-rich rentier states there is a challenge to developing [[civil society]] and [[democratization]]. Hence, theorists such as Beblawi and Luciani conclude that the nature of rentier states provides a particular explanation for the presence of authoritarian regimes in such resource rich states.&lt;ref name="Beblawi"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Giacomo Luciani, 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Beblawi and Luciani identify several other characteristics particularly associated with rentier oil states. For example, where the government is the largest and ultimate employer, the [[bureaucracy]] is frequently bloated and inefficient – and indeed comes to resemble a rentier class in society.  Moreover, local laws often make it impossible for foreign companies to operate independently. This leads to a situation where citizenship becomes a financial asset. To do business, foreign enterprises engage a local sponsor (''kafil'') who allows the company to trade in his name in return for a proportion of the proceeds – another type of rent. In addition, the oil rent leads to secondary rents, usually stock market or real estate speculation.&lt;ref name="Beblawi92"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Luciani, Giacomo, 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Rentier state theory foregrounds important puzzles in contemporary politics. For example, as Abulof asks, “If rents increase regime stability, especially authoritarian durability, why, then, are rentier regimes, particularly in authoritarian petro-states, more prone to civil wars?” Looking at the Middle East, “why have certain rentier states (such as Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) remained so remarkably stable, while others (such as Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Libya and Sudan) have become—either before or during the Arab Spring—scenes of violent unrest?” Abulof points to political legitimacy is a determining factor, and argues that authoritarian rentier regimes are in fact more fragile than they seem to be.&lt;ref name="Abulof" /&gt;

The crucial nature of oil has led to a situation where non-oil states have started to behave like rentier states.  This can be seen for the region as a whole – so some states have been able to exploit location rent due to their strategic location, for example, as sites for military bases. More significantly, inter-state relations in the region have been affected as oil states try to ensure stability and tranquillity for their rent by buying allegiance from neighbouring states – in effect, sharing the oil rent.  Beblawi and Luciani highlight the case of Egypt whose receipt of financial aid from oil-rich neighbours declined significantly after [[Camp David Accords|Camp David]], and money going instead to Iraq, Syria and the PLO who were considered more assertive.&lt;ref name="Beblawi96"&gt;Beblawi, Hazem Al and Luciani, Giacomo, 1990, The Rentier State in the Arab World, in Luciani, G., ''The Arab State'', London, Routledge, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, scholars have tied rentier theory to the process of disenfranchisement and ultimately radicalization, posing that the breakdown of the citizen-state relationship can ultimately foster non-economically motivated radicalism. This is particularly important, given the geographic positioning of today's rentier states.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''Russian lacquer art''' developed from the art of [[Russian icons|icon]] painting which came to an end with the collapse of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. The icon painters, who previously had been employed by supplying not only churches but people's homes, needed a way to make a living. Thus, the craft of making [[papier-mâché]] decorative boxes and panels developed, the items were [[lacquer]]ed and then hand painted by the artists, often with scenes from folk tales.

==The four centers of Russian lacquer art==
The village of [[Fedoskino miniature|Fedoskino]] (Федоскино)[http://www.instaplanet.com/fedoskino.html], located not far from [[Moscow]] on the banks of the [[Ucha River]], is the oldest of the four art centers of Russian lacquer miniature painting on [[papier-mâché]], which has been practiced there since 1795. It stands apart both geographically, and in that that oil paints are used rather than [[egg tempera]]. While allowing the artist a free hand in [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] interpretation, the style of Fedoskino painting is largely realistic in composition and detail.

The other three Russian lacquer art centers are:
*[[Palekh miniature|Palekh]] (Палех)
*[[Kholuy miniature|Kholuy]] (Kholuy, Kholuj, Holui - Холуй)
*[[Mstyora miniature|Mstyora]] (Мстёра)

The lacquer artists of Palekh, Kholui and Mstera continue to use the technique of painting in egg-based tempera overlaid with intricate gold leaf highlighting.''

All three are situated in the [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] Principality, Ivanovo region of central [[Russia]], and are deeply rooted in the 17th-19th century [[icon]] painting tradition, which lasted until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and is now being revived by young artists of the 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">The '''Sai''' or sometimes pronounced Sayee are a [[Muslim]] community found in the states of [[Bihar]] and  [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are also known as the Sain.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1237 to 1239 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Sai are one of a number of Muslim mendicant communities traditionally connected with begging at [[Sufi]] shrines in [[North India]]. They are also involved in the manufacture of tazias for the [[Muharram]] festival, as well as grave digging. Very little is known about their origin, and they could have evolved from a number of different communities who took up the profession of begging and grave digging. The Sai are found mainly in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]. They speak the [[Awadhi]] dialect, and much in common with the [[Jogi Faqir]], another [[Muslim]] mendicant community. Most Sai claim to be of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] status.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1237 to 1239 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sayee of [[Bihar]] claim to belong to the [[Shaikh Siddiqui]] community, and claim descent from [[Abu Bakar]], the first [[caliph]] of [[Islam]]. Like other [[Muslim]] communities of [[Bihar]], they date their origin to the time of [[Bakhtiyar Khilji]], the [[Muslim]] conqueror of Bihar. They have several sub-divisions, the main ones being the Madari, Rafai, Jalali, Mewati and Sada-Sohgal. They are found mainly in [[Patna]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Nalanda]] and [[Muzaffarpur]] districts. The Sayee speak [[Urdu]], with most understanding [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 867 to 869 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Sai shah fakir are endogamous, marrying within close kin. Their traditional occupation was takyadar
, but over time a small number have acquired land, much of gifted by the other communities because of their supposed sanctity. A good many are now marginal farmers or sharecroppers. The urban Sai have remained involved in their traditional occupation of begging and grave digging. A small number of Sai are now village [[mullah]]s as well. The community are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, and fairly orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1237 to 1239 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Sayee in [[Bihar]] are landless, with many still engaged in their traditional occupation of begging.  In some parts of Rajasthan, Sayee are called  Banwa   or  Jhunjhunwati Sayee and they are involved in singing and the band owner profession. A good many are landless agricultural labourers, while some have acquired some land. Like their [[Uttar Pradesh]] counterparts, some Sai are now employed as village [[mullah]]s.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 867 to 869 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satawalese''' is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. It is nearly intelligible with [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese]].&lt;!-- Kylee Nihipali
Satawalese Language Research Portfolio --&gt;

==Introduction==

===History===
Satawalese is a language spoken on the island of [[Satawal]], located in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].  The language is also spoken in [[Yap]] State, nearby atolls and islands such as [[Lamotrek]], [[Woleai]], [[Poluwat|Puluwat]], [[Pulusuk]], and [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] State.  Smaller populations of speakers can also be found in [[Saipan]], the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], and some parts of the [[United States]].  According to a 1987 census, Satawalese is spoken by approximately 460 people however this number has grown, according to a count taken by researcher Kevin Roddy who reported for about 700 speakers in 2007.

===Classification===
Satawalese is identified as an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language and is a member of the [[Trukic languages|Truukic]] language subgroup.  Discovered by scholar Edward Quackenbush, the Truukic subgroup is a [[dialect]] chain composed of a variety of about 17 different languages and dialects extending 2,100 kilometers across the western Pacific (Roddy, 2007).  This chain begins at Chuuk in the east and stretches towards [[Sonsorol]] in the west.  In the center of this dialect continuum lies Satawalese.  Using the comparative method, which involves the observation of vocabulary and sound correspondence similarities, linguists were able to link Satawalese as well as its sister languages to the Trukic language family.  Sister languages of Satawalese include [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]], [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]], [[Mapia language|Mapia]], [[Mortlockese]], [[Namonuito language|Namonuito]], [[Pááfang language|Paafang]], [[Puluwatese language|Puluwatese]], [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorol]], [[Tanapag]], [[Tobian]], [[Ulithian]], and [[Woleaian]].

==Sounds==

===Consonants===
Satawalese language contains 13 specific consonants. /p/, /f/, /m/, /w/, /n/, /t/, /s/, /r/, /j/, /k/, /t͡ʃ/, /ŋ/, /ɻ/

The existence of the [[phoneme]] {{IPAslink|g}} is debated in Satawalese.  Some scholars believe the phoneme to be an allophone of the phoneme {{IPAslink|k}}.  It is suggested that in Satawalese language both phonemes can be interchanged without changing the meaning of a word.  Opposing studies suggest {{IPA|/g/}} to be its own separate phoneme. Because of evidence that shows use of {{IPA|/g/}} on its own within Satawalese speech, the suggestion that it is its own phoneme has a stronger stance.

The phoneme {{IPAslink|l}} in Satawalese has been identified as an allophone for the phoneme {{IPAslink|n}} due to influence of surrounding languages.  {{IPA|/l/}} is not included in the Satawalese phoneme inventory but is a part of similar languages close in proximity.  This phone is understood to convey the same meanings that phoneme {{IPA|/n/}} will produce but in surrounding languages there are cases where roles cannot be reversed; {{IPA|/l/}} will be able to take the place of {{IPA|/n/}} but {{IPA|/n/}} cannot take the place of {{IPA|/l/}}.

===Vowels===
Satawalese contains nine vowels:/i/, /a/, /o/, /u/, /æ/, /ɛ/, /ʉ/, /ɞ/, /ɒ/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roddy|first1=Kevin|title=A sketch grammar of Satawalese, the language of Satawal Island, Yap State, Micronesia|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/20678/M.A.CB5.H3_3421_r.pdf?sequence=2|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2014}}{{dubious|date=May 2014}}

==Grammar==

===Basic word order===
Satawalese use Subject-Object-Verb word order.

Ex:
Mary a foato-ki tinikii we aan “Mary wrote her letter.”

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is available in the Satawalese language.  It is used mainly to show a progressive form of a verb, noun, or adjective.

Ex
*‘’ras’’ vt. to pull something until it breaks. 
*‘’rasras’’ vt. progressive form of ras; the continuous pulling of something until it breaks
*‘’rig’’ adj. small.
*‘’rigrig’’ adj. progressive form of rig; smaller.
*‘’seo’’ rested.
*‘’seoseo’’ v. resting.
*‘’pis’’ n. splash. 
*‘’pisipis’’ adj. progressive form of pis; 'splashing around'.

===Numerals===
Like most Pacific languages as well as many languages around the world, Satawalese takes advantage of a [[base ten counting system]]. The Satawalese language contains two basic counting systems (Roddy, 2007).  One system is the fast version, which is the version used for counting objects as well as game playing.  The second counting system in Satawal is the slow version.  This system is used when teaching young children the numeral system, and is also used by older generations.
	
Slow version		Fast version		English translation
*‘’Eota’’ *‘’Eot’’ one
*‘’Riuwa’’ *‘’Riuw’’ two
*‘’Eoniu’’  *‘’Eon’’three
*‘’Faeni’’ *‘’Faen’’four
*‘’Nima’’ *‘’Nim’’five
*‘’Wona’’ *‘’On’’ six
*‘’Fiusa’’ *‘’Fius’’seven
*‘’Waani’’ *‘’Wan’’ eight
*‘’Tiwa*‘’Tiw’’nine

Large numbers are also existent in the Satawalese language.  All numbers greater than ten are produced by using the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] ''me'', which translates to the word “and” in English.  For example, the numeral eleven is ''seig me ew'', which translates to “ten and one” in English or eleven.  One billion is the largest numeral in the Satawalese language.  It is expressed as ''engeras ssen'' or ''one thousand million''.

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous vocabulary===
*''Saam''  –father
*''rheon''  –leaf
*''pwun''  –heart
*''oattoaur''  –to eat (polite form)
*''moat''  –to sit

===Loanwords===
Satawalese has borrowed words from major language countries that had traveled throughout the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] such as [[Japanese language|Japan]], [[Spanish language|Spain]], and the [[American English|United States]], as well as nearby languages within the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], such as [[Woleaian language|Woleaian]] and [[Ulithian language|Ulithian]].

Words derived from [[English language|English]]:
	
*''aispwoax'' – Ice box; refrigerator
*''felowa'' - bread; flour
*''finoras'' – flowers
*''frii'' – free
*''friiseor'' – freezer
*''karesiin'' – kerosene

Words derived from [[Ulithian language|Ulithian]]:

*''aasi'' – to take (it)
*''aaileng'' – world
*''fiifi'' – soup
*''kaerboaw'' – cow

Words derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:
	
*''floras'' – flowers									
*''kanemasa'' – pumpkin

Words derived from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:
	
*‘’kanepwas'' – calabash
*''kachito'' – movie

Words derived from [[Woleaian language|Woleaian]]:
	
*''gamaeinoak'' – pretend
*''faisun'' – as it is
*" ngang"- Me
*"Ito-come

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
Satawalese language resources have become quite abundant in the past decade.  Alphabet books, translations, as well as dictionaries are all available in the Satawalese language.  Also linguistic studies have been documented sharing the language’s grammar, phonology, vocabulary, stories, etc.

===Vitality===
According to endangeredlanguages.com Satawalese is classified as an [[endangered language]].  However, the language Satawalese shows lots of promise for the future. Satawalese is spoken as an L1 by most of the population occupying the island of Satawal.  It is also used throughout the Federated States of Micronesia as well as nearby states. Also, according to David Roddy the population of Satawalese speakers has grown to 700 in an accounting taken in 2007.  Awareness of the island has been a current enhancement to the language due to the contributions made of voyager Mau Piailug who was known to have been the first navigator aboard the ship of the infamous Hawaiian double-hulled canoe the [[Hokulea]].  With this discovery, interest in the island including the people, culture, and language have been uprooted, meaning more linguistic studies can be done, possibly more resources can be added, and so on.  Finally, the Satawalese language documentation is outstanding.  As stated before dictionaries and alphabet books have been created allowing the transmission of the language to occur between older and younger generations.

==History==
{{Main article|History of the Serbs|History of Montenegro}}

Following the Slavic(Serb and Croat) settlement of the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries, several principalities were established in the Western Balkans towards the Adriatic. [[Duklja]], first mentioned in the ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' ({{circa}} 960), was one of the Serbian principalities that came under Byzantine rule in 1018 after [[Basil II]]'s conquest of Bulgaria. The Serbs were the Empire's "most important but insubodinate subjects in the western Balkans". Duklja broke away from Byzantine rule in 1042 under ruler [[Stefan Vojislav]] and became the leading Serbian state until the 12th century. All of what is today Montenegro came under the rule of Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], after 1180. [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]], formerly known as Duklja, became a less important region in the Serbian state.&lt;ref name="LuscombeRiley-Smith2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Luscombe|author2=Jonathan Riley-Smith|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 4, C.1024-c.1198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUl53tLtFukC&amp;pg=PA266|date=14 October 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41411-1|pages=266–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it remained a crown land, given to the heir of the monarch. Several monasteries date to this period, such as: [[Praskvica Monastery|Praskvica]], [[Banja Monastery|Banja]], [[Morača (monastery)|Morača]], [[Vranjina Monastery|Vranjina]], and others.

Montenegro saw independence under the [[Petrović-Njegoš dynasty]], firstly as a principality and then as a kingdom. Both Kingdoms fought together as independent states in the [[Balkan Wars]] and in the First World War. At the end of the war in 1918 tensions arose between the two states as the Montenegrin Whites with Serbian support deposed [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] and proclaimed Montenegro's unification with Serbia as part of [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929), while the [[Montenegrin Greens]] opposed it. The conflict led to the [[Christmas Uprising]], in which the Whites with support from the Serbian army defeated the Greens.&lt;ref name="Banač1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banač|first=Ivo|title=The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=March 1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9493-2|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the monarchic Yugoslavia, ruled by the Serbian [[Karađorđević dynasty]], the tensions between Serbs and Croats were increasing and most of the Montenegrin politicians supported the Serbian proposed centralised state.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Balkans 1265.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] from 1217 to 1346, led by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]]]

During the Second World War both Serbs and Montenegrins were very active in both resistance movements, the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and the [[Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland]] known as the [[Chetniks]]. At the end of the war the [[SFR Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]] was created and the two became republics within the Yugoslav federation.

Yugoslav Partisan Milovan Djilas described himself as a Montenegrin Serb and described Montenegro as the spiritual homeland of Serbs, saying "I am not a Montenegrin because I am a Serb, but a Serb because I am a Montenegrin. We Montenegrins are the salt of the Serbs. All the strength of the Serbs is not here [in Montenegro] but their soul is."&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Roberts 2007. Pp. 1"&gt;Elizabeth Roberts. Realm of the Black Mountain: A History of Montenegro. London, England, UK: Cornell University Press, 2007. Pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Djilas also has said "The Montenegrins are, despite provincial and historical differences, quintessentially Serbs, and Montenegro the cradle of Serbian myths and of aspirations for the unification of Serbs.".&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Roberts 2007. Pp. 1"/&gt;

After the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia in 1991 and 1992, [[SR Montenegro]] held the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|Montenegrin referendum in 1992]] which ended with a 95.96% of votes in favour for a state union with [[Serbia]] and with the changing of the socialist political system towards a multi-party one. The country was renamed [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In this period between 1990 and 1998 Montenegro was ruled by [[Momir Bulatović]] who had close relations with the Serbian president [[Slobodan Milošević]] and who was very supportive to keep close ties between the two republics within the state union. Montenegro was also included by the economic sanctions imposed to Serbia during the 1990s. During the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] both Serbia and Montenegro suffered the attacks of the NATO forces and several targets inside Montenegro were also bombarded. All this contributed to the rise in power in Montenegro of [[Milo Đukanović]] who was known to be much less sympathetic towards the Serbo-Montenegrin ties and would become an open supporter of the independence of Montenegro. In 2006, six years after the fall of Milošević in 2000, and after insisting on international diplomacy, the former Yugoslavia became known as the [[state union]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The process of becoming a single state union ironically lead to the separation of the two states - a change which was officiated by the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum on Montenegrin independence]] on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. Of them, 230,661 votes or 55.5% were in favour of independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5007364.stm |title=Montenegro vote result confirmed |publisher=BBC News   |date=23 May 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since independence, the Montenegrin society has been divided among many issues. The independence supporters are advocating for the creation of a separate [[Montenegrin language]], regarded before as a dialect of the [[Serbian language]], including the creation of a new Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet which is basically the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet with the addition of two new letters. The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]] from the jurisdiction of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. The Montenegrin language lacks ISO code, and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized.

The links between the two nations remains strong, and the fact that for the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further strengthens the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main turistic destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the economic balance and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong.

==Culture==

===Language===
The national language of Montenegro has historically and traditionally been called Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Roland Sussex]], Paul Cubberly, ''The Slavic Languages'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2006; esp. v. pp. 73: "Serbia had used Serbian as an official language since 1814, and Montenegro even earlier.".&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pavle Ivić]], two sub-dialects of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] (of the [[Serbian language]]) were spoken in Montenegro: the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] and [[Zeta-South Sanjak dialect]]. The Eastern Herzegovinian dialect is spoken in Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Today, the national standard is based on the Zeta-South Sanjak dialect.

Some 42.9% of the population of the country speak Serbian as their mother tongue, including 37% of the declared Montenegrins. Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until 2007 when the new [[Constitution of Montenegro]] replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/10/26/feature-02 |title='&amp;#39;Pro-Serbian parties oppose Montenegro constitution'&amp;#39; |publisher=Setimes.com |date=26 October 2007 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montenegrin language]] was made the sole official language of the country and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.co.me/strana.asp?kat=1&amp;id=1278 |title=Ustav Crne Gore |publisher=Snp.co.me |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2014}}

Since 2006, both in linguistic and other aspects of cultural life, ethnic Serbs of Montenegro have been exposed to gradual "non-coercive" Montenegrinisation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/6d249ad4-06f2-11dc-93e1-000b5df10621 Financial Times (2007): Neil MacDonald, Montenegro’s ethnicity debate intensifies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs are adherents of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], the strongest religious institution of Montenegro (with a total of 460,383 followers or 74%).&lt;ref&gt;see: [[Religion in Montenegro]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest places of worship is the [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] in [[Podgorica]].

The future of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro has been threatened by the newly formed [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]] which has claimed Serbian Orthodox churches in Montenegro, and is backed by a small percentage of the Orthodox Christians in Montenegro. The government has recognized the church, however none of the Eastern Orthodox churches have. The leader is the controversial [[Miraš Dedeić]], a former Serbian Orthodox clergyman with Serbian nationalist views that after being suspended from the Serbian Church, went to Rome and became a Greek Orthodox clergyman.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

He was later suspended by the Serbian Orthodox Church after committing adultery with a younger woman. In 1997 he was excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eastern Orthodox Church.

[[File:Montenegrin cap.jpg|thumb|120px|right|A [[Montenegrin cap]] with the [[Serbian cross]].]]
The [[Montenegrin cap]] is a traditional hat for ethnic Serbs in Montenegro and in later times the self identifying Montenegrins, originally in the shape of a flat [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], having a red upper surface (called ''tepeluk'') not dissimilar to the [[Herzegovina]] and [[Lika cap]]s. It was wholly red until Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]] surrounded it with a [[black]] rim (called ''derevija''),&lt;ref&gt;"Crna Gora i Crnogorci" by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied [[Kosovo]]. The [[Kosovo Myth]] was very popular in the [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro]]. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Peter II was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;"O najstarijoj kapi kod Jugoslovena..." by Miodrag Vlahović&lt;/ref&gt; The national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was sign of grief for the [[Serbian Empire|once big Empire]], the red the bloody defeat at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]&lt;ref&gt;Crna Gora... Narodni život i običaji" by Andrija Jovićević&lt;/ref&gt; and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once greater Serbian realm,&lt;ref&gt;"Crnogorska muška kapa" by Zorica Radulović&lt;/ref&gt; which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince [[Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš]]. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered.&lt;ref&gt;"Fizicki lik i izgled Njegosa" by Jovan Vukmanović&lt;/ref&gt; Worn by the rulers and chieftains, the version with the [[Serbian cross|Four Ocil symbol]] in the star's place had become across the years with growth of nationalism excessively popular amongst the ordinary people, the symbol of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which effectively worked on maintaining and raising the national identity.

'''Sheldon Glueck''' (August 15, 1896 – March 10, 1980) was a [[Polish-American]] [[criminologist]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Staff report (March 13, 1980). [https://www.nytimes.com/1980/03/13/archives/sheldon-glueck-of-harvard-dies-studied-the-roots-of-delinquency.html Sheldon Glueck of Harvard Dies; Studied the Roots of Delinquency.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife [[Eleanor Glueck]] collaborated extensively on research related to [[juvenile delinquency]] and developed the "Social Prediction Tables" model for predicting the likelihood of delinquent behavior in youth. They were the first criminologists to perform studies of chronic juvenile offenders and among the first to examine the effects of [[psychopathy]] among the more serious delinquents.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Staff report (September 26, 1972). [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/26/archives/eleanor-glueck-expert-olq-grime-writer-on-delinquency-with-her.html Eleanor Glueck, expert on crime; Writer on delinquency with her husband dead at 74.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] during the [[Russian Empire]], he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1920. He received his PhD from [[Harvard University]] and taught there from 1925 to 1963.

== Career ==
Glueck's brother [[Bernard Glueck, Sr.]] introduced him to his future wife Eleanor, then employed by Bernard. Eleanor and Sheldon Glueck embarked upon an internationally recognized partnership in criminology that would last the remainder of their lives. Their landmark studies of inmates at the [[Massachusetts Reformatory]] examined the efficacy of the penal system and [[recidivism]] rates. In their controversial 1950 work ''Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency'' the two claimed that potential deviants could be identified by as young as six years of age. They would collaborate on more than 250 publications, beginning with ''Five Hundred Criminal Careers'' (1930), followed by ''Five Hundred Delinquent Women'' (1934) and ''One Thousand Juvenile Delinquents'' (1934). For the juvenile delinquents, they made attempts to predict criminality using [[statistics]], followed by the likelihood of their [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] upon release.&lt;ref name=sicherman_green1980&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sicherman, Barbara |author2=Green, Carol Hurd | year=1980 | page=278&amp;ndash;280 | title=Notable American women: the modern period: a biographical dictionary | volume=4 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=0-674-62733-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first criminologists to perform studies of chronic juvenile offenders and among the first to examine the effects of [[psychopathy]] among the more serious delinquents. Their studies showed that psychopathy was 20 times more common among juvenile delinquents.&lt;ref name=regoli_et_al2009&gt;{{cite book |author1=Regoli, Robert M. |author2=Hewitt, John D. |author3=DeLisi, Matt | year=2009 | pages=69–70 | title=Delinquency in Society | edition=8th | publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | isbn=0-7637-6434-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, they began a ten-year [[longitudinal study]] that was published as ''Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency'' (1950). This resulted in the Gluecks' "Social Prediction Tables" that gave predictions of the likelihood of juvenile delinquency based upon parameters from when the youths were six years old.

During the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]] he was one of the leading advocates for the creation of an international criminal court to punish [[crimes against humanity]].

'''''Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War''''' is a [[nonfiction]] scientific warfare book written by award-winning author and [[University of Wyoming]] professor, [[Jeffrey A. Lockwood]]. Published in 2008 by [[Oxford University Press]], the book explores the history of [[bioterrorism]], [[entomological warfare]], [[biological warfare]], and the prevention of [[agro-terrorism]] from the earliest times to modern threats.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; Lockwood, an entomologist, preceded this book with ''Ethical issues in biological control'' (1997) and ''Locust: The devastating rise and mysterious disappearance of the insect that shaped the American frontier'' (2004), among others.

==Summary==

'''The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire''' ('''MFQ''') is an inventory tool that measures [[Depression (mood)|depressive symptoms]] in children and young adults. The questionnaire consists of a variety of statements describing feelings or behaviors that may manifest as depressive symptoms in children. The subject is asked to indicate how much each statement applies to their recent experiences. The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire is created both in the form of a self-report questionnaire for the child to complete as well as a parent questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=L|last2=Vostanis|first2=P|last3=Feehan|first3=C|title=Detection of major and minor depression in children and adolescents: evaluation of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire.|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines|date=July 1997|volume=38|issue=5|pages=565–73|pmid=9255700|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01543.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a short version (13 questions) and a long version (33 questions) of both child and parent forms of the MFQ. Several peer-reviewed studies have found the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire to be a reliable and valid measure of depression in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daviss|first1=WB|last2=Birmaher|first2=B|last3=Melhem|first3=NA|last4=Axelson|first4=DA|last5=Michaels|first5=SM|last6=Brent|first6=DA|title=Criterion validity of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire for depressive episodes in clinic and non-clinic subjects.|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines|date=September 2006|volume=47|issue=9|pages=927–34|pmid=16930387|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01646.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Question breakdown, scoring and interpretation ==
The MFQ is scored by summing together the point values of responses for each item. The response choices and their designated point values are as follows:

*'''0 points:''' "not true" 
*'''1 point:''' "somewhat true" 
*'''2 points:''' "true"

Scores on the short version of the MFQ range from 0 to 26, while scores on the long version range from 0 to 66. Higher scores on the MFQ suggest more severe depressive symptoms. Scoring a 12 or higher on the short version and a 27 or higher on the long version may indicate the presence of depression in the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=A|last2=Kroll|first2=L|last3=Moore|first3=A|last4=Harrington|first4=R|title=Properties of the mood and feelings questionnaire in adolescent psychiatric outpatients: a research note.|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines|date=February 1995|volume=36|issue=2|pages=327–34|pmid=7759594|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb01828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tourism in Cuba''' is an industry that generates over 4.5 million arrivals in 2017, and is one of the main sources of revenue for the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onecaribbean.org/information/documentview.php?rowid=4153|title=One Caribbean - 2004 Cuban tourism statistics|author=|date=|website=onecaribbean.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its favorable [[climate]], beaches, colonial architecture and distinct [[Culture of Cuba|cultural]] history, [[Cuba]] has long been an attractive destination for tourists. "Cuba treasures 253 protected areas, 257 national monuments, 7 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 7 Natural Biosphere Reserves and 13 Fauna Refuge among other non-tourist zones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/cuba/3564-cuba-as-a-destination-ready-for-the-tsunami|title=Cuba as a Destination: Ready for the Tsunami? - ACN|first=|last=cubanew/ain|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been Spain's closest colony to the United States until 1898, in the first part of the 20th century Cuba continued to benefit from big investments, creation of industries, and travel. Its proximity and close relation to the United States also helped Cuba's market economy prosper fairly quickly. As [[Cuba-United States relations|relations between Cuba and the United States]] deteriorated rapidly after the [[Cuban Revolution]] and the resulting expropriation and nationalization of businesses, the island became cut off from its traditional market by an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] and a travel ban was imposed on U.S. citizens visiting Cuba. The tourist industry declined to record low levels within two years of Castro's accession to power. Unlike the US, [[Canada]] normalized relations with Cuba in the 1910s and Canadians increasingly visited Cuba for vacations.  Approximately one third of visitors to Cuba each year (in 2014) are Canadians.  The Cuban government has moderated its nationalization policies and allowed for private business since 1980.  It also pursues revitalization programs aimed at boosting tourism.   United States reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2015 and the tourism industry is expected to greatly benefit from normalized relations with US in the near future.

==Overview==
Until 1997, contacts between tourists and Cubans were ''de facto'' outlawed by the Communist regime.&lt;ref name=corbett&gt;{{cite book

To ensure the isolation of international tourism from the state isolated Cuban society, it was to be promoted in enclave [[resort]]s where, as much as possible, tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, known to as "enclave tourism" and "tourism apartheid".&lt;ref name=Espinoza&gt;Espinoza, Maria Dolores. {{cite web|url= http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba10/espino.pdf |title=Cuban Tourism During the Special Period }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(234&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]])}}, Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy (ASCE), Volume 10, August 3–5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, [[tourism]] surpassed Cuba's traditional export industry, sugar, as the nation's leading source of revenue. Visitors come primarily from Canada and western Europe and tourist areas are highly concentrated around [[Varadero]], [[Cayo Coco]], the beach areas north of [[Holguin]], and [[Havana]]. The impact on Cuba's [[socialist state|socialist society]] and economy has been significant. However, in recent years Cuba's tourism has decreased due to the economic recession, escalating foreign investment conflicts and fears, and internal economic restrictions. Since its reopening to tourism in the mid-1990s Cuba has not met the projected growth, has had relatively little restoration, and slow growth. A lack of foreign investment has also had a negative effect. Since then, the [[Dominican Republic]] has surpassed Cuba in tourism, new development, and investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidetocaribbeanvacations.com/descriptions/index.html/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:VisitorsCuba.png|thumb|370px|right|Visitors in Cuba, 1985-2011]]
[[Cuba]] has long been a popular attraction for [[tourism|tourists]]. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Miguel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-tourism.org/quality_/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf|title=International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy Miguel Alejandro Figueras|author=|date=|website=world-tourism.org}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. Such tourism became Cuba's third largest source of foreign currency, behind the two dominant industries of [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]]. Cuban drinks such as the [[daiquiri]] and [[mojito]] became common in the United States during this time, after Prohibition was repealed.

A combination of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the end of prohibition, and World War II severely dampened Cuba's tourist industry, and it wasn't until the 1950s that numbers began to return to the island in any significant force. During this period, American [[organized crime]] came to dominate the leisure and tourist industries, a modus operandi outlined at the infamous [[Havana Conference]] of 1946. By the mid-1950s [[Havana]] became one of the main markets and the favourite route for the [[narcotics]] trade to the United States. Despite this, tourist numbers grew steadily at a rate of 8% a year and Havana became known as "the Latin [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]".&lt;ref name="Miguel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/batist.htm History of Cuba] written and compiled by J.A. Sierra&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cuba011.jpg|thumb|270px|left|[[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] in Havana. The hotel's guestlist includes [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and also played host to the infamous [[Havana Conference]] in 1946]]
Immediately upon becoming [[President of Cuba]] after the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959, [[Manuel Urrutia]] ordered the closing of many bars and gambling halls associated with prostitution and the drug trade, this effectively ending Cuba's image as a hedonistic escape. A new governmental body, the National Institute of the Tourism Industry (INTUR), was established to encourage more tourism; taking over hotels, clubs, and beaches making them available to the general public at low rates. Tourist board chief Carlos Almonia announced a program of huge investment in hotels and the creation of a new airport.  But fears of Cuba's post-revolutionary status amongst Americans, who constituted 8 out of 10 of visitors,&lt;ref name="Miguel"/&gt; meant a rapid decrease in travel to the island.

In January 1961, relations between the nations deteriorated as a result of bank and business expropriations, mass exodus, [[summary executions]], and private property being declared illegal by a now openly communist regime being backed by the [[USSR]]. Tourism travel to Cuba was soon declared by the [[U.S. State Department]] to be contrary to U.S. foreign policy and against the national interest. Tourism that year dropped to a record low of a mere 4180, forcing a dramatic downsizing of Cuba's tourist plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkhtml&amp;contentId=867459 Revolution to revolution: why is tourism booming in Cuba?] Chandana Jayawardena&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors to Cuba during the 1960s, 70s and 80s were comparatively rare. The number of tourists to the island did increase slowly, but it wasn't until 1989 that they were to equal pre-Revolutionary numbers.&lt;ref name="Miguel"/&gt;

The collapse [[Revolutions of 1989|of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe]] in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a crisis in the Cuban economy. The Soviets were Cuba's chief trading partner, and had effectively sheltered Cuba's sugar industry with large subsidies for 30 years. The lack of economic diversification during this period, and the sudden loss of key markets sent the country into a deep economic depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. The crisis precipitated the communist regime to find new avenues of income.

Policies were drawn up to satisfy the growing tourist markets of Canada and Europe with an aim to replace Cuba's reliance on the sugar industry and gain much needed foreign currency rapidly. A new Ministry of Tourism was created in 1994, and the Cuban state invested heavily in tourist facilities. Between 1990 and 2000, more than $3.5 billion was invested in the tourist industry. The number of rooms available to international tourists grew from 12,000 to 35,000,&lt;ref name="Rockefeller"&gt;[http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/?article_id=58 Tourism Development for the Cuban Economy]. Rockefeller center online.&lt;/ref&gt; and the country received a total of 10 million visitors over that period.&lt;ref name="Miguel"/&gt; By 1995 the industry had surpassed sugar as Cuba's chief earner.

Today, travelers from around the world visit Cuba, arriving by a mixture of scheduled and [[charter airlines]] to one of Cuba's ten international airports. By far the largest number come from [[Canada]], where arrivals have been increasing by almost 10% annually since 2007. Europeans follow next, primarily arriving from Great Britain, Spain, Italy, France and Germany. According to the official government agency, it is unknown exactly how many Americans travel to Cuba each year as tourists, in violation of U.S. trade policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubanews.com/sections/tourist-arrivals-to-cuba-increase-despite-eurozone-troubles&lt;/ref&gt; According to some statistics around 20,000 to 30,000 Americans illegally travel to Cuba every year, while the Cuban government puts it higher at over 60,000.{{cn|date = June 2016}} Americans either fly on the direct charter flights or reach Cuba via flights from Canada or Mexico. In June 2016, the US government authorised six airlines to start direct scheduled flights, but this was later revoked by President Trump in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/CubanonHavanaFactSheet.pdf?mc_cid=25434ad46b&amp;mc_eid=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/10/united-states-airlines-scheduled-flights-cuba/85693838/|title=U.S. airlines chosen for scheduled flights to Cuba|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2015, all visitors paid a $25 exit tax at the airport prior to departure but this is now included in the costs of the flight.

==Foreign investment==
Foreign investment in the Cuban tourism sector has increased steadily since the tourism drive. This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist [[command economy]], to allow for the recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An additional factor cited by foreign investors is the degree of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cqx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/46/2/223.pdf Hotel and the enormous tourism developments in Cuba] Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influx of foreign capital, and associated capitalist management methods, led outside observers to question whether Cuba's socialist system could survive the resulting transformation. Fidel Castro responded in 1991,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the conditions of a small country like Cuba... It is very difficult to develop... relying on one's own resources. It is for this reason that we have no alternative but to associate ourselves with those foreign enterprises that can supply capital, technology, and markets." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Castro was also of the belief that despite the undeniable influence of "capitalist ideology", socialism would prevail both in Cuba and the wider "battle of ideas".&lt;ref name=Gunn&gt;Gunn, Gillian. {{cite web|url= http://www.trinitydc.edu/academics/depts/Interdisc/International/caribbean%20briefings/TheSociologicalImpact.pdf |title=The Sociological Impact of Rising Foreign Investment }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(82.5&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, [[Georgetown University]] Cuba Briefing Paper Series, "Tourist Apartheid", January 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism and the environment==
The Cuban government has established safeguards designed to ensure that tourism and other development do not result in significant environmental impacts.  The development of new tourist facilities and related infrastructure in Cuba must, among other things, proceed in accordance with Cuban environmental laws and policies.  In 1995 the Cuban government established the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (CITMA) and in 1997 the National Assembly has enacted Law 81 of the Environment, one of the most comprehensive "framework" environmental laws in the region.  Pursuant to that Law, the government adopted a number of decree laws and resolutions aimed at ensuring that future development (including tourism development) is sustainable.  Of particular importance to tourism development is Decree Law 212, Coastal Zone Management, which establishes setbacks and other siting requirements for new facilities in coastal areas.  CITMA Resolution 77/99 requires a thorough environmental assessment of major new construction projects and requires that project developers obtain an environmental license from CITMA.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Whittle, et al., International Tourism and the Protection of Cuba's Coastal and Marine Environments, in Tulane Environmental Law Journal, Volume 16, Summer 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health tourism===
{{Further|Healthcare in Cuba}}
As well as receiving traditional tourism revenues, Cuba attracts [[health tourists]], generating annual revenues of around $40 million for the Cuban economy. Cuba has been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. In 2005, more than 19,600 foreign patients traveled to Cuba for a wide range of treatments including [[eye surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=2010-01-28 }} Caribbean News Net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Some complaints have arisen that foreign "health tourists" paying with dollars receive a higher quality of care than do Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr. [[Hilda Molina]] asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]], the Cuban government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise, thus creating a disparity in the quality of healthcare services between Cubans and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 Cuban Medicine Today by Dr [[Hilda Molina]]] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529183606/http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 |date=2006-05-29 }} Center for a free Cuba - link fails 16.9.06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mountain tourism===
The recent studies shows that Cuba has a huge potential for [[mountaineering]] activity, however, it is not utilized properly. The mountaineering in Cuba should be considered to be one of the key contributors (as well as other forms of active tourism e.g. biking, diving, caving) to the development, prosperity, and well-being of all stakeholders, and especially for the communities outside the tourism enclaves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apollo, M. &amp; Rettinger, R.|date=2018-03-07|title=Mountaineering in Cuba: improvement of true accessibility as an opportunity for regional development of communities outside the tourism enclaves|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2018.1446920|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|doi=10.1080/13683500.2018.1446920|issn=1368-3500}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, mountaineering regions mostly lie outside the enclaves, so no conflict will exist between active and [[All-inclusive_resort|all-inclusive]] tourism. And what is most important is that tourism product diversification (both product and spatial) can be achieved&lt;ref&gt;Rettinger, R. &amp; Apollo, M. (2017).

Furthermore, by creating spatial and thematic product links as well as synergies (also with all-inclusive tourism), mountaineering, as well as other forms of active tourism (e.g. biking, diving, caving) often develop in destinations&lt;ref&gt;Benur, A.

===Sex tourism===
{{main article|Prostitution in Cuba}}
Although [[Fidel Castro]] sought to eliminate prostitution after taking power, the discrepancy between typical Cuban wages (less than one US dollar per day) and the spending power of foreign tourists lures some Cubans, including minors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, allegations of widespread [[sex tourism]] have been downplayed by Cuban justice minister Maria Esther Reus.&lt;ref name="Justice Minister"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tamayo|first=Juan O.|title=Cuba’s Justice Minister says the government fights prostitution|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/16/3691714/cubas-justice-minister-says-the.html|accessdate=2 January 2014|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Miami Herald, prostitution is not illegal in Cuba, but procuring a prostitute for others is outlawed. The age of sexual consent on the island is 16.&lt;ref name="Justice Minister"/&gt; According to a travel advice website by the government of Canada, "Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Advice and Advisories for Cuba: Sex tourism|url=http://travel.gc.ca/destinations/cuba|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to import or produce pornography in Cuba.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

While the growth of tourism has benefited the city of Havana economically, there have been several negative side effects. One such side effect is the revival of sex tourism in the city. Sex tourism was a central part of the tourism industry before the Revolution. However, after 1960, prostitution was essentially eradicated on the island due to government initiatives and a significant drop in demand as tourism was minimized.&lt;ref name="Trumbull"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trumbull |first1=C. |title=Prostitution and Sex Tourism in Cuba |journal=Cuba in Transition |publisher=American Society for the Study of the Cuban Economy |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; With tourism becoming more prevalent in the 1990s, however, so did the practice of prostitution. The demographic profile of tourists (the overwhelming majority being men between ages 25–60) is a key indicator of the existence of prostitution. Additionally, websites and magazines, such as Playboy, have outlined the opportunities for both heterosexual and homosexual sex tourism.&lt;ref name="Trumbull"/&gt; According to Trumbull, many prostitutes engage in the practice out of economic necessity, but they do not work in oppressive conditions and a large number of prostitutes in contemporary Havana see the work as a way to earn a better living than if they were to work in open jobs throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Trumbull"/&gt; Therefore, contemporary prostitution is different than the sex tourism of the 1950s in this regard.

== Tourism: Economic Reform ==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

Cuba remains one of the few countries with an economy established by a centralized government. Among those countries, only Cuba possesses a large international tourism sector &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharpley|first1=Richard|last2=Knight|first2=Martin|title=Tourism and the State in Cuba: From the Past to the Future|journal=International Journal of Tourism|date=2009|volume=11|issue=3|page=241-254|doi=10.1002/jtr.685|url=ncsu.summon.serialssolutions.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fall of the USSR and the U.S embargo imposed in 1961 affected Cuba’s tourism sector. Cuba was dependent on the USSR and after its collapse saw tourism as an option to reduce the effects of the crisis. Cuba’s touring numbers began to decrease during the 1960s through the 1980s due to the U.S embargo during the Cold War. Additionally, almost 62,000 tourists traveled to Cuba in 1960, 4180 tourists in 1961 and then almost zero over the next 20 years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cerviño|first1=Julio|last2=Cubillo|first2=José|title=Hotel and Tourism Development in Cuba: Opportunities, Management Challenges, and Future Trends|journal=Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly|date=2005|volume=46|issue=2|page=223-246|url=proxying.lib.ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, new hotels were built and old hotels were renovated to draw more international visitors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Babb|first1=Florence|title=Che, Chevys, and Hemingway's daiquiris: Cuban tourism in a time of globalisation|journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research|date=2011|volume=30|issue=1|page=50-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When Raul Castro rose to power in 2008, he implemented infrastructure reform to help reduce the effects of the Cuban revolution. The Cuban government built beach resorts in order to further expand tourism. Castro’s reform policies led to increased tourism and large economic success in Cuba. In fact 2.7 million people visited Cuba in 2011, while only 340,000 people toured Cuba in 1990 &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hingtgen|first1=Nathan|last2=Kline|first2=Carol|last3=Fernandes|first3=Luci|last4=McGehee|first4=Nancy|title=Cuba in transition: Tourism industry perceptions of entrepreneurial change|journal=Tourism Management|date=2015|volume=50|page=184-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The National GDP increased from 30.69 billion in 2002 to 114.10 billion in 2010 &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. While infrastructure reform benefitted Cuba’s GDP and tourism numbers, average spending decreased from $1,310 in 1995 to $876 in 2015. Furthermore, Cuba ranks one of the lowest for returns in the travel industry. Contributing to the low rank: low quality food, poor customer service, and affordability. These issues must be resolved in order to maintain Cuba’s tourism economically in the long-term &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;.

==Casas particulares==
{{Main|Casa particular}}
In the context of tourism, a private residence in Cuba which has been converted to allow paid lodging, usually on a short-term basis, akin to [[bed and breakfast]] residences elsewhere, is usually referred to as a "casa particular", which simply means "private house". These are typically single-family residences, and are a very popular choice for tourists. Prices can range from 15 to 30 euros per night or less for longer stays. The casas provide an inexpensive option for young or independent tourists. A stay in a private casa allows tourists more opportunity to mix with local Cubans, and engage in Cuban cultural life.

== Social impacts  of tourism ==
As tourism played an increasing role in the economy, a large percentage of young people migrate to resort towns seeking employment in the tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/tourism-cuba-threatens-drive-income-inequality-regional-disparities-risk-334069|title=Tourism In Cuba Threatens To Drive Up Income Inequality, Regional Disparities, Risk|date=11 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them working in menial jobs can earn more through tips than they can employed as professionals. Thus, there is an economic and social divide emerging in Cuba between those employed in the tourist industry and others.

===Tourist vs Cuban hotels===
[[File:Cocotaxis.jpg|thumb|270px|"Cocotaxis" in Plaza de la Revolución, [[Havana]]. Because of the rapid growth of tourism in Cuba, taxi drivers can earn more than lawyers and doctors.]]

Between 1992 and 2008, in order to gain the much-needed [[hard currency]], some hotels and resorts were opened only to foreign tourists, leading to accusations of "tourism apartheid". The policy was reversed by the Cuban government in 2008.

Cuba's tourism policies of the early 1990s, which were driven by the government's pressing need to earn hard currency,&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;Cave, Damien. [http://dir.salon.com/story/people/feature/2002/02/06/cuba_apart/index.html Tourism apartheid in Cuba], ''[[Salon.com]]'', February 6, 2002. Retrieved July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; had a major impact on the underlying [[egalitarianism]] espoused by the [[Cuban revolution]].&lt;ref name="Trento"&gt;Ternto, Angelo : ''Castro and Cuba : From Revolution To The Present'' p114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Facio2&gt;Facio, Elisa.

Republished in ''DES: A Scholarly Journal of Ethnic Studies'', Volume 1 Number 1, [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] Department of Ethnic Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farah/&gt; Two parallel economies and societies quickly emerged, divided by their access to the newly legalized [[U.S. dollar]]. Those having access to dollars through contact with the lucrative tourist industry suddenly found themselves at a distinct financial advantage over professional, industrial and agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="Trento"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;http://www.miami.com/mld/elnuevo/news/world/cuba/16032860.htm Cuba: dólares ahondan las diferencias de clase [[El Nuevo Herald]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure the isolation of international tourism from Cuban society, tourism was to be promoted in enclave [[resort]]s where, as much as possible, tourists would be segregated from Cuban society. This was not lost on the average Cuban citizen, and the government tourism policy soon began to be referred to as "enclave tourism" and "tourism apartheid".&lt;ref name=espino&gt;Espino, María Dolores. {{cite web|url= http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba10/espino.pdf |title=Cuban Tourism During the Special Period }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(234&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy (ASCE), Volume 10, August 3–5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, as Cuba entered a period of severe economic austerity, Fidel Castro defended the newly instituted policies in a speech to the [[National Assembly of Cuba|Cuban National Assembly]]. He described the moves as an economic necessity that would need to be maintained for as long as the country had a need for foreign currency. According to Castro, the government was "pondering formulas" that would allow Cubans to use some of the tourist facilities as a reward for outstanding work, but he believed that giving Cubans access to amenities at the expense of paying foreign tourists would ultimately be a counterproductive move for the economy.&lt;ref name=Farah&gt;Farah, Douglas. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/cuba/stories/econ080992.htm Catering to Foreigners Instead of Cubans Puts Castro on Defensive] ''[[Washington Post]]'' Foreign Service Sunday, August 9, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1997, contact between tourists and Cubans was ''de facto'' outlawed, and Cubans seen in contact with tourists were regarded as potential thieves by police.&lt;ref name=corbett/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rennie" /&gt; Global human-rights groups' complaints, and the upcoming visit of [[Pope John Paul II|The Pope]], helped cause an about-face, although such contact is still frowned upon. Police often demand identification checks of any Cubans seen in contact with tourists.&lt;ref name=corbett/&gt; Tourist identification is usually not checked unless the tourist has dark skin and is mistaken for Cuban.&lt;ref name=corbett/&gt; Despite the restrictions, average Cubans thrive on Cuba's tourist industry,&lt;ref name=corbett/&gt;&lt;ref name = Amrhein&gt;Amrhein, Saundra and Lush, Tamara.

[[File:Old Havana street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A street in the popular tourist district of [[Old Havana]]]]

The policy of restricting certain hotels and services to tourists was ended by the government of [[Raúl Castro]] in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/cubans-allowed-to-stay-at-tourist-hotels/20080331-22qy.html Cubans allowed to stay at tourist hotels] Sydney Morning Herald - March 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As well as officially allowing Cubans to stay in any hotel, the change also opened access to previously restricted areas such as [[Cayo Coco]]. However, access remains very limited in practice{{cn|date=June 2016}}, as the vast majority of Cubans do not have access to the hard currency needed to stay in such hotels.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The lives of '''women in China''' have significantly changed throughout reforms in the late [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican period]], the [[Chinese Civil War]], and rise of the [[People's Republic of China]], which had announced publicly on the commitment toward gender equality.&lt;ref name="permanent mission"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Office|title=Gender Equality and Women's Development in China|url=http://www.china-un.ch/eng/bjzl/t210715.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229231641/http://www.china-un.ch/eng/bjzl/t210715.htm |archivedate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts the new Communist government made toward gender equality were met with resistance in the historically male-dominated [[Chinese society]], and obstacles continue to stand in the way of women seeking to gain greater equality in China.

==Historical background==
{{Further information|Women in ancient and imperial China|Son preference in China}}
[[File:A Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zetian.JPG|thumb|Empress [[Wu Zetian]]]]
Pre-modern Chinese society was predominantly [[patriarchal]] and [[patrilineal]] from at least the 11th century BC onwards.{{sfnp|Wu|2009|p=86}} The freedoms and opportunities available to women varied depending on the time period and regional situation. The status of women was, like that of men, closely tied to the [[Chinese kin|Chinese kinship system]].{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=2}} There has long been a son preference in China, leading to high rates of [[female infanticide]], as well as a strong tradition of restricting the [[freedom of movement]] of women, particularly upper class women, manifested through the practice of [[foot binding]]. The legal and social status of women has greatly improved in the 20th century, especially in the 1970s after the One-Child Polity and Reform and Opening-up Policy came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=M. H.|date=2012|title=The one-child policy and gender equality in education in China: Evidence from household data.|url=|journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1007/s10834011-9277-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic life==

===Marriage and family planning===
{{Further information|Chinese marriage}}
[[File:Madonna_of_China_NGM-v31-p555.jpg|thumb|Mother carrying two children, 1917]]
Traditional [[marriage]] in prerevolutionary [[China]] was a contract between families rather than between two individuals.&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=John W.|title=Marriage in the People's Republic of China: Analysis of a New Law|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 1984|volume=46|issue=4|pages=955–961|doi=10.2307/352547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents of the soon-to-be groom and bride arranged the marriage with an emphasis on the alliance between the two families.&lt;ref name="Tamney4"&gt;Tamney, J. B., &amp; Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Spouse selection was based on family needs and the socioeconomic status of the potential mate, rather than love or attraction.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Although the woman's role varied slightly depending on the social status of the husband, typically her main duty was to provide a son in order to continue the family name.&lt;ref name="Yao"&gt;Yao, E. L. (1983). Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present (p. 17). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[arranged marriage]] was accomplished by a matchmaker who acted as a link between two families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Guo-ming|title=Chinese conflict management and resolution|year=2002|publisher=Ablex Publishing|pages=289–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement of a marriage involved the negotiation of a [[bride price]], gifts to be bestowed to the bride's family, and occasionally a [[dowry]] of clothing, furniture, or jewelry from the family of the bride for use in her new home.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; The exchange of monetary compensation for a woman's hand in marriage was also utilized in purchase marriages in which women were seen as property that could be sold and traded at the husband's whim.&lt;ref name="Yao"/&gt;

Along with many of the older Chinese traditions surrounding marriage, there were also many ritualistic steps that took place. During the time of the Han Dynasty a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged did the real steps continue on, brides were taken to live in the ancestral homes of their husbands. Here, they were not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs as well. Many families during this time followed the Confusion teachings regarding honoring their elders, these rituals were passed down from father to son and so forth, official family lists were made up that contained names of all the sons and marital wives. Thus, brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. Further, when a husband dies the bride is seen as property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some bride families to get their daughters back, though never with her children who remained in the property of her husband's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history : global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29–30|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that in order to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society, the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]]. The law "was intended to cause ... fundamental changes ... aimed at family revolution by destroying all former patterns . .. and building up new relationships on the basis of new law and new ethics."&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Xiaorong Li, a researcher at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, asserts that the Marriage Law of 1950 not only banned the most extreme forms of female subordination and oppression, but also gave women the right to make their own marital decisions.&lt;ref name=Xiaorong&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Xiaorong|title=Gender Inequality in China and Cultural Relativismin Women, Culture and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities.|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=407–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marriage Law specifically prohibited [[concubinage]] and marriages when one party was sexually powerless, suffered from a venereal disease, [[leprosy]], or a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Thirty years after the implementation of the 1950 Marriage Law, China still faces serious issues, particularly in regards to population growth.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;

In a continuing effort to control marriage and family life, a marriage law was passed in 1980 and enacted in 1981.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; The Marriage Law banned arranged and forced marriages and shifted focus away from the dominance of men and onto the interests of the children and women.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Article 2 of the 1980 Marriage law directly states, "the lawful rights and interests of women, children and the aged are protected. Family planning is practiced".&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; Adults, both men and women, gained the right to lawful divorce.&lt;ref name="Tamney4"/&gt;

In an effort to fight the tenacity of tradition, Article 3 of the 1980 marriage law continued the ban of concubinage, [[polygamy]], and [[bigamy]].&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  The Marriage Law of 1980, Article 3, forbid mercenary marriages in which a [[bride price]] or dowry is paid.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  Although the law also generally prohibited the exaction of money or gifts in connection with any marriage arrangements, bride price and dowries were still practiced customs.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  According to Li, the traditional business of selling women in exchange for marriage returned after the law gave women the right to select their husbands.&lt;ref name= Xiaorong /&gt; In 1990, 18,692 cases were investigated by Chinese authorities&lt;ref name= Xiaorong /&gt;

Bride price payments are still common in rural areas, whereas dowries have not only become smaller but less common.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  Similarly in urban areas, the dowry custom has nearly disappeared. The bride price custom has transformed into providing gifts for the bride or her family.&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  Article 4 of the marriage law banned the usage of compulsion or the interference of third parties, stating, "marriage must be based upon the complete willingness of the two parties,"&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;  As Engel argues, the law also encouraged sexual equality by making daughters just as valuable as sons, particularly in regards to potential for old age insurance. Article 8 of the 1980 Marriage Law states, "after a marriage has been registered, the woman may become a member of the man's family, or the man may become a member of the woman's family, according to the agreed wishes of the two parties."&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt;

More recently, there has been a surge in Chinese-foreign marriages in mainland China, with data showing these types of marriages are more common in women than in men. In 2010, there were almost 40,000 women registered in Chinese-foreign marriages in mainland China. In comparison, there were less than 12,000 men registered in these types of marriages in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffreys|first=Elaine|author2=Wang Pan|title=The rise of Chinese-foreign marriage in mainland China, 1979-2010|journal=China Information|date=2013|volume=27|issue=3|pages=347–369|doi=10.1177/0920203x13492791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second wives====

In traditional China, polygamy was legal and having a concubine (See [[concubinage]]) was considered a luxury for aristocratic families.&lt;ref name="Suowei Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1950, polygamy was outlawed and it seemed, for a while, that extramarital affairs were unheard of. The [[New Marriage Law]] of 1950 allowed women in China to be able to divorce for the first time in China, which allowed women to leave husbands who had these extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name="Suowei Xiao"/&gt; The phenomenon of de facto [[polygamy]], or so-called "second wives" (二奶 èrnǎi in Chinese), has reemerged in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When polygamy was legal, women were more tolerant of their husbands extramarital affairs. Today, women who discover their husband has a "second wife" are less tolerant and now have the ability to ask for a divorce.&lt;ref name="C. Simon Fan and Hon-Kwong Liu 2004 442–452"&gt;{{cite journal

Men tend to travel to mainland China for work and business. Sudden industrialization in China brought two types of people together: young female workers and rich businessmen from cities like Hong Kong. Some rich businessmen start relationships with these women, known as "keeping a second wife" (bao yinai) in Cantonese.&lt;ref name="C. Simon Fan and Hon-Kwong Liu 2004 442–452"/&gt;
Many migrant women find it difficult to find husbands, so they make themselves more readily available to become the second wives and lovers of rich businessmen.&lt;ref name="Graeme Lang and Josephine Smart 2002 546–569"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men are attracted to these economically dependent women; the businessmen's first wives tended to stay at home and not work.
&lt;ref name="C. Simon Fan and Hon-Kwong Liu 2004 442–452"/&gt; There are many villages in southern part of China where predominantly these "second wives" live.
&lt;ref name="Graeme Lang and Josephine Smart 2002 546–569"/&gt; The men will come and spend a large amount of time in these villages every year while their first wife and family stay in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The relationships can range from just being casual sexual transactions that are paid for by the businessman to being long term relationships that develop into something more. If a relationship does become something more, some of the Chinese women quit their job and become 'live-in lovers' whose main job is to please the working man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The first wives in these situations have a hard time dealing with their husbands taking part in extramarital affairs, but women deal with it in different ways. Most women don't have much say because they are usually far away from their husbands. Even if the wives do move to China with their husbands, the businessman still find ways to carry on affairs. Some wives go into the situation with the motto "one eye open, with the other eye closed" meaning they understand their husbands are bound to cheat, but want to make sure they practice safe sex and do not bring home children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen |first1=Hsui-hua |chapter=Becoming 'the First Wives': Gender, Intimacy and the Regional Economy across the Taiwan Strait |title=East Asian Sexualities: Modernity Gender and New Sexual Cultures |date=2008 |pages=216–235 |publisher=Zed |isbn=9781842778883 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/East_Asian_sexualities.html?id=GSkoAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; What becomes confusing is the relationship with the children and the father who is almost always gone. Many first wives, in order to suppress the children's questions, downplay the fathers role and make it seem less important. Other women fear for their financial situations. In order to protect their life's work, some women try to protect their rights by putting the house and other major finances in their names instead of their husbands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This situation has created many social and legal issues. Unlike previous generations of [[arranged marriage]]s, the modern polygamy is more often voluntary.&lt;ref name="Graeme Lang and Josephine Smart 2002 546–569"/&gt; Women in China are facing serious pressures to be married, by family and friends. There is a derogatory term for women who are not married by the time they are in their late twenties, [[sheng nu]]. With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYs8hIusktI] There are now lawyers who specialize in representing these "second wives" so they are not taken advantage of if the relationship ends badly. See documentary attached, "China's Second Wives". [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYs8hIusktI] This documentary takes a look at the rights of second wives and some of the issues they face.

====Policies on divorce====
The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] empowered women to initiate divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=Elaine&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffreys|first=Elaine|title=Sex and Sexuality in China|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDe5PVjfsUMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Elaine Jeffreys, an Australian Research Council Future Fellow and Associate Professor in China studies, divorce requests were only granted if they were justified by politically proper reasons. These requests were mediated by party-affiliated organizations, rather than discredited legal systems.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt; Ralph Haughwout Folsom, a professor of Chinese law, [[international trade]], and [[international business]] transactions at the [[University of San Diego]], and, John H. Minan, a trial attorney in the Civil Division of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and a law professor at the University of San Diego, argue that the Marriage Law of 1950 allowed for much flexibility in the refusal of [[divorce]] when only one party sought it. During the market-based economic reforms, China re-instituted a formal legal system and implemented provisions for divorce on a more individualized basis.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt;

Jeffreys asserts that the Marriage Law of 1980 provided for divorce on the basis that emotions or mutual affections were broken.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt; As a result of the more liberal grounds for divorce, the divorce rates soared&lt;ref name=folsom&gt;{{cite book|last=Folsom|first=Ralph Haughwout|title=Law in the People's Republic of China: Commentary, Readings, and Materials|year=1989|publisher=M. Nijhoff Publishers|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As women began divorcing their husbands, tensions increased and much resistance was met from rural males.&lt;ref name="kay"&gt;Kay Ann Johnson, Women, the Family, and Peasant Revolution in China http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo5975509.html (accessed on 20, February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Although divorce was now legally recognized, thousands of women lost their lives for attempting to divorce their husbands and some committed suicide when the right to divorce was withheld.&lt;ref name="kay"/&gt; Divorce, once seen as a rare act during the [[Mao Zedong|Mao era]](1949–1976), has become more common with rates continuing to increase today.&lt;ref&gt;USC US-China Institute, "Divorce is increasingly common" {{cite web |url=http://www.china.usc.edu/ShowAverageDay.aspx?articleID=592 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219220539/http://www.china.usc.edu/ShowAverageDay.aspx?articleID=592 |archivedate=2014-02-19 |df= }} (accessed 26 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase in divorce, it became evident that divorced women were often given an unfair share or housing and property.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt;

The amended Marriage Law of 2001, which according to Jeffreys was designed to protect women's rights, provided a solution to this problem by reverting to a "moralistic fault-based system with a renewed focus on [[collectivist]] mechanisms to protect marriage and family."&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt; Although all property acquired during a marriage was seen as jointly-held,&lt;ref name=folsom/&gt;
it was not until the implementation of Article 46 of the 2001 Marriage Law that the concealment of [[joint property]] was punishable.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt; This was enacted to ensure a fair division during a divorce.&lt;ref name=Elaine/&gt; The article also granted the right for a party to request compensation from a spouse who committed illegal cohabitation, [[bigamy]], and family violence or desertion.&lt;ref name=Elaine /&gt;

===Domestic violence===
{{Further information|Domestic violence in China}}

In 2004, the [[All-China Women's Federation]] compiled survey results to show that thirty percent of the women in China experienced [[domestic violence]] within their homes. The Chinese Marriage Law was amended in 2001 to offer mediation services and compensation to those who subjected to domestic violence. Domestic violence was finally criminalized with the 2005 amendment of the Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of Women.&lt;ref name=Margi&gt;{{cite book|last=McCue|first=Margi Laird|title=Domestic violence: a reference handbook|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of public awareness of the 2005 amendment has allowed spousal abuse to persist.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;U.S. Department of State. "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006: China, (2007)". http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm (accessed on February 16, 2012).[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant increase in the prevalence of domestic violence in the [[People's Republic of China]] involving Chinese women committing violence against Chinese men.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; In 2003, 10 percent of violence in families involved male victims.

===Education===
{{main article| History of education in China| Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The gender gap in current enrollment widens with age because males are more likely to be enrolled than females at every age group in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1961 marked the sudden decrease in female enrollment in primary and secondary school. Female primary school enrollment suffered more than that of males during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] (1958–1961).&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt; Although the gender gap for secondary and primary education has narrowed over time, the gender gap at the highest education level remains much larger.&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt;

The One Percent Population Survey in 1987 found that in rural areas 48 percent of males aged 45 and above were [[Literacy|illiterate]] while on the other hand, 6 percent of males 15–19 years old were illiterate. Although the percentage of illiterate women decreased significantly from 88 percent to 15 percent, it is significantly higher than the percentage of illiterate men for the same age groupings.&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt;

===Health care===
{{Further information|Women's health in China}}
[[File:Girl with chopsticks at dumpling restaurant.jpg|thumb|A teenage girl with chopsticks]]
In traditional Chinese culture, which was a [[Women in ancient and imperial China|patriarchal society based on Confucian ideology]], women did not possess priority in healthcare. [[Health care]] was tailored to focus on men.&lt;ref name="hong"&gt;Hong, Lawrence K. "The Role of Women in the People's Republic of China: Legacy and Change." Social problems 23.5 (1976): 545-57.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/800477] (accessed 8 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese health care has since undergone much reform and has tried to provide men and women with equal health care. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), the [[People's Republic of China]] began to focus on the provision of health care for women.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt;

This change was apparent when the women in the Chinese workforce were granted health care. Health care policy required all women workers to receive urinalysis and vaginal examinations yearly.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt; The People's Republic of China has enacted various laws to protect the health care rights of women, including the Maternal and Child Care law. This law and numerous others focus on protecting the rights of all women in the People's Republic of China.

The phenomenon of the [[missing women of Asia]] is visible in China. The [[human sex ratio|ratio of men to women]] in China is much higher than would be expected biologically, and gender discrimination has contributed to this imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Yu MY, Sarri R. Women's health status and gender inequality in China. Soc Sci Med 45 (1997): 1885-1898. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953697001275]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[economist]], asserted in 1990 that over 100 million women were missing globally, with 50 million [[Missing women of China|women missing from China]] alone. Sen attributed the deficit in the number of women to sex-selective abortion, female [[infanticide]], and inadequate [[nutrition]] for girls, all of which have been encouraged by the [[One-child policy]].&lt;ref name="Sen"&gt;Sen, Amartya. "More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing?" New York Review of Books Vol. 37, No. 20 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

For women in China, the most likely cancer to be found is cervical cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests to use routine screening to confirm if this woman gets cervical cancer. However, information on cervical cancer screening is not quite available for women in China.

===Foreign women===
Some Vietnamese women from [[Lao Cai]] who married Chinese men stated that among their reasons for doing so was that Vietnamese men beat their wives, engaged in affairs with mistresses, and refused to help their wives with chores while Chinese men actively helped their wives carry out chores and care for them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cjoVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Chan 2013], p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study comparing Chinese and Vietnamese attitudes towards women, more Vietnamese than Chinese said that the male should dominate the family and a wife had to provide sex to her husband at his will.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tV6MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294 Yoshioka, DiNoia, Ullah 2013], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women was supported by more Vietnamese than Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iaQ3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134 Chung, Shibusawa 2013], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence was more accepted by Vietnamese women than Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1q4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142 Root, Brown, 2014], p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population control==

===One-child policy===

In 1956, the Chinese government publicly announced its goal to control the exponentially increasing population size. The government planned to use education and publicity as their main modes of increasing awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, C. C., and Frederica M. Bunge. Medicine in Rural China : A Personal Account. Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhou Enlai]] launched the first program for smaller families under the guidance of Madame Li Teh-chuan, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Health]] at the time.

{{Further information|Missing women of China|Female infanticide in China|List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio}}

The preference for sons coupled with the one-child-policy have led to a high rate of [[sex selective abortion]] in China. Mainland China has a highly masculine sex ratio.  The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] at birth (between male and female births) in [[mainland China]] reached 117:100 in the year 2000, substantially more masculine than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf |title=Sex Ratios at Birth in China |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718153354/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the State Population and Family Planning Commission, there will be 30 million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate =  2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between the increase of masculine [[sex ratio]] disparity on birth and the deployment of one child policy would appear to have been caused by the one-child policy.

The policy not only limits the number of births a family can have and it does not only cause gender imbalance but it also put pressures to women. Women are mostly blamed when giving birth to a baby girl as if they chose the gender of their baby. Women were subjected to forced abortions if they appear to be having a baby girl&lt;ref&gt;Anagnost, Ann Stasia. "Family Violence and Magical Violence: The Woman as Victim in China's One-Child Family Policy." Women and Language 11.2 (1988): 486-502. ProQuest. Web. 18 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation led to higher female infanticide rates and female deaths in China. The one-child policy stole the freedom the women have in deciding how to live their lives and in making their own decisions.

Other Asian regions also have higher than average ratios, including [[Taiwan]] (110:100), which does not have a family planning policy.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] report [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html Sex ratio]. The ratio in South Korea reached as high as 116:100 in the early 1990s but since then has moved substantially back toward a normal range, with a ratio of 107:100 in 2005. See "Where Boys Were Kings, a Shift Toward Baby Girls," https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html New York Times, December 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have explored the reason for the gender-based birthrate disparity in China as well as other countries. A study in 1990 attributed the high preponderance of reported male births in mainland China to four main causes: diseases which affect females more severely than males; the result of widespread [[under-reporting]] of female births;&lt;ref&gt;For a study in China that revealed under-reporting or delayed reporting of female births, see M. G. Merli and A. E. Raftery. 1990. "Are births under-reported in rural China? Manipulation of statistical records in response to China's population policies", ''Demography'' 37 (February): 109-126.&lt;/ref&gt; the illegal practice of [[sex-selective abortion]] made possible by the widespread availability of [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]]; and finally, acts of [[child abandonment]] and [[infanticide]].

===Iron Fist Campaign===
According to reports by the Amnesty International, family planning officials in [[Puning]] City, Guangdong Province launched the [[Iron Fist Campaign]] in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign targeted individuals for [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] in an attempt to control population growth. 9,559 individuals in Puning City were targeted for sterilization, some against their will.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; The targeted individuals were asked to go to governmental clinics where they would be sterilized. If they refused the procedure, then they put their families at risk for detainment.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

The Iron Fist Campaign lasted for 20 days and targeted 9,559 individuals.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; Approximately 50 percent consented and 1,377 relatives of targeted couples were detained.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; Family planning officials defended the Iron Fist Campaign, asserting that the large population of migrant workers in Puning misunderstood the [[One-child policy]] and therefore had not complied with family planning regulations.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; In an attempt to standardize family planning policies across all of China, the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002 was implemented. According to the Amnesty International, the law protects individual rights and bans the usage of coercion or detainment.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

==Property ownership==

In current-day China, women enjoy legal [[gender equality|equal rights]] to [[property]], but in practice these rights are often difficult to realize. However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law.  In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household.  This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.&lt;ref name="birge"&gt;Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male.  Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.&lt;ref name="mccreery"&gt;McCreery, John L. "Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia." Ethnology (1976): 163-174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the death of the head of household, property was passed to the eldest son.  In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.&lt;ref name="bernhardt"&gt;Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property.  In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers’ property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;  A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews.  With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted.  At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.&lt;ref name=mccreery /&gt;

In most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;  In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.&lt;ref name="ocko"&gt;Ocko, Jonathan K. "Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China." Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of family property.&lt;ref name=ocko /&gt;

The [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;&lt;ref name=ocko /&gt;  The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;

Inheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents.  Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;  Despite the law's equitable wording on property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.&lt;ref name=bernhardt /&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Deborah. "Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China." Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality.  The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang.  With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land.  In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. "Land management in rural China and its gender implications." Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head, or the eldest male.  So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household.  Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. "Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning." Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

For property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regards to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property.  The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;

Since most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows for courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child.  Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live.  In some divorce disputes "ownership" and "use" over property would be distinguished, giving a mother and child "use" of the family house without awarding the mother full ownership of the house.&lt;ref name=davis /&gt;

If we use female labor force participation as the indicator to measure gender equality, China would be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world: female labor force participation in China increased dramatically after the founding of the People's Republic and almost reached the universal level.&lt;ref name="bridgew.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |title=Women's Movement and Change of Women's Status in China |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152129/http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to a study by Bauer et al., of women who married between 1950 and 1965, 70 percent had jobs, and women who married between 1966 and 1976, 92 percent had jobs.&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt;

Even though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force at an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, parity in the workforce has not been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|author2=L. Song |title=Increasing urban wage inequality in China|journal=Economics of Transition|year=2003|volume=11|pages=597–619|doi=10.1111/j.0967-0750.2003.00168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1982, Chinese working women represented 43 percent of the total population, a larger proportion than either working American women (35.3 percent) or working Japanese women (36 percent).&lt;ref name="Chen, C.C. and Yu, KC and Miner, JB 1997 160"&gt;{{cite journal

===Rural work===
In traditional China, land was passed down from father to son and in the case of no son, the land was then given to a close male relative.&lt;ref name="matthews"&gt;Matthews, Rebecca and Victor Nee. Gender inequality and economic growth in rural China, Social Science Research, Vol. 29, No. 4 (2000): 606–632.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the past women in China were not granted ownership of land, today in rural areas of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], women possess pivotal roles in farming, which allows them control over the area's central sources of production.&lt;ref name="phatom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawski|first=Thomas G.|author2=Robert W. Mead |title=On the trail to China's phatom farmers|journal=World Development|year=1998|volume=26|issue=5|pages=776–781|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00012-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X98000126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population greatly affects the mode of farming that is utilized, which determines the duties women have in farming.&lt;ref name="Woman-Work"&gt;Davin, Delia (1976). ''Woman-Work: Women and the Party in Revolutionary China.'' p. 115. Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of "clearing a patch of vegetation
by the [[slash-and-burn]] method, growing assorted varieties of crops in the cleared land for one or two seasons and
then moving to a new plot of land on a rotational basis" is known as [[Shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref name="Rasul 2003 495–508"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasul|first=G|author2=G. B. Thapa |title=Shifting cultivation in the mountains of South and Southeast Asia: regional patterns and factors influencing the change|journal=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=2003|volume=14|issue=5|pages=495–508|doi=10.1002/ldr.570|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.570|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tishwayan Thomas Rawski, a professor of [[Economics]] and History at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], this method of agriculture is utilized in less populated areas and results in women performing more of the agricultural duties, whereas in more populated areas complicated [[Hoe-farming|plough cultivation]] is used.&lt;ref name="Rasul 2003 495–508"/&gt; Plough cultivation prepares the land for farming by loosening the soil, making it easier for seeds to be sown. Men typically perform plough cultivation but during periods of high demand women pitch in with agricultural duties of planting, harvesting and transporting.&lt;ref name="Women's Role in Economic Development"&gt;Boserup, Ester (1970). ''Women's Role in Economic Development'' Oxford: Allen and Unwin.[http://erae.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/4/598.short](accessed on 10 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Women also have key roles in tea cultivation and double cropping rice.&lt;ref name="Woman-Work"/&gt; Agricultural income is supplemented by women's work in animal rearing, spinning, basket construction, weaving, and the production of other various crafts.&lt;ref name="Woman-Work"/&gt;

===Urban and migrant work===
In the private sector, Chinese law mandates the coverage of maternity leave and costs of childbirth. These maternity laws have led to employers’ reluctance to hire women.&lt;ref&gt;Tatlow, Didi Kirsten. {{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/asia/26iht-china.html | deadurl=no |archivedate=18 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418195535/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/asia/26iht-china.html?_r=1 |title=For China's Women, More Opportunities, More Pitfalls.}} ''[[nytimes.com]]'', 25 November 2010 (accessed 22 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not only do China's enterprises have the largest proportion of employment in industries, this is also the case for the whole non-agricultural employment in China. The 1991 survey, for example, shows that a little more than one third of male and female employees in China in 1991 were in the area of industrial production. Furthermore, the proportion of female employees in the following areas to the total female employees surpasses the proportion of male employees to the total male employees: (1) professional and technical occupations, (2) commerce and service occupations, and (3) industrial production.&lt;ref name="bridgew.edu"/&gt;

The People's Republic of China's dependence on low-wage manufacturing to produce goods for the [[international market]] is due to changes in [[Economy of China|China's economic policies]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Change"&gt;Lee, Eliza W.Y. (2003). ''Gender and Change in Hong Kong: Globalization, Postcolonialism, and Chinese Patriarchy''.pp. 1-224. UBC Press,{{ISBN|0-7748-0994-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0994-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These economic policies have also encouraged the export industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fujita, Masahisa|author2=Hu, Dapeng|title=Regional disparity in China 1985–1994: The effects of globalization and economic liberalization|journal=The Annals of Regional Science|date=18 February 2001|volume=35|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s001680000020|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001680000020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban industrial areas are staffed with young migrant women workers who leave their rural homes. Since males are more likely than females to attend college, rural females often migrate to urban employment in hopes of supplementing their families’ incomes.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"&gt;China-Labour. [http://www.clb.org.hk/en/content/dagongmei-female-migrant-labourers "'Dagongmei' - Female Migrant Labourers."] pp. 1-8. Retrieved 27 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Factories in urban areas manufactured toys, clothing, electronics, and footwear primarily for exportation into the international world market.

In 1984 the reform of the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration marked an increase in the migration of rural Chinese workers. As the restrictions on residence became more lenient, less penalizing, and permitted people to travel to find employment, more women engaged in [[migrant labor]].&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt; In the cities, women could find low paying work as factory workers. These increased [[employment]] opportunities drew women out of rural areas in hopes of escaping poverty.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt; Although this reformed system enabled the migration of rural residents, it prohibited them from accepting any benefits in the cities or changing their permanent residence, which led to a majority of [[migrant worker]]s not receiving any forms of medical care, education, or housing.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt;  Currently 90 percent of migrant workers violate the Chinese [[employment|labor]] law by working without contracts.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt;

Nationally, male migrant workers outnumber female migrants 2:1, i.e. women comprise about 30% of the so-called 'floating population'.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt;  However, in some areas, Guangdong Province for example, the ratio favours women. In the industrial district of Nanshan in Shenzhen, 80 percent of the migrant workers were women. A preference for younger women over older women, has led to a predominantly young population of migrant workers.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt; Married women have more restrictions on mobility due to duties to the family, whereas younger women are more likely to not be married. Also, younger rural women are less likely to become pregnant, possess nimble fingers, more able to work longer hours, and are less knowledgeable about their statutory rights.&lt;ref name="Female Migrant"/&gt;  For the women who are able to gain employment, they then face the possibility of being forced to sign a contract prohibiting them from getting pregnant or married during their period of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Fang. "Equal opportunity? The role of legislation and public policies in women's employment in China", Women In Management Review, Vol. 16, No. 7 (2001): 334–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Feminine" jobs and professions===
Along with economic reforms in China, gender differences in terms of physical appearance and bodily gestures have been made more paramount through the media and commerce. This has created jobs that demand feminine attributes, particularly in the service industry. Sales representatives in cosmetics and clothing stores are usually young attractive women who continuously cultivate their feminine appearance, corresponding to images of women that they see in advertisements. &lt;ref&gt;Otis, Eileen. (2011). ''Markets and Bodies: Women, service work, and the making of inequality in China''. Stanford University Press.‏&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese women nowadays also dominate other domains of professional training such as psychotherapy. Courses and workshops in psychotherapy attract women of different ages who feel the burden of sensitively mastering social relations in and outside their households and at the same time as a channel to realize themselves as individuals not reduced to their familial roles as mothers or wives.&lt;ref&gt;Hizi, Gil (2018). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14442213.2018.1481881 "Gendered Self-Improvement: Autonomous Personhood and the Marriage Predicament of Young Women in Urban China."] ''The Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology'': 1-18, DOI: 10.1080/14442213.2018.1481881&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Women in politics==
Women in China have low participation rates as political leaders. Women's disadvantage is most evident in
their severe underrepresentation in the more powerful, political, positions.&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt; At the top level of decision making, no woman has ever been among the nine members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo]]. Just 3 of 27 government ministers are women, and importantly, since 1997, China has fallen to 53rd place from 16th in the world in terms of female representation at its parliament, the National People's Congress, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Women Struggle for a Foothold in Chinese Politics | author=Didi Kirsten Tatlow| publisher=New York Times | accessdate = 2010-06-24 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/world/asia/25iht-letter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes against women==

===Foot binding===
{{Main article|Foot binding}}
[[File:Foot binding- wealthy Chinese women.jpg|Women with bound feet, Beijing, 1900|thumb|Women with [[bound feet]] in 1900]]
Following the fall of the Qing dynasty and the end of imperial rule, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican government]] outlawed foot binding in 1912&lt;ref&gt;NPR, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 'Painful Memories of China's Footbinding Survivors], 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and popular attitudes toward the practice began to shift decisively by the 1920s. In 1949 the practice of footbinding was successfully banned.&lt;ref name="foot binding"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=C. Fred|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor|journal=Signs|year=1994|volume=19|issue=3|pages=676–712|jstor=3174774|doi=10.1086/494917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today bound feet act as a reminder of the past "oppression of women, insularity, despotism, and disregard for human rights."&lt;ref name=Cinderella&gt;{{cite book|last=Ko|first=Dorothy|title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|year=2005|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking===
{{Main article| Human trafficking in the People's Republic of China}}
Young women and girls are kidnapped from their homes and sold to gangs who traffick women, often displacing the women by great distances.&lt;ref&gt;Susan W. Tiefenbrun and Susan W. Tiefenbrun. 2008."Gendercide and the cultural context of sex trafficking in china" ExpressO. Retrieved from [http://works.bepress.com/susan_tiefenbrun/2] (accessed on 12 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that the women do not run away, the men who purchase them do not allow the women to leave the house.&lt;ref name="trafficking"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feingold|first=David A.|title=Human Trafficking|journal=Foreign Policy|date=September–October 2005|issue=150|pages=26–30|jstor=30048506}} (accessed on 25 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Oftentimes the documentation and papers are taken from the trafficked women.&lt;ref name="trafficking"/&gt; Many women become pregnant and have children, and are burdened to provide for their family.&lt;ref name="trafficking"/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Mao Zedong]], the first Chairman of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of China]], launched a campaign to eradicate prostitution throughout China. The campaign made the act of trafficking women severely punishable by law.&lt;ref name=Ditmore&gt;{{cite book|last=Ditmore|first=Melissa Hope|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volume 2|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|pages=438–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major component of the campaign was the [[Vocational rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] program in which prostitutes and trafficked women were provided "medical treatment, thought reform, job training, and family reintegration."&lt;ref name="Ditmore"/&gt; Since the economic reform in 1979, sex trafficking and other social vices have revived.&lt;ref name="Ditmore"/&gt;

===Prostitution===
{{Main article|Prostitution in the People's Republic of China}}
Shortly after taking power in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] embarked upon a series of campaigns that purportedly eradicated [[prostitution]] from [[mainland China]] by the early 1960s.  Since the loosening of government controls over society in the early 1980s, prostitution in mainland China not only has become more visible, but also can now be found throughout both [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] areas. In spite of government efforts, prostitution has now developed to the extent that it comprises an [[industry]], one that involves a great number of people and produces a considerable economic [[Output (economics)|output]].

Prostitution has also become associated with a number of problems, including [[organized crime]], [[government corruption]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. As the Chinese favor a son more than girls in the family, there is a disproportional larger marriageable aged men with no prospects for finding enough women, they also turn to prostitutes. This is accentuated by many married men and wives who do not live in one city together and they turn to "consultants" for help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">'''Yabaku''' is a fairly enigmatic tribe out of ten prominent Türkic tribes enumerated by [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmut Kashgari]] (11th century) in the list describing the location of the Türkic polities from the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] to the borders of China in the following sequence: i. [[Pechenegs|Bechen]] ([[Pechenegs|Badjinak]], hence their Greek designation "''Patzinakae''"), ii. Kyfchak ([[Kipchak people|Kipchak]], actually [[Cumans]] then roaming in the Russian steppe and modern Ukraine), iii. [[Oghuz Turks|Oguz]] (linguistic kin to Turkey's and Azerbaijan's Turks, then still north of Aral, and between [[Aral Sea|Aral]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]), iv. [[Kimek|Yemek]] ([[Kimek]] then in the [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]] vicinity), v. Bashgyrt ([[Bashkirs|Bashkort]], in modern [[Bashkortostan]]), vi. [[Basmyl]], vii. [[Kayı tribe|Kai]], viii. Yabaku, ix. [[Tatars]], x. [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (linguistic kin also to modern Kazakh, as well as the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]). Kashgari also noted that "the Kai, ''Yabaku'', Tatar, and Basmyl are bilingual, speaking in Türkic alongside their own languages, while Kyrgyzes, Kyfchaks, Oguzes..." have their own "Türkic" languages, and the languages of Yemeks and [[Bashkirs|Bashkirts]] are close to them.&lt;ref&gt;M.Zakiev, ''"Origin of Türks and Tatars"'', p.69, 192, Moscow, "Insan", 2002, {{ISBN|5-85840-317-4}} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zazpiak Bat''' is a [[heraldic]] nickname for the Basque [[coat of arms]] which includes the arms of the seven provinces mentioned, stressing their unity. It was designed by the historian Jean de Jaurgain in 1897 for the ''Congrès et Fêtes de la Tradition basque'' celebrated at [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]. 

==Name==
''Zazpiak Bat'' is a motto attributed to [[Basque people|Basque]] [[explorer]] [[Antoine-Thomson d'Abbadie]] in the late nineteenth century, from the [[Basque language|Basque]] words ''zazpiak'' meaning 'the seven' and ''bat'' meaning 'one', translates as "the seven [are] one" and refers to the seven [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] traditional provinces. However, it was first cited in 1836 by a friend and collaborator of Antoine d'Abbadie's, the [[Soule]]tin [[Agosti Xaho]] (''Etudes grammaticales sur la langue euskarienne'', dedicated to the ''Zazpirak Bat''). The motto is based on a similar one fashioned by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] society [[Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País]] in 1765, ''Irurac bat'', 'the three [are] one', after the provinces currently making up the [[Basque Autonomous Community]]), while a like variant was created too in the 19th century known as ''Laurak bat'' ('the four [are] one', after the four Basque provinces in Spain), a motto quoted and celebrated by the Provincial Government of Navarre in 1866.

==History==
[[File:ETA Pasajes 2003 06 28.jpg|thumb|[[Batasuna]] mural painting in [[Gipuzkoa]] (2003), featuring the modern version of ''Zazpiak Bat'' along with [[arrano beltza]], [[lauburu]], and [[Ikurriña]]]]

The original Zazpiak Bat features a design of traditional arms of six Basque territories, namely [[Álava]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and [[Biscay]] (the three which make the [[Basque Autonomous Community]]) plus [[Navarre]] (both in [[Spain]]); and the two that are part of the French department of the [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]] - [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]]. The coat of arms of the third traditional province, [[Lower Navarre]] is subsumed under the coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], therefore omitted and represented by the latter. The modern design is based on the current simplified heraldry of these territories. 

===Laurak Bat===
{{main|Coat of arms of Basque Country (autonomous community)}}
Laurak Bat with the four Basque provinces in Spain was adopted as the [[Coat of arms of Basque Country (autonomous community)|coat of arms]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous community]]. The [[coat of arms of Navarre]] was originally included in the fourth quarter of the shield, but following a protest from the [[Unión del Pueblo Navarro|UPN]] led government of [[Navarre]], the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] forced the Basque government to remove the chains of Navarre from the Basque insignia. The red background of the Navarrese insignia currently occupies the fourth quarter of the coat of arms of the Basque Country.
