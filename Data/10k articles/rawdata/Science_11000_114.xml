The '''A574''' is a road in [[England]], running through the borough of [[Warrington]] before terminating at the end of Butts Bridge in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]]. The route covers a distance of approximately {{convert|13|mi}}&lt;ref&gt;The AA Route Planner&lt;/ref&gt; and links Warrington town centre with the outer suburbs of Birchwood and Sankey.

The road passes through the following districts of Warrington and Leigh (in route order):
*[[Great Sankey|Sankey Bridges]] (Start of route)
*[[Old Hall]]
*[[Westbrook, Warrington|Westbrook]]
*[[Callands]]
*[[Longford, Warrington|Longford]]

*[[Longbarn]]
*[[Birchwood]]
*Locking Stumps
*[[Risley, Warrington|Risley]]
*[[Culcheth]]
*[[Glazebury]]
*[[Hope Carr]] (End of route)

Being in the new part of Warrington, the road is renowned for its numerous roundabouts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A574 Society for All British Road Enthusiasts, A574 route description]&lt;/ref&gt;—26 in all,&lt;ref&gt;Count of roundabouts on the A574, using maps at Multimap&lt;/ref&gt; the first one less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} from the start and the last about {{convert|1|mi}} from the terminus.&lt;ref&gt;A-Z Warrington and district 1998 Edition (pgs 12/13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A702''' is a major road in [[Scotland]], that runs from [[Edinburgh]] to [[St. John's Town of Dalry]] in [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. It is the last section of a sometimes recommended route by Google Maps between [[London]] and Edinburgh, the English and Scottish capitals, which now follows the [[M1 motorway|M1]], [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[A74(M)]] and A702 roads, rather than the more direct [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[A1 road (Great Britain)#A1.28M.29|A1(M)]] which runs all the way.

==Route of Road==
[[File:Tollcross, Edinburgh (composite).jpg|thumb|right|The start of the A702 at the Tollcross junction in central Edinburgh.  The road heads off to the left of the photograph.]]
[[File:Dalry A702&amp;A713 June2009 2.JPG|thumb|right|The end of the A702 in [[St John's Town of Dalry]].]]
The A702 begins as a minor street heading north as Ponton Street from its junction with West Tolcross, then turning east into Fountainbridge, and south into Earl Grey Street where it [[concurrency (road)|overlaps]] with the [[A700 road|A700]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking directions to Home St/A702|url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Ponton+St%2FA702&amp;daddr=55.9445542,-3.2057111+to:Home+St%2FA702&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.944092,-3.205529&amp;spn=0.002388,0.004903&amp;sll=55.943901,-3.204489&amp;sspn=0.003377,0.009806&amp;geocode=FbCgVQMduRbP_w%3BFWqlVQMdsRXP_yk13OirmMeHSDGlWlrPo5DQwA%3BFbKfVQMdjB3P_w&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=17&amp;via=1&amp;z=18|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2013 it is not possible to drive this {{convert|0.3|mi|adj=on}} section continuously due to opposing one-way systems.

It starts as a [[primary route]] at the Tollcross junction in [[Edinburgh]], and continues south until it meets the [[Edinburgh City Bypass]] (A720) on the city's outskirts. In the city is known as Home Street, Leven Street, Bruntsfield Place, Morningside Road, Comiston Road and finally Biggar Road. It continues in a south-westerly direction through the Pentland Hills to [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]], before following the [[River Clyde|Clyde Valley]].  The route is a major commuter route for residents of [[Carlops]], [[West Linton]] and [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] who work in and around the Edinburgh area.  The road passes through the villages of [[Coulter, Lanarkshire|Coulter]] and Lamington, before meeting the [[A73 road (Great Britain)|A73 road]] at a new [[roundabout]] junction, and then shortly afterwards meets junction 13 of the [[M74 motorway|M74]]. From [[Abington, South Lanarkshire|Abington]], it continues as a non-primary route, and [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s the [[A76 road (Great Britain)|A76 road]] for 1½ miles until [[Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway|Thornhill]]. From Thornhill, the road winds south-west still, through the village of [[Moniaive]], until eventually reaching [[St. John's Town of Dalry]]. Here, it terminates at its junction with the [[A713 road]].

The A702 from junction 13 of the M74 is the recommended route to Edinburgh, whereas the windier [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7 road]] is signed as the Tourist Route to Edinburgh.  The route attracts a large number of lorries and heavy goods vehicles and even though it includes some reasonably straight sections suitable for overtaking it can be a slow route from the M74 to Edinburgh. One other possible route to Edinburgh for those prepared to enjoy their driving more is the [[A701 road]] via [[Moffat]].

The stretch of the A702 between Abington and Edinburgh was formerly part of the [[Euroroute]] system, of route E32.  The E32 also ran northwards out of Edinburgh along the [[A90 road|A90]]/[[M90 motorway|M90]] as far as [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].

'''Alain-Edgard Berton''' (1912-1979) was a French chemical engineer who specialized in [[toxicology]] and in the analysis of air components in industrial environments. In the late 1950s he invented the "Osmopile",&lt;ref&gt;Google books, ''Chimie &amp; industrie'', Volume 86, Camille Matignon, Société de chimie industrielle, 1961 [https://books.google.fr/books?ei=9g-ZVa7uHojdUdfYkNgM&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=hgYkAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Alain+Berton%22+nous+a+quitt%C3%A9&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Alain+Berton%22+]&lt;/ref&gt; a measuring device, dubbed "the first artificial nose," which initiated, through the use of highly sensitive galvanic cells, the [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] analysis of air to detect dangerous components.

== Biography ==
Alain Berton was born in [[Coro Coro, Bolivia|Coro Coro]] [[Coro Coro, Bolivia| ]] in [[Bolivia]] on 27 August 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Google books [https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;id=qBkMAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Berton+%28Alain%29%22 ''Who is Who in France''].&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Adrien Berton, a mining engineer, and Justine Rodriguez. He was educated at the [[Lycée Hoche]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], and became a chemical engineer at [[Chimie ParisTech|the Chemical Institute of the University of Paris]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lebeau, ''Les hautes températures et leurs utilisations en chimie Publisher'', Masson et Cie, year 1950, volume 1 Google books [https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;id=SF3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Alain+Berton%2C+Ing%C3%A9nieur+Chimiste+de+l%27Institut+de+Chimie+de+l%27Universit%C3%A9+de+Paris%22 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PL"&gt;Paul Lebeau, [https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;id=SF3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Ramsay%22 ''Les hautes températures et leurs utilisations en chimie''], vol. I, Masson et Cie, 1950, page xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1937 he was a [[William Ramsay|Ramsay Fellow]] at the [[Institute of Technology]] in London, in the laboratory of Prof. [[William Lawrence Bragg]], at the [[Royal Institution]]. He began his career in 1938 at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]] as a "boursier" (fellow) in [[Georges Urbain]]'s laboratory (dedicated to war chemical studies, protection against poison gas).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=psDQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Alain+Berton+%22&amp;dq=%22Alain+Berton+%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D1uYVemAMsnbUdnxpegN&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw ''Chimie analytique'', Volume 47, Partie 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallica bnf [http://gallica.bnf.fr/Search?ArianeWireIndex=index&amp;p=1&amp;lang=FR&amp;q=%22Alain+Berton%22 ''Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences''].&lt;/ref&gt; Following Georges Urbain's death that same year, he was assigned to [[Paul Lebeau]]'s laboratory as "chargé de recherche" (researcher).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lebeau, ''Les hautes températures et leurs utilisations en chimie'', vol. I, Masson et Cie, 1950, page xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1959 till 1969 he was head of research.&lt;ref&gt;Persée.fr [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/psy_0003-5033_1963_num_63_2_27789 Détection olfactive et détection physique des vapeurs odorantes, Guilot, Berton, 1963].&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, from 1959 to 1978, he was head of the Toxicology Laboratory for the Regional Social Security Fund in Paris.

== The Osmopile ==
By the end of the [[World War II|war]] in 1944, post war recovery started: Alain Berton's work on the application of [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption and emission spectroscopy]] in the [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]],&lt;ref&gt;Worlcatalog [http://www.worldcat.org/title/spectres-dabsorption-par-reflexion-de-substances-en-poudre-dans-le-visible-et-lultraviolet/oclc/016728836 Spectres d’absorption par réflexion de substances en poudre, dans le visible et l’ultraviolet]?&lt;/ref&gt; and within the frame of concerns about labor force protection, the specific dosage of atmospheric pollutants became of vital interest in factories to effectively detect and remedy industrial pollution. Thus, in the 1950s, based on the method of [[gas chromatography]] analysis by low temperature followed by [[pyrolysis]], he managed to isolate chlorinated substances and acid vapors components in the air. He was able to individualize traces of gas and vapors by using ultra-sensitive galvanic batteries and galvanic microcell detectors.&lt;ref&gt;Gallica [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3185k/f650.image.r=alain%20berton.langFR Spectrochimie].&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his research in the preamble to the convention of the [[Analytical Chemistry]] Group in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Alain+Berton+%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5 citations].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Google books [https://books.google.fr/books?id=YavPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA48&amp;dq=%22Alain+Berton+%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D1uYVemAMsnbUdnxpegN&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alain%20Berton%20%22&amp;f=false Un photomètre ultra sensible].&lt;/ref&gt; Alain Berton named his invention "the Osmopile," later nicknamed "the sniffing cells" by the [[scientific journal]] ''Atomes''.&lt;ref&gt;Les osmopiles, les piles qui sentent, ''Atomes, la revue d’information et de culture scientifique générale'', numéro 192, novembre 1962 [http://sciences.gloubik.info/spip.php?article422].&lt;/ref&gt; The first "artificial nose" was thus born. His invention was adopted and developed in the US&lt;ref&gt;"The Chemical-Senses" by Moncrieff,  publisher Hill, edition 3, 1967 [https://books.google.fr/books?ei=TGmXVdKtIsviUabimzg&amp;id=B-5qAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Berton%22%2B%22osmopile%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Berton%22].&lt;/ref&gt; and went around the world with a report from the [[Associated Press]] dated December 8, 1958.

Berton’s Osmopile was marketed by Jouan, a laboratory equipment manufacturer founded in the 1940s by a researcher from the [[Pasteur Institute]] and acquired in 2003 by [[Thermo Electron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/24/09/2003/LesEchos/18995-128-ECH_jouan-rachete-par-son-concurrent-americain-thermo-electron.htm Les Echos]&lt;/ref&gt; The Osmopile device was modernized over time and used in the fight against industrial [[pollution]].
 
Through his invention, Alain Berton proved to be an [[Political ecology|ecology pioneer]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallica [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61239179/f279.image.r=osmopile.langEN ''Annales de la Société Entomologique de France''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallica [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5673563j/f89.image.r=osmopile.langEN ''Comptes rendus de séances de l’Académie des Sciences'', 1982].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue BNF [http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/RechercheEquation?TexteCollection=HGARSTUVWXYZ1DIECBMJNQLOKP&amp;TexteTypeDoc=DESNFPIBTMCJOV&amp;Equation=IDP%3Dcb33876738p&amp;FormatAffichage=0&amp;host=catalogue Extrait de ''Chimie analytique'', N° 3, mars 1957, Commissariat à l’énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (France)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture (AIRCA)''' is an international, non-profit alliance focused on increasing [[food security]] by supporting smallholder agriculture and rural enterprise within healthy, sustainable and climate-smart landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2013|title=WHITE PAPER Transforming rural livelihoods and landscapes: sustainable improvements to incomes, food security and the environment|url=http://www.airca.org/docs/AIRCA_White_Paper_Landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture|isbn=978-92-95098-31-2|author1=Nicholls T.|author2=Elouafi, I.|author3=Borgemeister, C.|author4=Campos-Arce, J.J.|author5=Hermann, M.|author6=Hoogendoorn, J.|author7=Keatinge, J.D.H.|author8=Kelemu, S.|author9=Molden, D.J.|author10=Roy, A.|display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview and focus ==
AIRCA unites nine international&amp;nbsp;[[agricultural research]]&amp;nbsp;and development centers which focus on a diverse mix of commodities, crops and issues including tropical agriculture, vegetable production, bamboo and rattan, insect pests, fertilizer use, underutilized crops, biosaline agriculture and sustainable development in mountains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenink.co.uk/sites/default/documents/newsletters/new_leaf_february_14_full.html#article6|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728133806/http://www.greenink.co.uk/sites/default/documents/newsletters/new_leaf_february_14_full.html#article6|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-07-28|title=New Leaf - Birth of a research association|date=February 2014|publisher=Green Ink|accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of AIRCA address sustainable agriculture and the environment at the [[Landscape ecology|landscape]] level. The centers create solutions that take into account the diversity of interactions among people and the environment, agricultural and non-agricultural systems, the crossing of national boundaries and other factors that represent the entire context of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gfar.net/news/healthy-soil-foundation-healthy-people-and-landscapes|title=Healthy soil: the foundation for healthy people and landscapes|website=GFAR - The Global Forum on Agricultural Research|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIRCA members serve more than 60 countries comprising over 70% of the world’s population from across the Americas,&amp;nbsp;Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landscapes.org/a-new-alliance-with-a-focus-on-sustainable-landscapes/|title=A new alliance with a focus on sustainable landscapes - Global Landscapes Forum|website=Global Landscapes Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad alliance has collective access to a wide variety of crops and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/biodiversity/news/global-alliance-to-strengthen-research-farmer-links.html|title=Global alliance to strengthen research–farmer links|last=|website=SciDev.Net|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined resources of AIRCA can be used to achieve 10 of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|website=United Nations Sustainable Development|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airca.org/index.php/airca-resources/airca-s-response-to-the-sdgs|title=How AIRCA can help to achieve SDGs|website=AIRCA|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to CGIAR and FAO ==
AIRCA member organizations work with crops of high economic, social, nutritional and ecological value. This complements and contrasts with the work of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[CGIAR]] who work primarily in staple crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/305922/Session%20Brief%20P2-2%20AIRCA-DO.pdf|title=Second Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development - Breakout sessions P2.2 Land, Water, Forests and Landscapes - Speaker Brief|last2=Nichols|first2=Trevor|date=|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|first1=Sarah|last1=Simons|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIRCA does have some overlap with the CGIAR, however the CGIAR generally focuses more on agricultural research while AIRCA has more of a concentration on the implementation of agricultural research and [[development communication]].&lt;ref name="ramakrishna1" /&gt; AIRCA has a strong orientation toward problem solving at a system level, rather than a focus on a single commodity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gfar.net/newsletters/fri-30032012-0244|title=New association to foster work of international agricultural research centers|website=GFAR - The Global Forum on Agricultural Research|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
AIRCA was launched on 2 March 2012 at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It was publicly presented in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on 30 October 2012 during the second [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research|Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development]].&lt;ref name="ramakrishna1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Akkinapally |last=Ramakrishna |url=http://www.nari.org.pg/node/228 |title=Strengthening research–farmer links in developing countries |publisher=Nari.org.pg |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the cantilever is displaced via its interaction with the surface, so too will the reflection of the laser beam be displaced on the surface of the photodiode.]]
'''Atomic force microscopy''' ('''AFM''') or '''scanning force microscopy''' ('''SFM''') is a very-high-resolution type of [[scanning probe microscopy]] (SPM), with demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a [[nanometer]], more than 1000 times better than the [[diffraction limited|optical diffraction limit]].

==Overview==
[[Image:Atomic force microscope by Zureks.jpg|thumb|right|240px| An atomic force microscope on the left with controlling computer on the right.]]
AFM is a type of [[scanning probe microscopy]] (SPM), with demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a [[nanometer]], more than 1000 times better than the [[diffraction limited|optical diffraction limit]]. The information is gathered by "feeling" or "touching" the surface with a mechanical probe.
[[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] elements that facilitate tiny but accurate and precise movements on (electronic) command enable precise scanning.

===Abilities===
[[File:Atomic Force Microscope.ogg|thumb|250 px|upright=1.5|Atomic Force Microscope]]
The AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and manipulation.

In force measurement, AFMs can be used to measure the forces between the probe and the sample as a function of their mutual separation. This can be applied to perform [[force spectroscopy]], to measure the mechanical properties of the sample, such as the sample's [[Young's modulus]], a measure of stiffness.

For imaging, the reaction of the probe to the forces that the sample imposes on it can be used to form an image of the three-dimensional shape (topography) of a sample surface at a high resolution. This is achieved by raster scanning the position of the sample with respect to the tip and recording the height of the probe that corresponds to a constant probe-sample interaction (see section topographic imaging in AFM for more details). The surface topography is commonly displayed as a [[pseudocolor]] plot.

In manipulation, the forces between tip and sample can also be used to change the properties of the sample in a controlled way. Examples of this include atomic manipulation, [[scanning probe lithography]] and local stimulation of cells.

Simultaneous with the acquisition of topographical images, other properties of the sample can be measured locally and displayed as an image, often with similarly high resolution. Examples of such properties are mechanical properties like stiffness or adhesion strength and electrical properties such as conductivity or surface potential. In fact, the majority of [[Scanning probe microscopy|SPM]] techniques are extensions of AFM that use this modality.

===Other microscopy technologies===
The major difference between atomic force microscopy and competing technologies such as optical microscopy and electron microscopy is that AFM does not use lenses or beam irradiation.  Therefore, it does not suffer from a limitation in spatial resolution due to diffraction and aberration, and preparing a space for guiding the beam (by creating a vacuum) and staining the sample are not necessary.

There are several types of scanning microscopy including [[scanning probe microscopy]] (which includes AFM, [[Scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM) and [[near-field scanning optical microscope]] (SNOM/NSOM), [[STED microscopy]] (STED), and [[scanning electron microscopy]] and [[Electrochemical AFM]], EC-AFM). Although SNOM and STED use [[visible light|visible]], [[infrared]] or even [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] light to illuminate the sample, their resolution is not constrained by the diffraction limit.

===Configuration===
Fig. 3 shows an AFM, which typically consists of the following features.&lt;ref name="Biningpat"&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US4724318 Patent US4724318 - Atomic force microscope and method for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers in parentheses correspond to numbered features in Fig. 3. Coordinate directions are defined by the coordinate system (0).
[[File:AFM conf.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 3:''' Typical configuration of an AFM.&lt;br&gt;
'''(1)''': Cantilever, 
'''(2)''': Support for cantilever, 
'''(3)''': Piezoelectric element(to oscillate cantilever at its eigen frequency.), 
'''(4)''': Tip (Fixed to open end of a cantilever, acts as the probe), 
'''(5)''': Detector of deflection and motion of the cantilever, 
'''(6)''': Sample to be measured by AFM, 
'''(7)''': xyz drive, (moves sample (6) and stage (8) in x, y, and z directions with respect to a tip apex (4)), and
'''(8)''': Stage.]]

The small spring-like [[cantilever]] (1) is carried by the support (2). Optionally, a piezoelectric element (typically made of a ceramic material) (3) oscillates  the cantilever (1). The sharp tip (4) is fixed to the free end of the cantilever (1). The detector (5) records the deflection and motion of the cantilever (1). The sample (6) is mounted on the sample stage (8).  An xyz drive (7) permits to displace the sample (6) and the sample stage (8) in x, y, and z directions with respect to the tip apex (4). Although Fig. 3 shows the drive attached to the sample, the drive can also be attached to the tip, or independent drives can be attached to both, since it is the relative displacement of the sample and tip that needs to be controlled. Controllers and plotter are not shown in Fig. 3.

According to the configuration described above, the interaction between tip and sample, which can be an atomic scale phenomenon, is transduced into changes of the motion of cantilever which is a macro scale phenomenon. Several different aspects of the cantilever motion can be used to quantify the interaction between the tip and sample, most commonly the value of the deflection, the amplitude of an imposed oscillation of the cantilever, or the shift in resonance frequency of the cantilever (see section Imaging Modes).

====Detector====
The detector (5) of AFM measures the deflection (displacement with respect to the equilibrium position) of the cantilever and converts it into an electrical signal. The intensity of this signal will be proportional to the displacement of the cantilever.

Various methods of detection can be used, e.g. interferometry, optical levers, the piezoresistive method, the piezoelectric method, and STM-based detectors (see section "AFM cantilever deflection measurement".).

====Image formation====
''Note: The following paragraphs assume that 'contact mode' is used (see section Imaging Modes). For other imaging modes, the process is similar, except that 'deflection' should be replaced by the appropriate feedback variable.''

When using the AFM to image a sample, the tip is brought into contact with the sample, and the sample is raster scanned along an x-y grid (fig 4). Most commonly, an electronic feedback loop is employed to keep the probe-sample force constant during scanning. This feedback loop has the cantilever deflection as input, and its output controls the distance along the z axis between the probe support (2 in fig. 3) and the sample support (8 in fig 3). As long as the tip remains in contact with the sample, and the sample is scanned in the x-y plane, height variations in the sample will change the deflection of the cantilever. The feedback then adjusts the height of the probe support so that the deflection is restored to a user-defined value (the setpoint). A properly adjusted feedback loop adjusts the support-sample separation continuously during the scanning motion, such that the deflection remains approximately constant. In this situation, the feedback output equals the sample surface topography to within a small error.

Historically, a different operation method has been used, in which the sample-probe support distance is kept constant and not controlled by a feedback ([[Servomechanism|servo mechanism]]). In this mode, usually referred to as 'constant height mode', the deflection of the cantilever is recorded as a function of the sample x-y position. As long as the tip is in contact with the sample, the deflection then corresponds to surface topography. The main reason this method is not very popular anymore, is that the forces between tip and sample are not controlled, which can lead to forces high enough to damage the tip or the sample. It is however common practice to record the deflection even when scanning in 'constant force mode', with feedback. This reveals the small tracking error of the feedback, and can sometimes reveal features that the feedback was not able to adjust for.

The AFM signals, such as sample height or cantilever deflection, are recorded on a computer during the x-y scan. They are plotted in a [[pseudocolor]] image, in which each pixel represents an x-y position on the sample, and the color represents the recorded signal.

===History===
The AFM was invented by IBM scientists in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ibms-35-atoms-and-the-rise-of-nanotech/|title=IBM's 35 atoms and the rise of nanotech|work=CNET|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precursor to the AFM, the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM), was developed by [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] in the early 1980s at [[IBM Research - Zurich]], a development that earned them the 1986 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]]. Binnig invented&lt;ref name="Biningpat" /&gt; the atomic force microscope and the first experimental implementation was made by Binnig, [[Calvin Quate|Quate]] and [[Christoph Gerber|Gerber]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binnig | first1 = G. | last2 = Quate | first2 = C. F. | last3 = Gerber | first3 = C. | year = 1986 | title = Atomic Force Microscope | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 56 | issue = 9| pages = 930–933 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.56.930|bibcode = 1986PhRvL..56..930B | pmid=10033323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially available atomic force microscope was introduced in 1989. The AFM is one of the foremost tools for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the [[nanometre|nanoscale]].

===Applications===
The AFM has been applied to problems in a wide range of disciplines of the natural sciences, including [[solid-state physics]], [[semiconductor]] science and technology, [[molecular engineering]], [[polymer chemistry]] and [[Polymer physics|physics]], [[Surface science|surface chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology]], and [[medicine]].

Applications in the field of solid state physics include (a) the identification of atoms at a surface, (b) the evaluation of interactions between a specific atom and its neighboring atoms, and (c) the study of changes in physical properties arising from changes in an atomic arrangement through atomic manipulation.

In molecular biology, AFM can be used to study the structure and mechanical properties of protein complexes and assemblies. For example, AFM has been used to image [[microtubules]] and measure their stiffness.

In cellular biology, AFM can be used to attempt to distinguish cancer cells and normal cells based on a hardness of cells, and to evaluate interactions between a specific cell and its neighboring cells in a competitive culture system. AFM can also be used to indent cells, to study how they regulate the stiffness or shape of the cell membrane or wall.

In some variations, [[electric potential]]s can also be scanned using conducting [[cantilever]]s.

The AFM consists of a [[cantilever]] with a sharp tip (probe) at its end that is used to scan the specimen surface. The cantilever is typically [[silicon]] or [[silicon nitride]] with a tip [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] on the order of nanometers. When the tip is brought into proximity of a sample surface, [[force]]s between the tip and the sample lead to a deflection of the cantilever according to [[Hooke's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cappella |first=B |author2=Dietler, G |journal=[[Surface Science Reports]] |year=1999 |volume=34 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–104 |doi=10.1016/S0167-5729(99)00003-5 |url=http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~vkoutsos/Force-distance%20curves%20by%20atomic%20force%20microscopy.pdf |bibcode=1999SurSR..34....1C |title=Force-distance curves by atomic force microscopy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203031934/http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~vkoutsos/Force-distance%20curves%20by%20atomic%20force%20microscopy.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the situation, forces that are measured in AFM include mechanical contact force, [[van der Waals force]]s, [[Capillarity|capillary forces]], [[chemical bond]]ing, [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], magnetic forces (see [[magnetic force microscope]], MFM), [[Casimir effect|Casimir forces]], [[solvation|solvation forces]], etc. Along with force, additional quantities may simultaneously be measured through the use of specialized types of probes (see [[scanning thermal microscopy]], [[scanning joule expansion microscopy]], [[photothermal microspectroscopy]], etc.).

The image space is (x,y,z) = (20&amp;nbsp;µm&amp;nbsp;× 20&amp;nbsp;µm&amp;nbsp;× 420&amp;nbsp;nm).]]
The AFM can be operated in a number of modes, depending on the application.  In general, possible imaging modes are divided into static (also called ''contact'') modes and a variety of dynamic (non-contact or "tapping") modes where the cantilever is vibrated or oscillated at a given frequency.&lt;ref name="BinnigQuate1986" /&gt;

===Imaging modes===
AFM operation is usually described as one of three modes, according to the nature of the tip motion: contact mode, also called static mode (as opposed to the other two modes, which are called dynamic modes); tapping mode, also called intermittent contact, AC mode, or vibrating mode, or, after the detection mechanism, amplitude modulation AFM; non-contact mode, or, again after the detection mechanism, frequency modulation AFM.

It should be noted that despite the nomenclature, repulsive contact can occur or be avoided both in amplitude modulation AFM and frequency modulation AFM, depending on the settings.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====Contact mode====
In contact mode, the tip is "dragged" across the surface of the sample and the contours of the surface are measured either using the deflection of the cantilever directly or, more commonly, using the feedback signal required to keep the cantilever at a constant position. Because the measurement of a static signal is prone to noise and drift, low stiffness cantilevers (i.e. cantilevers with a low spring constant, k) are used to achieve a large enough deflection signal while keeping the interaction force low. Close to the surface of the sample, attractive forces can be quite strong, causing the tip to "snap-in" to the surface. Thus, contact mode AFM is almost always done at a depth where the overall force is repulsive, that is, in firm "contact" with the solid surface.

====Tapping mode====
[[Image:Single-Molecule-Under-Water-AFM-Tapping-Mode.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Single polymer chains (0.4 nm thick) recorded in a tapping mode under aqueous media with different pH.&lt;ref name=roiter&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0558239|date=Nov 2005|author1=Roiter, Y |author2=Minko, S |title=AFM single molecule experiments at the solid-liquid interface: in situ conformation of adsorbed flexible polyelectrolyte chains|volume=127|issue=45|pages=15688–9|issn=0002-7863|pmid=16277495|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In ambient conditions, most samples develop a liquid meniscus layer.  Because of this, keeping the probe tip close enough to the sample for short-range forces to become detectable while preventing the tip from sticking to the surface presents a major problem for contact mode in ambient conditions.  Dynamic contact mode (also called intermittent contact, AC mode or tapping mode) was developed to bypass this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2584(93)90906-Y|title=Fractured polymer/silica fiber surface studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy|first4=V|last4=Elings|first3=K|last3=Kjoller|first2=D|year=1993|last2=Inniss|author=Zhong, Q|journal=[[Surface Science Reports|Surface Science Letters]]|volume=290|issue=1|pages=L688|bibcode = 1993SurSL.290L.688Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, tapping mode is the most frequently used AFM mode when operating in ambient conditions or in liquids.

In ''tapping mode'', the cantilever is driven to oscillate up and down at or near its resonance frequency. This oscillation is commonly achieved with a small piezo element in the cantilever holder, but other possibilities include an AC magnetic field (with magnetic cantilevers), piezoelectric cantilevers, or periodic heating with a modulated laser beam. The amplitude of this oscillation usually varies from several nm to  200&amp;nbsp;nm. In tapping mode, the frequency and amplitude of the driving signal are kept constant, leading to a constant amplitude of the cantilever oscillation as long as there is no drift or interaction with the surface. The interaction of forces acting on the cantilever when the tip comes close to the surface, [[Van der Waals force]]s, [[dipole-dipole interaction]]s, [[electrostatic force]]s, etc. cause the amplitude of the cantilever's oscillation to change (usually decrease) as the tip gets closer to the sample. This amplitude is used as the parameter that goes into the [[Servomechanism|electronic servo]] that controls the height of the cantilever above the sample. The servo adjusts the height to maintain a set cantilever oscillation amplitude as the cantilever is scanned over the sample. A ''tapping AFM'' image is therefore produced by imaging the force of the intermittent contacts of the tip with the sample surface.&lt;ref name="Geisse 2009 40–45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geisse|first=Nicholas A.|title=AFM and Combined Optical Techniques|journal=[[Materials Today]]|date=July–August 2009|volume=12|issue=7–8|pages=40–45|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(09)70201-9|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702109702019|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the peak forces applied during the contacting part of the oscillation can be much higher than typically used in contact mode, tapping mode generally lessens the damage done to the surface and the tip compared to the amount done in contact mode. This can be explained by the short duration of the applied force, and because the lateral forces between tip and sample are significantly lower in tapping mode over contact mode.
Tapping mode imaging is gentle enough even for the visualization of supported [[Lipid bilayer#Characterization methods|lipid bilayers]] or adsorbed single polymer molecules (for instance, 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm thick chains of synthetic polyelectrolytes) under liquid medium. With proper scanning parameters, the conformation of [[Single-molecule experiment|single molecules]] can remain unchanged for hours,&lt;ref name=roiter/&gt; and even single molecular motors can be imaged while moving.

When operating in tapping mode, the phase of the cantilever's oscillation with respect to the driving signal can be recorded as well. This signal channel contains information about the energy dissipated by the cantilever in each oscillation cycle. Samples that contain regions of varying stiffness or with different adhesion properties can give a contrast in this channel that is not visible in the topographic image. Extracting the sample's material properties in a quantitative manner from phase images, however, is often not feasible.

====Non-contact mode====

In [[non-contact atomic force microscopy]] mode, the tip of the cantilever does not contact the sample surface. The cantilever is instead oscillated at either its [[Resonance|resonant frequency]] (frequency modulation) or just above (amplitude modulation) where the amplitude of oscillation is typically a few nanometers (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;nm) down to a few picometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=L.|author2=Mohn, F.|author3= Moll, N.|author4= Liljeroth, P.|author5= Meyer, G.|title=The Chemical Structure of a Molecule Resolved by Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=27 August 2009|volume=325|issue=5944|pages=1110–1114|doi=10.1126/science.1176210|bibcode = 2009Sci...325.1110G|pmid=19713523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[van der Waals forces]], which are strongest from 1&amp;nbsp;nm to 10&amp;nbsp;nm above the surface, or any other long-range force that extends above the surface acts to decrease the resonance frequency of the cantilever. This decrease in resonant frequency combined with the feedback loop system maintains a constant oscillation amplitude or frequency by adjusting the average tip-to-sample distance. Measuring the tip-to-sample distance at each (x,y) data point allows the scanning software to construct a topographic image of the sample surface.

Non-contact mode AFM does not suffer from tip or sample degradation effects that are sometimes observed after taking numerous scans with contact AFM. This makes non-contact AFM preferable to contact AFM for measuring soft samples, e.g. biological samples and organic thin film. In the case of rigid samples, contact and non-contact images may look the same. However, if a few monolayers of [[adsorbed]] fluid are lying on the surface of a rigid sample, the images may look quite different. An AFM operating in contact mode will penetrate the liquid layer to image the underlying surface, whereas in non-contact mode an AFM will oscillate above the adsorbed fluid layer to image both the liquid and surface.

Schemes for dynamic mode operation include [[frequency modulation]] where a [[phase-locked loop]] is used to track the cantilever's resonance frequency and the more common [[amplitude modulation]] with a [[PID controller|servo loop]] in place to keep the cantilever excitation to a defined amplitude.  In frequency modulation, changes in the oscillation frequency provide information about tip-sample interactions.  Frequency can be measured with very high sensitivity and thus the frequency modulation mode allows for the use of very stiff cantilevers.  Stiff cantilevers provide stability very close to the surface and, as a result, this technique was the first AFM technique to provide true atomic resolution in [[ultra-high vacuum]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.949|title=Advances in atomic force microscopy|year=2003|author=Giessibl, Franz J.|journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume=75|pages=949–983|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..949G|arxiv = cond-mat/0305119|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[amplitude]] modulation, changes in the oscillation amplitude or phase provide the feedback signal for imaging.  In amplitude modulation, changes in the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of oscillation can be used to discriminate between different types of materials on the surface.  Amplitude modulation can be operated either in the non-contact or in the intermittent contact regime. In dynamic contact mode, the cantilever is oscillated such that the separation distance between the cantilever tip and the sample surface is modulated.

[[Amplitude]] modulation has also been used in the non-contact regime to image with atomic resolution by using very stiff cantilevers and small amplitudes in an ultra-high vacuum environment.

==Topographic image==
Image formation is a plotting method that produces a color mapping through changing the x-y position of the tip while scanning and recording the measured variable, i.e. the intensity of control signal, to each x-y coordinate. The color mapping shows the measured value corresponding to each coordinate. The image expresses the intensity of a value as a hue. Usually, the correspondence between the intensity of a value and a hue is shown as a color scale in the explanatory notes accompanying the image.

===What is the topographic image of atomic force microscope?===
Operation mode of image forming of the AFM are generally classified into two groups from the viewpoint whether it uses z-Feedback loop (not shown) to maintain the tip-sample distance to keep signal intensity exported by the detector. The first one (using z-Feedback loop), said to be "constant '''XX''' mode" ('''XX''' is something which kept by z-Feedback loop).

Topographic image formation mode is based on abovementioned "constant '''XX''' mode", z-Feedback loop controls the relative distance between the probe and the sample through outputting control signals to keep constant one of frequency, vibration and phase which typically corresponds to the motion of cantilever (for instance, voltage is applied to the Z-piezoelectric element and it moves the sample up and down towards the Z direction.

Details will be explained in the case that especially "constant df mode"(FM-AFM) among AFM as an instance in next section.

===Topographic image of FM-AFM===
When the distance between the probe and the sample is brought to the range where atomic force may be detected, while a cantilever is excited in its natural eigen frequency (f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), a phenomenon occurs that the resonance frequency (f) of the cantilever shifts from its original resonance frequency (natural eigen frequency). In other words, in the range where atomic force may be detected, the frequency shift (df=f-f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) will be observed. So, when the distance between the probe and the sample is in the '''non-contact''' region, the frequency shift increases in negative direction as the distance between the probe and the sample gets smaller.

When the sample has concavity and convexity, the distance between the tip-apex and the sample varies in accordance with the concavity and convexity accompanied with a scan of the sample along x-y direction (without height regulation in z-direction) .  As a result, the frequency shift arises.  The image in which the values of the frequency obtained by a raster scan along the x-y direction of the sample surface are plotted against the x-y coordination of each measurement point is called a constant-height image.

On the other hand, the df may be kept constant by moving the probe upward and downward (See (3) of FIG.5) in z-direction using a negative feedback (by using z-feedback loop) while the raster scan of the sample surface along the x-y direction .  The image in which the amounts of the negative feedback (the moving distance of the probe upward and downward in z-direction) are plotted against the x-y coordination of each measurement point is a topographic image.  In other words, the topographic image is a trace of the tip of the probe regulated so that the df is constant and it may also be considered to be a plot of a constant-height surface of the df.

Therefore, the topographic image of the AFM is not the exact surface morphology itself, but actually the image influenced by the bond-order between the probe and the sample, however, the topographic image of the AFM is considered to reflect the geographical shape of the surface more than the topographic image of a scanning tunnel microscope.

==Force spectroscopy==
Another major application of AFM (besides imaging) is [[force spectroscopy]], the direct measurement of tip-sample interaction forces as a function of the gap between the tip and sample (the result of this measurement is called a force-distance curve). For this method, the AFM tip is extended towards and retracted from the surface as the deflection of the cantilever is monitored as a function of [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] displacement. These measurements have been used to measure nanoscale contacts, [[Chemical bond|atomic bonding]], [[Van der Waals force]]s, and [[Casimir effect|Casimir forces]], [[Solvation|dissolution]] forces in liquids and single molecule stretching and rupture forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmeth871|date=May 2006|author1=Hinterdorfer, P |author2=Dufrêne, Yf |title=Detection and localization of single molecular recognition events using atomic force microscopy|volume=3|issue=5|pages=347–55|issn=1548-7091|pmid=16628204|journal=[[Nature Methods]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, AFM was used to measure, in an aqueous environment, the dispersion force due to polymer adsorbed on the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferrari | first1 = L. | last2 = Kaufmann | first2 = J. | last3 = Winnefeld | first3 = F. | last4 = Plank | first4 = J. | date = Jul 2010 | title = Interaction of cement model systems with superplasticizers investigated by atomic force microscopy, zeta potential, and adsorption measurements | url = | journal = [[J Colloid Interface Sci]] | volume = 347 | issue = 1| pages = 15–24 | doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2010.03.005 | pmid=20356605|bibcode = 2010JCIS..347...15F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forces of the order of a few [[piconewton]]s can now be routinely measured with a vertical distance resolution of better than 0.1 nanometers.  Force spectroscopy can be performed with either static or dynamic modes.  In dynamic modes, information about the cantilever vibration is monitored in addition to the static deflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.surfrep.2005.08.003|year=2005|author1=Butt, H |author2=Cappella, B |author3=Kappl, M |title = Force measurements with the atomic force microscope: Technique, interpretation and applications|journal=Surface Science Reports|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–152|bibcode = 2005SurSR..59....1B |citeseerx=10.1.1.459.3771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with the technique include no direct measurement of the tip-sample separation and the common need for low-stiffness cantilevers, which tend to 'snap' to the surface. These problems are not insurmountable.  An AFM that directly measures the tip-sample separation has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl803298q|title=Ultrastable Atomic Force Microscopy: Atomic-Scale Stability and Registration in Ambient Conditions|year=2009|author1=Gavin M.

By applying a small [[dither]] to the tip, the stiffness (force gradient) of the bond can be measured as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2000.0713|title=Direct measurement of interatomic force gradients using an ultra-low-amplitude atomic force microscope|year=2001|author1=Peter M.

==Identification of individual surface atoms==
The AFM can be used to image and manipulate atoms and structures on a variety of surfaces.  The atom at the apex of the tip "senses" individual atoms on the underlying surface when it forms incipient chemical bonds with each atom.  Because these chemical interactions subtly alter the tip's vibration frequency, they can be detected and mapped. This principle was used to distinguish between atoms of silicon, tin and lead on an alloy surface, by comparing these 'atomic fingerprints' to values obtained from large-scale [[density functional theory]] (DFT) simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature05530|date=Mar 2007|author1=Sugimoto, Y |author2=Pou, P |author3=Abe, M |author4=Jelinek, P |author5=Pérez, R |author6=Morita, S |author7=Custance, O |title=Chemical identification of individual surface atoms by atomic force microscopy|volume=446|issue=7131|pages=64–7|issn=0028-0836|pmid=17330040|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|bibcode = 2007Natur.446...64S |citeseerx=10.1.1.552.6764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trick is to first measure these forces precisely for each type of atom expected in the sample, and then to compare with forces given by DFT simulations. The team found that the tip interacted most strongly with silicon atoms, and interacted 24% and 41% less strongly with tin and lead atoms, respectively.  Thus, each different type of atom can be identified in the matrix as the tip is moved across the surface.

==Probe==
An AFM probe has a sharp tip on the free-swinging end of a [[cantilever]] that is protruding from a holder.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, P. J.;   Miller, R. G.;   Yang, R.; "Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy combined". ''[[Applied Physics Letters]]'', Jun 1988, Vol: 52 Issue:26, p. 2233–2235, {{ISSN|0003-6951}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the [[cantilever]] are in the scale of micrometers. The radius of the tip is usually on the scale of a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers. (Specialized probes exist with much larger end radii, for example probes for indentation of soft materials.) The  cantilever holder, also called holder chip – often 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm by 3.4&amp;nbsp;mm in size – allows the operator to hold the AFM cantilever/probe assembly with tweezers and fit it into the corresponding holder clips on the scanning head of the atomic force microscope.

This device is most commonly called an "AFM probe", but other names include "AFM tip" and "[[cantilever]]" (employing the name of a single part as the name of the whole device). An AFM probe is a particular type of SPM ([[scanning probe microscopy]]) probe.

AFM probes are manufactured with [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS technology]]. Most AFM probes used are made from [[silicon]] (Si), but [[borosilicate glass]] and [[silicon nitride]] are also in use. AFM probes are considered consumables as they are often replaced when the tip apex becomes dull or contaminated or when the cantilever is broken.  They can cost from a couple of tens of dollars up to hundreds of dollars per cantilever for the most specialized cantilever/probe combinations.

Just the tip is brought very close to the surface of the object under investigation, the [[cantilever]] is deflected by the interaction between the tip and the surface, which is what the AFM is designed to measure. A spatial map of the interaction can be made by measuring the deflection at many points on a 2D surface.

Several types of interaction can be detected. Depending on the interaction under investigation, the surface of the tip of the AFM probe needs to be modified with a coating. Among the coatings used are [[gold]] – for [[covalent bonding]] of biological molecules and the detection of their interaction with a surface,&lt;ref&gt;Oscar H. Willemsen, Margot M.E.

The AFM tips is fabricated using silicon micro machining and the precise positioning of the microSQUID loop is done by electron beam lithography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasselbach | first1 = K. | last2 = Ladam | first2 = C. | year = 2008 | title = High resolution magnetic imaging : MicroSQUID Force Microscopy | url = | journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series | volume = 97 | issue = 1| pages = 012330|bibcode =  2008JPhCS..97a2330H|doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/97/1/012330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the cantilevers can also be modified. These coatings are mostly applied in order to increase the reflectance of the cantilever and to improve the deflection signal.

== Forces vs tip geometry==
The forces between the tip and the sample strongly depend on the geometry of the tip. Various studies were exploited in the past years to write the forces as a function of the tip parameters.

Among the different forces between the tip and the sample, the water meniscus forces are highly interesting, both in air and liquid environment. Other forces must be considered, like the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], [[van der Waals force]]s, [[double layer interactions]], [[solvation]] forces, hydration and hydrophobic forces.

===Water Meniscus===
Water meniscus forces are highly interesting for AFM measurements in air. Due to the ambient [[humidity]], a thin layer of water is formed between the tip and the sample during air measumements. The resulting capillary force gives rise to a strong attractive force that pulls the tip onto the surface. In fact, the adhesion force measured between tip and sample in ambient air of finite humidity is usually dominated by capillary forces. As a consequence, it is difficult to pull the tip away from the surface. For soft samples including many polymers and in particular biological materials, the strong adhesive capillary force gives rise to sample degradation and destruction upon imaging in contact mode. Historically, these problems were an important motivation for the development of dynamic imaging in air (e.g. 'tapping mode'). During tapping mode imaging in air, capillary bridges still form. Yet, for suitable imaging conditions, the capillary bridges are formed and broken in every oscillation cycle of the cantilever normal to the surface, as can be inferred from a analysis of cantilever amplitude and phase vs. distance curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zitzler |first1=Lothar |last2=Herminghaus |first2=Stephan |last3=Mugele |first3=Frieder |title=Capillary forces in tapping mode atomic force microscopy |journal=Phys. Rev. B |date=2002 |volume=66 |issue=15 |page=155436 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.66.155436|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/capillary-forces-in-tapping-mode-atomic-force-microscopy(2bea01f0-24f0-48db-b6e7-831df2ef2e33).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, destructive shear forces are largely reduced and soft samples can be investigated.

In order to quantify the equilibrium capillary force, it is necessary to start from the Laplace equation for pressure:

&lt;math&gt;P=\gamma_L( \frac1r_1 +\frac1r_0)\simeq \frac{\gamma_L}{r_{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;

where γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;  is the surface energy and r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are defined in the figure.

The pressure is applied on an area of [[File:Gaofinale.png|thumb|Model for AFM water meniscus.|alt=|350x350px]]

&lt;math&gt;A \simeq 2\pi R \simeq [r_{eff}(1+cos\theta) + h]&lt;/math&gt;

where d, θ , and h are defined in the figure.

The force which pulles together the two surfaces is

&lt;math&gt;F=2\pi R\gamma_L (1+ cos\theta + \frac {h} {r_{eff}})&lt;/math&gt;

The same formula could also be calculated as a function of relative humidity.

Gao &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chao Gao|title=Theory of menisci and its applications|volume=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; calculated formulas for different tip geometries. As an example, the forse decreases by 20% for a conical tip with respect to a spherical tip.

When these forces are calculated, a difference must be made between the wet on dry situation and the wet on wet situation.

For a spherical tip, the force is:

&lt;math&gt;f_m = -2\pi R \gamma_L ( cos\theta + cos\phi ) (1-\frac{dh} {dD})&lt;/math&gt; for dry on wet

&lt;math&gt;f_m = -2\pi R \gamma_L \frac{dr_0} {dD}&lt;/math&gt;for wet on wet

where θ is the contact angle of the dry sphere and φ is the immersed angle, as shown in the figure Also R,h and D are illustrated in the same figure.

For a conical tip, the formula becomes:

&lt;math&gt;f_m = -2\pi R \gamma_L \frac{tan\delta} {cos\delta}( cos\theta + sin\delta )(hD) (1-\frac{dh} {dD})&lt;/math&gt; for dry on wet

&lt;math&gt;f_m = -2\pi R \gamma_L ( \frac1{cos\delta} + sin\delta )(r_0) (\frac{dr_0} {dD})&lt;/math&gt; for wet on wet

where δ is the half cone angle and r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and h are parameters of the meniscus profile.

==AFM cantilever-deflection measurement==

=== Beam-deflection measurement ===
[[Image:AFM beamdetection.png|thumb|350px|AFM beam-deflection detection]]
The most common method for cantilever-deflection measurements is the beam-deflection method. In this method, laser light from a solid-state diode is reflected off the back of the cantilever and collected by a position-sensitive detector (PSD) consisting of two closely spaced [[photodiode]]s, whose output signal is collected by a [[differential amplifier]].
Angular displacement of the cantilever results in one photodiode collecting more light than the other photodiode, producing an output signal (the difference between the photodiode signals normalized by their sum), which is proportional to the deflection of the cantilever. The sensitivity of the beam-deflection method is very high, a noise floor on the order of 10 fm Hz&lt;sup&gt;−{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt; can be obtained routinely in a well-designed system. Although this method is sometimes called the 'optical lever' method, the signal is not amplified if the beam path is made longer. A longer beam path increases the motion of the reflected spot on the photodiodes, but also widens the spot by the same amount due to [[diffraction]], so that the same amount of optical power is moved from one photodiode to the other. The 'optical leverage' (output signal of the detector divided by deflection of the cantilever) is inversely proportional to the [[numerical aperture]] of the beam focusing optics, as long as the focused laser spot is small enough to fall completely on the cantilever. It is also inversely proportional to the length of the cantilever.

The relative popularity of the beam-deflection method can be explained by its high sensitivity and simple operation, and by the fact that cantilevers do not require electrical contacts or other special treatments, and can therefore be fabricated relatively cheaply with sharp integrated tips.

=== Other deflection-measurement methods ===
Many other methods for beam-deflection measurements exist. 
* ''Piezoelectric detection'' – Cantilevers made from [[quartz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giessibl|first=Franz J.|title=High-speed force sensor for force microscopy and profilometry utilizing a quartz tuning fork|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1 January 1998|volume=73|issue=26|page=3956|doi=10.1063/1.122948|bibcode = 1998ApPhL..73.3956G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (such as the [[Non-contact atomic force microscopy#qPlus sensor|qPlus]] configuration), or other [[piezoelectric]] materials can directly detect deflection as an electrical signal. Cantilever oscillations down to 10pm have been detected with this method.
* ''Laser Doppler vibrometry'' – A [[laser Doppler vibrometer]] can be used to produce very accurate deflection measurements for an oscillating cantilever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nishida|first=Shuhei|author2=Kobayashi, Dai|author3= Sakurada, Takeo|author4= Nakazawa, Tomonori|author5= Hoshi, Yasuo|author6= Kawakatsu, Hideki|title=Photothermal excitation and laser Doppler velocimetry of higher cantilever vibration modes for dynamic atomic force microscopy in liquid|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=1 January 2008|volume=79|issue=12|pages=123703–123703–4|doi=10.1063/1.3040500|bibcode = 2008RScI...79l3703N|pmid=19123565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (thus is only used in non-contact mode). This method is expensive and is only used by relatively few groups.
* ''[[Scanning tunneling microscope]]'' (STM) — The first atomic microscope used an STM complete with its own feedback mechanism to measure deflection.&lt;ref name="BinnigQuate1986"/&gt; This method is very difficult to implement, and is slow to react to deflection changes compared to modern methods.
* ''Optical interferometry'' – [[Optical interferometry]] can be used to measure cantilever deflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rugar|first=D.|author2=Mamin, H. J.|author3= Guethner, P.|title=Improved fiber-optic interferometer for atomic force microscopy|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1 January 1989|volume=55|issue=25|page=2588|doi=10.1063/1.101987|bibcode = 1989ApPhL..55.2588R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nanometre scale deflections measured in AFM, the interferometer is running in the sub-fringe regime, thus, any drift in laser power or wavelength has strong effects on the measurement. For these reasons optical interferometer measurements must be done with great care (for example using [[Refractive index|index matching]] fluids between optical fibre junctions), with very stable lasers. For these reasons optical interferometry is rarely used.
* ''Capacitive detection'' – Metal coated cantilevers can form a [[capacitor]] with another contact located behind the cantilever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göddenhenrich|first=T.|title=Force microscope with capacitive displacement detection|journal=[[Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A]]|volume=8|issue=1|page=383|doi=10.1116/1.576401|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deflection changes the distance between the contacts and can be measured as a change in capacitance.
* ''Piezoresistive detection'' – Cantilevers can be fabricated with [[Piezoresistive effect|piezoresistive elements]] that act as a [[strain gauge]]. Using a [[Wheatstone bridge]], strain in the AFM cantilever due to deflection can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giessibl|first=F. J.|author2=Trafas, B. M.|title=Piezoresistive cantilevers utilized for scanning tunneling and scanning force microscope in ultrahigh vacuum|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=1 January 1994|volume=65|issue=6|page=1923|doi=10.1063/1.1145232|bibcode = 1994RScI...65.1923G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not commonly used in vacuum applications, as the piezoresistive detection dissipates energy from the system affecting [[quality factor|Q]] of the resonance.

==Piezoelectric scanners==
AFM scanners are made from [[piezoelectric]] material, which expands and contracts proportionally to an applied voltage. Whether they elongate or contract depends upon the polarity of the voltage applied. Traditionally the tip or sample is mounted on a 'tripod' of three piezo crystals, with each responsible for scanning in the ''x'',''y'' and ''z'' directions.&lt;ref name="BinnigQuate1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binnig|first1=G.|last2=Quate|first2=C. F.|last3=Gerber|first3=Ch.|title=Atomic Force Microscope|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=56|issue=9|year=1986|pages=930–933|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930|pmid=10033323|bibcode = 1986PhRvL..56..930B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the same year as the AFM was invented, a new [[piezoelectric]] scanner, the tube scanner, was developed for use in STM.&lt;ref name="BinnigSmith1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binnig|first1=G.|last2=Smith|first2=D. P. E.|title=Single-tube three-dimensional scanner for scanning tunneling microscopy|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=57|issue=8|year=1986|page=1688|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.1139196|bibcode = 1986RScI...57.1688B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later tube scanners were incorporated into AFMs. The tube scanner can move the sample in the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' directions using a single tube piezo with a single interior contact and four external contacts. An advantage of the tube scanner compared to the original tripod design, is better vibrational isolation, resulting from the higher resonant frequency of the single element construction, in combination with a low resonant frequency isolation stage. A disadvantage is that the ''x''-''y'' motion can cause unwanted ''z'' motion resulting in distortion. Another popular design for AFM scanners is the [[Flexure bearing|flexure]] stage, which uses separate piezos for each axis, and couples them through a flexure mechanism.

Scanners are characterized by their sensitivity, which is the ratio of piezo movement to piezo voltage, i.e., by how much the piezo material extends or contracts per applied volt. Because of differences in material or size, the sensitivity varies from scanner to scanner. Sensitivity varies non-linearly with respect to scan size. Piezo scanners exhibit more sensitivity at the end than at the beginning of a scan. This causes the forward and reverse scans to behave differently and display [[hysteresis]] between the two scan directions.&lt;ref name="analytical1995"/&gt; This can be corrected by applying a non-linear voltage to the piezo electrodes to cause linear scanner movement and calibrating the scanner accordingly.&lt;ref name="analytical1995"/&gt; One disadvantage of this approach is that it requires re-calibration because the precise non-linear voltage needed to correct non-linear movement will change as the piezo ages (see below). This problem can be circumvented by adding a linear sensor to the sample stage or piezo stage to detect the true movement of the piezo. Deviations from ideal movement can be detected by the sensor and corrections applied to the piezo drive signal to correct for non-linear piezo movement. This design is known as a 'closed loop' AFM. Non-sensored piezo AFMs are referred to as 'open loop' AFMs.

The sensitivity of piezoelectric materials decreases exponentially with time. This causes most of the change in sensitivity to occur in the initial stages of the scanner's life. Piezoelectric scanners are run for approximately 48 hours before they are shipped from the factory so that they are past the point where they may have large changes in sensitivity. As the scanner ages, the sensitivity will change less with time and the scanner would seldom require recalibration,&lt;ref name="fospm2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=1998|title=Automatic lateral calibration of tunneling microscope scanners|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=69|issue=9|pages=3268–3276|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.1149091|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#automatic1998|format=PDF|bibcode = 1998RScI...69.3268L }}&lt;/ref&gt; though various manufacturer manuals recommend monthly to semi-monthly calibration of open loop AFMs.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

===Advantages===
AFM has several advantages over the [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM).  Unlike the electron microscope, which provides a two-dimensional projection or a two-dimensional image of a sample, the AFM provides a three-dimensional surface profile.  In addition, samples viewed by AFM do not require any special treatments (such as metal/carbon coatings) that would irreversibly change or damage the sample, and does not typically suffer from charging artifacts in the final image.  While an electron microscope needs an expensive [[vacuum]] environment for proper operation, most AFM modes can work perfectly well in ambient air or even a liquid environment.  This makes it possible to study biological macromolecules and even living organisms.  In principle, AFM can provide higher resolution than SEM.  It has been shown to give true atomic resolution in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and, more recently, in liquid environments.  High resolution AFM is comparable in resolution to [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] and [[transmission electron microscopy]]. AFM can also be combined with a variety of optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques such as fluorescent microscopy of infrared spectroscopy, giving rise to [[Near-field scanning optical microscope|scanning near-field optical microscopy]], [[nano-FTIR]] and further expanding its applicability. Combined AFM-optical instruments have been applied primarily in the biological sciences but have recently attracted strong interest in photovoltaics&lt;ref name="Geisse 2009 40–45"/&gt; and energy-storage research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayache|first=Maurice|last2=Lux|first2=Simon Franz|last3=Kostecki|first3=Robert|date=2015-04-02|title=IR Near-Field Study of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase on a Tin Electrode|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|volume=6|issue=7|pages=1126–1129|doi=10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00263|pmid=26262960|issn=1948-7185}}&lt;/ref&gt; polymer sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollard|first=Benjamin|last2=Raschke|first2=Markus B.|date=2016-04-22|title=Correlative infrared nanospectroscopic and nanomechanical imaging of block copolymer microdomains|url=http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjnano/articles/7/53|journal=Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=605–612|doi=10.3762/bjnano.7.53|issn=2190-4286|pmc=4901903|pmid=27335750}}&lt;/ref&gt; nanotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huth|first=F.|last2=Schnell|first2=M.|last3=Wittborn|first3=J.|last4=Ocelic|first4=N.|last5=Hillenbrand|first5=R.|title=Infrared-spectroscopic nanoimaging with a thermal source|journal=Nature Materials|volume=10|issue=5|pages=352–356|doi=10.1038/nmat3006|pmid=21499314|bibcode = 2011NatMa..10..352H |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bechtel|first=Hans A.|last2=Muller|first2=Eric A.|last3=Olmon|first3=Robert L.|last4=Martin|first4=Michael C.|last5=Raschke|first5=Markus B.|date=2014-05-20|title=Ultrabroadband infrared nanospectroscopic imaging|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7191|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=20|pages=7191–7196|doi=10.1073/pnas.1400502111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4034206|pmid=24803431|bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.7191B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paluszkiewicz|first=C.|last2=Piergies|first2=N.|last3=Chaniecki|first3=P.|last4=Rękas|first4=M.|last5=Miszczyk|first5=J.|last6=Kwiatek|first6=W.

===Disadvantages===
A disadvantage of AFM compared with the [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) is the single scan image size. In one pass, the SEM can image an area on the order of square [[millimeter]]s with a [[depth of field]] on the order of millimeters, whereas the AFM can only image a maximum scanning area of about 150×150 micrometers and a maximum height on the order of 10-20 micrometers. One method of improving the scanned area size for AFM is by using parallel probes in a fashion similar to that of [[Millipede memory|millipede data storage]].

The scanning speed of an AFM is also a limitation. Traditionally, an AFM cannot scan images as fast as an SEM, requiring several minutes for a typical scan, while an SEM is capable of scanning at near real-time, although at relatively low quality. The relatively slow rate of scanning during AFM imaging often leads to thermal drift in the image&lt;ref name="feature2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V.

To eliminate image distortions induced by thermal drift, several methods have been introduced.&lt;ref name="feature2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="automatic2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scanning1994"/&gt;

AFM images can also be affected by nonlinearity, [[hysteresis]],&lt;ref name="analytical1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V.

Such filtering could "flatten" out real topographical features. However, newer AFMs utilize real-time correction software (for example, [[feature-oriented scanning]]&lt;ref name="fospm2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. V.

Some AFMs also use separated orthogonal scanners (as opposed to a single tube), which also serve to eliminate part of the cross-talk problems.
[[File:Afm artifact2.png|thumb|Showing an AFM artifact arising from a tip with a high radius of curvature with respect to the feature that is to be visualized.]]
As with any other imaging technique, there is the possibility of [[image artifacts]], which could be induced by an unsuitable tip, a poor operating environment, or even by the sample itself, as depicted on the right. These image artifacts are unavoidable; however, their occurrence and effect on results can be reduced through various methods.
Artifacts resulting from a too-coarse tip can be caused for example by inappropriate handling or de facto collisions with the sample by either scanning too fast or having an unreasonably rough surface, causing actual wearing of the tip.
[[File:Afm artifact.svg|thumb|AFM artifact, steep sample topography]]

Due to the nature of AFM probes, they cannot normally measure steep walls or overhangs.  Specially made cantilevers and AFMs can be used to modulate the probe sideways as well as up and down (as with dynamic contact and non-contact modes) to measure sidewalls, at the cost of more expensive cantilevers, lower lateral resolution and additional artifacts.

The latest efforts in integrating [[nanotechnology]] and biological research have been successful and show much promise for the future. Since nanoparticles are a potential vehicle of drug delivery, the biological responses of cells to these nanoparticles are continuously being explored to optimize their efficacy and how their design could be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jong|first1=Wim H De|last2=Borm|first2=Paul JA|title=Drug Delivery and Nanoparticles: Applications and Hazards|journal=Dovepress International Journal of Nanomedicine|date=June 2008|pages=133–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrgiotakis et al. were able to study the interaction between CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; engineered nanoparticles and cells by attaching the engineered nanoparticles to the AFM tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyrgiotakis|first1=Georgios|last2=Blattmann|first2=Christoph O.|last3=Demokritou|first3=Philip|title=Real-Time Nanoparticle-Cell Interactions in Physiological Media by Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering|date=10 June 2014|issue=Sustainable Nanotechnology 2013|pages=1681–1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have taken advantage of AFM to obtain further information on the behavior of live cells in biological media. Real-time atomic force spectroscopy (or nanoscopy) and dynamic atomic force spectroscopy have been used to study live cells and membrane proteins and their dynamic behavior at high resolution, on the nanoscale. Imaging and obtaining information on the topography and the properties of the cells has also given insight into chemical processes and mechanisms that occur through cell-cell interaction and interactions with other signaling molecules (ex. ligands). Evans and Calderwood used single cell force microscopy to study [[cell adhesion]] forces, bond kinetics/dynamic bond strength and its role in chemical processes such as cell signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Evan A.|last2=Calderwood|first2=David A.|title=Forces and Bond Dynamics in Cell Adhesion|journal=Science|date=25 May 2007|volume=316|issue=5828|pages=1148–1153|doi=10.1126/science.1137592|pmid=17525329|bibcode = 2007Sci...316.1148E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alsteen et al. have used AFM-based nanoscopy to perform a real-time analysis of the interaction between live [[mycobacteria]] and antimycobacterial drugs (specifically [[isoniazid]], [[ethionamide]], [[ethambutol]], and [[streptomycine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alsteens|first1=David|last2=Verbelen|first2=Claire|last3=Dague|first3=Etienne|last4=Raze|first4=Dominique|last5=Baulard|first5=Alain R.|last6=Dufrêne|first6=Yves F.|title=Organization of the Mycobacterial Cell Wall: A Nanoscale View|journal=Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology|date=April 2008|volume=456|issue=1|pages=117–125|doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0386-0|pmid=18043940}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as an example of the more in-depth analysis of pathogen-drug interactions that can be done through AFM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">The Australian Geoscience Data Cube ('''AGDC''') is an approach to storing, processing and analyzing large collections of earth observation data. The technology is designed to meet challenges of national interest by being agile and flexible with vast amounts of layered grid data.

The AGDC reduces processing time of traditional image analysis by calibrating, pre-computing known extents, pixel alignment and storing metadata in a cell lattice structure. The temporal-pixel aligned data can often be analysed faster across space and time dimensions than previous scene based techniques. This allows the AGDC to be flexible in tackling future challenges and improve analysis times on ''every-increasing'' data repositories of earth observation.

The AGDC has also been used internationally &lt;ref&gt;http://ceos.org/&lt;/ref&gt; to allow countries to maintain ecologically sustainable programs and reduce the difficultly curve of utilizing [[Remote Sensing]] data.&lt;ref&gt;https://software.nasa.gov/featuredsoftware/ceos2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The AGDC was originally conceived by [[Geoscience Australia]] but is now maintained in a partnership between [[Geoscience Australia]], [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) and [[National Computational Infrastructure National Facility (Australia)]] (NCI). This is made possible by the funding from the partnership and a number of organisations such as National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis Ready Data, Ingestion and Indexing ==

The data processed in the cube is made ''analysis ready'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.datacube.org.au/wiki/Category:Analysis_Ready_Data&lt;/ref&gt; before being ingested and indexed into the AGDC. Analysis ready data is pre-processed data that has applied corrections for instrument calibration (gains and offsets), geolocation (spatial alignment) and radiometry (solar illumination, incidence angle, topography, atmospheric interference). The ingestion process manages the translation of datasets into the storage units while maintaining a database index. The data within the storage and index can be accessed via API calls often compiled within code such as [[Python (programming language)]].

Example

''s2a_l1c = dc.load(product='s2a_level1c_granule',x=(147.36, 147.41), y=(-35.1, -35.15), measurements=['04','03','02'], output_crs='EPSG:4326', resolution=(-0.00025,0.00025))''

=== Datasets currently stored ===
*[[Geoscience Australia]] [[Landsat]] Surface Reflectance (1987 to present)
*[[Landsat]] Pixel Quality
*[[Landsat]] Fractional Cover
*[[Landsat]] NDVI

=== Datasets that have been piloted ===
*[[USGS]] Landsat Surface Reflectance
*[[SRTM]] DEM
*[[Himawari 8]]
*[[MODIS]]
*[[Sentinel-2]] L1C / S2A
*Australian Gridded Climate Data

== Open source ==

The AGDC code base is situated in [[GitHub]] as an open repository.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-core&lt;/ref&gt; The core code base moved to the ''Open Data Cube'' in early 2017 as part of an international collaboration. Whilst the code base is the ''Open Data Cube'', individual cubes exist as their own right such as the AGDC on the [[National Computational Infrastructure National Facility (Australia)]] (NCI) using the High-Performance Computing Cluster [[HPCC]]. The core code can be installed on personal computers or public computers (using git) and has many unit tests.

Documentation for the code base exists on Read the Docs.&lt;ref&gt;https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of the AGDC ==

The AGDC is designed to meet nationally significant challenges such as the following.

*[[Sustainability]]
*Environment
*[[Water resource management]]
*Disaster assist
*Policy development
*[[Community planning]]
*Forest preservation
*Carbon measurement

== International Awards ==

The AGDC won &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ga.gov.au/news-events/news/latest-news/australian-geoscience-data-cube-innovation-recognised-on-world-stage&lt;/ref&gt; the '''2016 Content Platform of the Year''' award from Geospatial World Forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://geospatialworldforum.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cauchy distribution''', named after [[Augustin Cauchy]], is a [[continuous probability distribution]].  It is also known, especially among [[physicist]]s, as the '''Lorentz distribution''' (after [[Hendrik Lorentz]]), '''Cauchy–Lorentz distribution''', '''Lorentz(ian) function''', or '''Breit–Wigner distribution'''.  The Cauchy distribution &lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is the distribution of the ''x''-intercept of a ray issuing from &lt;math&gt;(x_0,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; with a uniformly distributed angle.  It is also the distribution of the [[Ratio distribution|ratio of two]] independent [[Normal Distribution | normally distributed]] random variables if the denominator distribution has mean zero.

The Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a "[[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]" distribution since both its [[expected value]] and its [[variance]] are undefined. (But see the section ''[[#Explanation of undefined moments|Explanation of undefined moments]]'' below.) The Cauchy distribution does not have finite [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of order greater than or equal to one; only fractional absolute moments exist.&lt;ref name=jkb1&gt;{{cite book|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=N. Balakrishnan |title=Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1994|ref=harv}}, Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cauchy distribution has no [[moment generating function]].

In [[mathematics]], it is closely related to the [[Poisson kernel]], which is the [[fundamental solution]] for the [[Laplace equation]] in the [[upper half-plane]].  In [[spectroscopy]], it is the description of the shape of [[spectral line]]s which are subject to [[homogeneous broadening]] in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably [[Line broadening#Pressure broadening|collision broadening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Hecht |year=1987 |title=Optics |page=603 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the few distributions that is [[stable distribution|stable]] and has a probability density function that can be expressed analytically, the others being the [[normal distribution]] and the [[Lévy distribution]].

==History==
Functions with the form of the density function of the Cauchy distribution were studied by mathematicians in the 17th century, but in a different context and under the title of the [[witch of Agnesi]]. Despite its name, the first explicit analysis of the properties of the Cauchy distribution was published by the French mathematician [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] in 1824, with Cauchy only becoming associated with it during an academic controversy in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Cauchy and the Witch of Agnesi in ''Statistics on the Table'', S M Stigler Harvard 1999 Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the name of the distribution is a case of [[Stigler's law of eponymy|Stigler's Law of Eponymy]]. Poisson noted that if the mean of observations following such a distribution were taken, the mean error did not converge to any finite number. As such, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace's]] use of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] with such a distribution was inappropriate, as it assumed a finite mean and variance. Despite this, Poisson did not regard the issue as important, in contrast to [[Irénée-Jules Bienaymé|Bienaymé]], who was to engage Cauchy in a long dispute over the matter.

==Characterisation==

===Probability density function===
The Cauchy distribution has the [[probability density function]] (PDF)&lt;ref name=jkb1/&gt;&lt;ref name=feller&gt;{{cite book|last=Feller|first=William|title=An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Volume II|edition=2|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=New York|year=1971|pages=704|isbn=978-0-471-25709-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma \left[1 + \left(\frac{x - x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]} = { 1 \over \pi \gamma } \left[ { \gamma^2 \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[location parameter]], specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scale parameter]] which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), alternatively &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to half the [[interquartile range]] and is sometimes called the [[probable error]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited such a density function in 1827 with an [[infinitesimal]] scale parameter, defining what would now be called a [[Dirac delta function]].

The maximum value or amplitude of the Cauchy PDF is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, located at &lt;math&gt;x=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

It is sometimes convenient to express the PDF  in terms of the complex parameter &lt;math&gt;\psi= x_0 + i\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x;\psi)=\frac{1}{\pi}\,\textrm{Im}\left(\frac{1}{x-\psi}\right)=\frac{1}{\pi}\,\textrm{Re}\left(\frac{-i}{x-\psi}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The special case when &lt;math&gt;x_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''standard Cauchy distribution''' with the probability density function&lt;ref name=mathmethods&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Ken F.|last2=Hobson|first2=Michael P.|last3=Bence|first3=Stephen J.|title=Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering|edition=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2006|pages=1333|isbn=978-0-511-16842-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=primer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=N.|last2=Nevrozov|first2=V. B.|title=A Primer on Statistical Distributions|edition=1|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|year=2003|pages=305|isbn=0-471-42798-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; 0,1) = \frac{1}{\pi (1 + x^2)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

In physics, a three-parameter Lorentzian function is often used:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma,I) = \frac{I}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]} = I \left[ { \gamma^2 \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the peak. The three-parameter Lorentzian function indicated is not, in general, a probability density function, since it does not integrate to 1, except in the special case where  &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Cumulative distribution function===
The [[cumulative distribution function]] of the Cauchy distribution is:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x; x_0,\gamma)=\frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[quantile function]] (inverse [[cumulative distribution function|cdf]]) of the Cauchy distribution is
:&lt;math&gt;Q(p; x_0,\gamma) = x_0 + \gamma\,\tan\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the first and third quartiles are &lt;math&gt;(x_0 - \gamma, x_0 + \gamma)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence the [[interquartile range]] is &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

For the standard distribution, the cumulative distribution function simplifies to [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arctangent function]] &lt;math&gt;\arctan(x)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x; 0,1)=\frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(x\right)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Entropy ===

The entropy of the Cauchy distribution is given by:

The derivative of the [[quantile function]], the quantile density function, for the Cauchy distribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;Q'(p; \gamma) = \gamma\,\pi\,{\sec}^2\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac 1 2 \right)\right].\!&lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential entropy]] of a distribution can be defined in terms of its quantile density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasicek  |first1=Oldrich |year=1976 |title=A Test for Normality Based on Sample Entropy |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=54–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically:

:&lt;math&gt;H(\gamma) = \int_0^1 \log\,(Q'(p; \gamma))\,\mathrm dp = \log(4\pi\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

The Cauchy distribution is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] for a random variate &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; for which

==Properties==
The Cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution which has no [[mean]], [[variance]] or higher [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] defined. Its [[mode (statistics)|mode]] and [[median]] are well defined and are both equal to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are two independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]]s with [[expected value]] 0 and [[variance]] 1, then the ratio &lt;math&gt;U/V&lt;/math&gt; has the standard Cauchy distribution.

If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;p\times p&lt;/math&gt; positive-semidefinite covariance matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries, then for [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] &lt;math&gt;X,Y\sim N(0,\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; and any random &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w_1+\cdots+w_p=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_i\geq 0, i=1,\ldots,p,&lt;/math&gt; (defining a  [[categorical distribution]]) it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^p w_j\frac{X_j}{Y_j}\sim\mathrm{Cauchy}(0,1).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Pillai N. and Meng, X.L.|date=|year=2016|title=An unexpected encounter with Cauchy and Lévy|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01957.pdf|journal=[[The Annals of Statistics]]|volume=44|issue=5|pages=2089-2097|doi=|jstor=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;X_1, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables, each with a standard Cauchy distribution, then the [[Arithmetic mean|sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;(X_1 + \cdots + X_n)/n&lt;/math&gt; has the same standard Cauchy distribution. To see that this is true, compute the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the sample mean:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\overline{X}}(t) = \mathrm{E}\left[e^{i\overline{X}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean. This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the [[central limit theorem]] cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all [[stable distribution]]s, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.

The Cauchy distribution is an [[infinitely divisible probability distribution]]. It is also a strictly [[stability (probability)|stable]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Campbell B. Read, N. Balakrishnan, Brani Vidakovic and Samuel Kotz |year=2006 |title=[[Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences]] |page=778 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-15044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard Cauchy distribution coincides with the [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] with one degree of freedom.

Like all stable distributions, the [[location-scale family]] to which the Cauchy distribution belongs is closed under [[linear transformations]] with [[real number|real]] coefficients. In addition, the Cauchy distribution is closed under [[Möbius transformation|linear fractional transformations]] with real coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. B. Knight|title=A characterization of the Cauchy type|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume = 55|year = 1976|pages= 130–135|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/2041858|jstor=2041858}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, see also [[McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions]].

===Characteristic function===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote a Cauchy distributed random variable. The [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the Cauchy distribution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_X(t; x_0,\gamma) = \operatorname{E}\left[e^{iXt} \right ] =\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x;x_0,\gamma)e^{ixt}\,dx =  e^{ix_0t - \gamma |t|}.&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the [[Fourier transform]] of the probability density. The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi_X(t;x_0,\gamma)e^{-ixt} \, dt \!&lt;/math&gt;

The ''n''th moment of a distribution is the ''n''th derivative of the characteristic function evaluated at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that the characteristic function is not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have well-defined moments higher than the zeroth moment.

==Explanation of undefined moments==

===Mean===
If a [[probability distribution]] has a [[probability density function|density function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the mean, if it exists, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x)\,dx. \qquad\qquad (1)\!&lt;/math&gt;

We may evaluate this two-sided [[improper integral]] by computing the sum of two one-sided improper integrals. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty x f(x)\,dx+\int_{-\infty}^a x f(x)\,dx.\qquad\qquad (2) \!&lt;/math&gt;
for an arbitrary real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

For the integral to exist (even as an infinite value), at least one of the terms in this sum should be finite, or both should be infinite and have the same sign. But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the terms in this sum (2) are infinite and have opposite sign. Hence (1) is undefined, and thus so is the mean.&lt;ref name="uah"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/special/Cauchy.html | title=Cauchy Distribution | publisher=[[University of Alabama]] at Huntsville | work=Virtual Laboratories | accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the  [[Cauchy principal value]] of the Cauchy distribution is
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is zero. On the other hand, the related integral
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

is ''not'' zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral. This again shows that the mean (1) can not exist.

Various results in probability theory about [[expected value]]s, such as the [[strong law of large numbers]], fail to hold for the Cauchy distribution.&lt;ref name="uah"/&gt;

===Higher moments===
The Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of any order.  Some of the higher [[raw moment]]s do exist and have a value of infinity, for example the raw second moment:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[X^2] &amp; \propto \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty 1 - \frac{1}{1+x^2}\,dx \\[8pt]
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx-\pi = \infty.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By re-arranging the formula, one can see that the second moment is essentially the infinite integral of a constant (here 1).  Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity.  Odd-powered raw moments, however, are undefined, which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty&lt;/math&gt; since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs.  The first raw moment is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the [[central moment]]s and [[standardized moment]]s are undefined, since they are all based on the mean.  The variance—which is the second central moment—is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).

The results for higher moments follow from [[Hölder's inequality]], which implies that higher moments (or halves of moments) diverge if lower ones do.

==Estimation of parameters ==
Because the parameters of the Cauchy distribution do not correspond to a mean and variance, attempting to estimate the parameters of the Cauchy distribution by using a sample mean and a sample variance will not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/ee_distri_cauchy.html Illustration of instability of sample means]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an i.i.d. sample of size ''n'' is taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}=\frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

Although the sample values &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; will be concentrated about the central value &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more observations are taken, because of the increased probability of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the observations themselves; i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; than any single observation from the sample. Similarly, calculating the sample variance will result in values that grow larger as more observations are taken.

Therefore, more robust means of estimating the central value &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and the scaling parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are needed. One simple method is to take the median value of the sample as an estimator of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and half the sample [[interquartile range]] as an estimator of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Other, more precise and robust methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cane |first1=Gwenda J. |year=1974 |title=Linear Estimation of Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution Based on Sample Quantiles |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=69 |issue=345 |pages= 243–245 |jstor=2285535 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1974.10480163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jin |year=2010 |title=A Highly Efficient L-estimator for the Location Parameter of the Cauchy Distribution |journal=Computational Statistics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–105 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3p1430175v4806jq |doi=10.1007/s00180-009-0163-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[truncated mean]] of the middle 24% of the sample [[order statistics]] produces an estimate for &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean.&lt;ref name=rothenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothenberg |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Fisher|first2=Franklin, M.|last3=Tilanus|first3=C.B.|year=1964|volume=59|issue=306|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on estimation from a Cauchy sample|pages=460-463|doi=10.1080/01621459.1964.10482170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=Daniel|year=1966|volume=61 |issue=316 |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on the estimation of the location parameters of the Cauchy distribution|pages=852&amp;ndash;855|jstor=2282794|doi=10.1080/01621459.1966.10480912}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[fat tails]] of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases if more than 24% of the sample is used.&lt;ref name=rothenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;

[[Maximum likelihood]] can also be used to estimate the parameters &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. However, this tends to be complicated by the fact that this requires finding the roots of a high degree polynomial, and there can be multiple roots that represent local maxima.&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S. |year=1978 |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=73|issue=361|title=Maximum Likelihood Estimates of the Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution for Samples of Size 3 and 4|page=211|jstor=2286549 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1978.10480031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient, it is relatively inefficient for small samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitman estimator of the Cauchy location parameter|last1=Cohen Freue|first1=Gabriella V.|journal=Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference|volume=137|issue=6|year=2007|page=1901|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/69424/USEPAP/Coushy%20dist.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jspi.2006.05.002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816002255/http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/69424/USEPAP/Coushy%20dist.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Robust Estimation &amp; Hypothesis Testing |last1=Wilcox |first1=Rand |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The log-likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution for sample size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat\ell(\!x_0,\gamma\mid x_1,\dotsc,x_n) = - n \log (\gamma \pi) - \sum_{i=1}^n \log \left(1 + \left(\frac{x_i - x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Maximizing the log likelihood function with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; produces the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i - x_0}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - \!x_0]^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + [x_i - x_0]^2} &lt;/math&gt;

is a monotone function in &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and that the solution &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \min |x_i-x_0|\le \gamma\le \max |x_i-x_0|. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving just for &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; requires solving a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;2n-1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; and solving just for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; requires solving a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (first for &lt;math&gt;\gamma^2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both parameters simultaneously, a [[numerical analysis|numerical]] solution on a computer is typically required. The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; by maximum likelihood.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=V.

==Multivariate Cauchy distribution==
A [[random vector]] &lt;math&gt;X=(X_1, \ldots, X_k)'&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components &lt;math&gt;Y=a_1X_1+ \cdots + a_kX_k&lt;/math&gt; has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb R^k&lt;/math&gt;, the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y=a'X&lt;/math&gt; should have a univariate Cauchy distribution.&lt;ref name=ferg2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S.|title=A Representation of the Symmetric Bivariate Cauchy Distribution|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |volume= |issue= |year=1962 |page=1256 |jstor=2237984|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177704357|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177704357|accessdate=2017-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_X(t) =  e^{ix_0(t)-\gamma(t)}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt; are real functions with &lt;math&gt;x_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; a [[homogeneous function]] of degree one and &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt; a positive homogeneous function of degree one.&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;  More formally:&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_0(at) = ax_0(t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma (at) = |a|\gamma (t),&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:&lt;ref name=bivar&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-linear Integral Equations to Approximate Bivariate Densities with Given Marginals and Dependence Function|last1=Molenberghs|first1=Geert|last2=Lesaffre|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Statistica Sinica|volume=7|year=1997|pages=713&amp;ndash;738|url=http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A7n310.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914055538/http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A7n310.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y; x_0,y_0,\gamma)= { 1 \over 2 \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over ((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 +\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \right] .&lt;/math&gt;
Note that in this example, even though there is no analogue to a covariance matrix, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are not [[Independence (probability theory)|statistically independent]].&lt;ref name=bivar/&gt;

We also can write this formula for complexe variable. Then the probability density function of complexe cauchy is :

&lt;math&gt;f(z; z_0,\gamma)= { 1 \over 2 \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over (|z-z_0|^2 +\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \right] .&lt;/math&gt;

Analogous to the univariate density, the multidimensional Cauchy density also relates to the [[multivariate Student distribution]]. They are equivalent when the degrees of freedom parameter is equal to one. The density of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; dimension Student distribution with one degree of freedom becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;f({\mathbf x}; {\mathbf\mu},{\mathbf\Sigma}, k)= \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1+k}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})\pi^{\frac{k}{2}}\left|{\mathbf\Sigma}\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}\left[1+({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})^T{\mathbf\Sigma}^{-1}({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})\right]^{\frac{1+k}{2}}} .&lt;/math&gt;

Properties and details for this density can be obtained by taking it as a particular case of the multivariate Student density.

The Cauchy distribution is the [[stable distribution]] of index 1.

*In [[hydrology]] the Cauchy distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Cauchy distribution to ranked monthly maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% [[confidence belt]] based on the [[binomial distribution]]. The rainfall data are represented by [[plotting position]]s as part of the [[cumulative frequency analysis]].

The '''Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''DARPA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]] responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

Originally known as the '''Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''ARPA'''), the agency was created in February 1958 by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in response to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] launching of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate [[U.S. military]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Commission2008"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science &amp; Technology, (2008). Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101027163454/http://eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20%26%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20%28v2%29.pdf Source].&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as [[computer networking]] and the basis for the modern Internet, and [[graphical user interface]]s in information technology.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has about 220 employees, of whom approximately 100 are in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa|title=About DARPA|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972, momentarily changing back to ARPA in February 1993, only to revert to DARPA in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/arpa-darpa-and-jason/|title=ARPA, DARPA, and Jason - Military Embedded Systems|website=mil-embedded.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, DARPA's mission statement is "to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |title=DARPA Mission |last= |first= |date= |website=www.darpa.mil |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430171501/http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/mission |archivedate=2017-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==History==
[[File:DARPA through 50 years.ogv|thumb|right|DARPA achievements for the past 50 years]]

===Early history (1959–1969)===
The creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was authorized by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements,&lt;ref name="Commission2008"/&gt; the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_year_1958_supplemental_military_c.html?id=N-IPAAAAIAAJ |title = Fiscal Year 1958 Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force): Hearings, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9739 |date=1958|author1 = Subcommittee On Military Construction |first1 = United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Armed Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of [[Sputnik]] and to U.S. realization that the [[Soviet Union]] had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards20 &gt;"$ 520 million appropriation and a $ 2 billion budget plan." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 20). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA.&lt;ref name = Wizards21 &gt;"Roy Johnson, ARPA’s first director, was, like his boss, a businessman. At age fifty-two, he had been personally recruited by McElroy, who convinced him to leave a $160,000 job with General Electric and take an $18,000 job in Washington." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert York]] from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was hired as his scientific assistant.&lt;ref name = Wizards21a &gt;"Herbert York, whom Killian had been keen on, was given the job and moved to ARPA from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when [[NASA]] was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do "high-risk", "high-gain", "far out" basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities.&lt;ref name = Wizards21,22 &gt;"The staff of ARPA saw an opportunity to redefine the agency as a group that would take on the really advanced "far-out" research....The scientific community, predictably, rallied to the call for a reinvention of ARPA as a "high-risk high-gain" research sponsor— the kind of R&amp; D shop they had dreamed of all along" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 21,22). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961. He was succeeded by [[Jack Ruina]] who served until 1963.&lt;ref name = Wizards23,24 &gt;"In early 1961 ARPA’s second director, Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, resigned" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 23,24) Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards23 &gt;"Ruina raised ARPA’s annual budget to $ 250 million." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruina who hired [[J. C. R. Licklider]] as the first administrator of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]], which played a vital role in creation of [[ARPANET]], the basis for the future Internet.&lt;ref name = Wizards27-39  &gt;"J. C. R. Licklider." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 27–39). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&amp;D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.&lt;ref name = Wizards23a &gt;projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities." Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&amp;D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&amp;D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629003311/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-29 |title=The Story of GPS |author=Catherine Alexandrow |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gap&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/first_50_years.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506103713/http://www.darpa.mil/About/History/First_50_Years.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-06 |title=DARPA: 50 Years of Bridging the Gap |date=Apr 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |author1=Stefanie Chiou |author2=Craig Music |author3=Kara Sprague |author4=Rebekah Wahba |date=5 Dec 2001 |title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101306/http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael |title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516195054/http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History%3ABertram_Raphael |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].

===Later history (1970–1980)===
The [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.

The resulting "[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===Recent history (1981–present)===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or [[Hypersonic Research Program (DARPA)|Hypersonic Research Program]]. The [[Strategic Computing Program (DARPA)|Strategic Computing Program]] enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

On October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', "Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground", October 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.&lt;ref name="Building X Planes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |title=NASA and DARPA plan to release new X-Planes |last=Grady |first=Mary |date=June 5, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=June 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120846/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |title=Darpa to create Cyber Grand Challenge to fight security vulnerabilities |last=Howley |first=Daniel |date=17 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190614/https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |archivedate=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern [[anti-tank weapon]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/darpa-gxv-t-demonstration-military-vehicle-technology/55198/ "DARPA demonstrates 6 new technologies behind the agile combat vehicles of tomorrow"] New Atlas, June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Adaptive Execution Office (DARPA)|Adaptive Execution Office (AEO)]] is one of two new DARPA offices created in 2009 by the DARPA Director, [[Regina Dugan]]. The office's four project areas include technology transition, assessment, rapid [[productivity]] and [[adaptive system]]s. AEO provides the agency with robust connections to the warfighter community and assists the agency with the planning and execution of technology demonstrations and field trials to promote adoption by the warfighter, accelerating the transition of new technologies into DoD capabilities. 
* The [[Defense Sciences Office|Defense Sciences Office (DSO)]] vigorously pursues the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and develops those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |title=DARPA/DSO Home Page |date=2 December 1998 |website=archive.org |accessdate=6 June 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202153000/http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |archivedate=2 December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSO identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff fundamental research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines – sometimes reshaping existing fields or creating entirely new disciplines – and transforms these initiatives into radically new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security.&amp;nbsp;
* The [[Information Innovation Office|Information Innovation Office (I2O)]] aims to ensure U.S. technological superiority in all areas where information can provide a decisive military advantage. Some of the program managers in I2O are Wade Shen (as of December 2014), Stuart Wagner (as of September 2014), Steve Jameson (as of August 2014), Angelos Keromytis (as of July 2014), and David Doermann (as of April 2014). Brian Pierce is currently the office director.
* The [[Microsystems Technology Office|Microsystems Technology Office (MTO)]] mission focuses on the heterogeneous microchip-scale integration of electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Their high risk/high payoff technology is aimed at solving the national level problems of protection from biological, chemical and information attack and to provide operational dominance for mobile distributed command and control, combined manned/unmanned warfare, and dynamic, adaptive military planning and execution.
* The [[Strategic Technology Office (DARPA)|Strategic Technology Office (STO)]] mission is to focus on technologies that have a global theater-wide impact and that involve multiple Services.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051855/http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }} DARPA Offices. Retrieved 2009-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tactical Technology Office (DARPA)|Tactical Technology Office (TTO)]] engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the "system" and "subsystem" approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems. 
* The [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|Biological Technologies Office (BTO)]] fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security. Created in April 2014 by then director [[Arati Prabhakar]], taking programs from the MTO and DSO divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2014-04-01|title=DARPA Launches Biological Technologies Office |date=1 April 2014 |website=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former offices===
* [[Information Awareness Office]]: 2002–2003
* The [[Advanced Technology Office (DARPA)|Advanced Technology Office (ATO)]] researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Special Projects Office (DARPA)|Special Projects Office (SPO)]] researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The [[Information Systems Office| Information Systems Office (ISO)]] in the 1990s developed system applications of advanced information technologies.  It was a predecessor to the Information Exploitation Office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708012812/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-08 | work=Defense Daily | title=DARPA restructures/creates new offices | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Electronic Systems Technology Office]] combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office. This new office will focus on the boundary between general-purpose computers and the physical world, such as sensors, displays and the first few layers of specialized signal-processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces.
* The [[Computing Systems Technology Office]] combined functions of the old Information Sciences and Tactical Technology office. The office "will work scalable parallel and distributed heterogeneous computing systems technologies", DoD said.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office]] and the [[Computing Systems office]] will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High-Performance Computing Initiative. The Software office will also be responsible for "software systems technology, [[machine intelligence]] and software engineering".
* The [[Land Systems Office]] was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti-armor systems, once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office
* The [[Undersea Warfare Office]] combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counterstealth and automation.
Reorganization in 2010 merged two offices:
* The [[Transformational Convergence Technology Office (DARPA)|Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO)]] mission was to advance new crosscutting capabilities derived from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends, particularly in areas related to computing and computing-reliant subareas of the life sciences, social sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The TCTO was folded into the I2O in 2010.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |title=Embedded Clouds: A Look Back at HPEC 2010 |work=HPCwire |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707185535/http://www.hpcwire.com/2010/09/22/embedded_clouds_a_look_back_at_hpec_2010/ |archivedate=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Information Processing Techniques Office|Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO)]] focused on inventing the networking, computing, and software technologies vital to ensuring DOD military superiority. The IPTO was combined with TCTO in 2010 to form the I2O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |title=Schedule – sxsw.com |work=SXSW Schedule 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909201234/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP28839 |archivedate=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

* DARPA is well known as a high-tech government agency, and as such has many appearances in popular fiction.  Some realistic references to DARPA in fiction are as "ARPA" in ''[[Tom Swift]] and the Visitor from Planet X'' (DARPA consults on a technical threat),&lt;ref&gt;Victor Appleton II, 1961.

ARPA is referred to on [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17985/17985-h/17985-h.htm#chap_8 page 68]  published 1961&lt;/ref&gt; in episodes of television program ''[[The West Wing]]'' (the ARPA-DARPA distinction), the television program ''[[Numb3rs]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Numb3ers'', [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis_los_angeles/recaps/105/recaps.php?season=1 Season 1, Episode 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325095828/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis_los_angeles/recaps/105/recaps.php?season=1 |date=2010-03-25 }}, and [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~numb3rs/spulido/Numb3rs_season5/Numb3rs_517.html Season 5, Episode 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513021858/http://www.math.cornell.edu/~numb3rs/spulido/Numb3rs_season5/Numb3rs_517.html |date=2010-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (DARPA research into creating the first self-aware computer), and in the motion picture ''[[Executive Decision]]'' (use of a one-of-a-kind experimental prototype in an emergency).
* DARPA is depicted in the visual novel/anime series ''[[Steins;Gate 0 (TV series)|Steins;Gate 0]]'' as DURPA, a shadowy government organization that has been researching time travel in order to gain an advantage against Russia, which is also developing time travel in the upcoming World War III.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="906">The '''dollar glut''' is a term for the accumulation of [[American dollars]] outside of the United States as a [[Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar|reserve currency]], contrasted with the dollar gap, which led to the creation of the [[Marshall Plan]] following [[World War II]]. The eventual shift to a dollar glut forced the end of the [[gold standard]] in the United States and led to the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]].

The stability of the [[Bretton Woods system]] came to depend upon the ability of the US government to exchange dollars for gold at $35 an ounce. The American ability to fulfill this commitment began to diminish as the postwar dollar shortage was transformed into an overabundance of dollars, also known as the dollar glut.&lt;ref&gt;Oatley, International Political Economy 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florencite-(Sm)''' is a very rare mineral of the [[plumbogummite]] group ([[alunite]] supergroup) with simplified formula SmAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mindat /&gt; [[Samarium]] in florencite-(Sm) is substituted by other [[rare earth elements]], mostly [[neodymium]]. It does not form separate crystals, but is found as zones in florencite-(Ce),&lt;ref name=GOD /&gt; which is [[cerium]]-dominant member of the plumbogummite group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindat.org/min-1560.htm |title=Florencite-(Ce): Florencite-(Ce) mineral information and data |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=2016-03-09}}l&lt;/ref&gt; Florencite-(Sm) is also a samarium-analogue of florencite-(La) ([[lanthanum]]-dominant) and waylandite ([[bismuth]]-dominant), both being aluminium-rich minerals.&lt;ref name=Mindat /&gt;

==Occurrence and association==
Florencite-(Sm) was revealed in quartz veins in the [[Maldynyrd]] Range, [[Subpolar Urals]], Russia. It associates with [[xenotime-(Y)]].&lt;ref name=GOD /&gt;

==Notes on chemistry==
Florencite-(Sm) has admixtures of [[neodymium]], and small amounts of [[cerium]], [[gadolinium]], [[sulfur]], [[strontium]], [[praseodymium]], [[calcium]], [[lanthanum]], [[europium]], and [[silicon]].&lt;ref name=GOD /&gt;

'''''How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming''''' is the 2010 memoir by [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the American [[astronomer]] most responsible for the [[2006 definition of planet|reclassification]] of the [[list of former planets|former]] planet [[Pluto]] from [[Definition of planet|planet]] to [[dwarf planet]].&lt;ref name="Lengel2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown-0-385-53108-7"/&gt;

== Summary ==
The memoir is an account of the events surrounding the [[IAU definition of planet|redefinition of the term ''planet'']] that eventually changed the status of Pluto. It chronicles the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a dwarf planet then mistakenly thought to be larger than Pluto, located within the [[scattered disc]], beyond Neptune's orbit. The replaying of events includes the adversarial challenging of long-held scientific beliefs between some of the world's leading astronomers, and the eventual 2006 [[International Astronomical Union]]'s vote that removed Pluto from the list of [[Solar System]] planets.&lt;ref name="Lengel2011"/&gt;

== Reviews ==
Reviews of the book have been generally positive, with James Kennedy of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' calling the book a "brisk" and "enjoyable ... chronicle" of the tale of the search for new planets and the eventual demotion of Pluto from planetary status.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010"/&gt; Janet Maslin of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called it a "short, eager-to-please research memoir".&lt;ref name="Maslin2010"/&gt;

Human protein reference database—2006 update. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan;34(Database issue):D411-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peri et al. Development of human protein reference database as an initial platform for approaching systems biology in humans. Genome Res. 2003 Oct;13:2363-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, researchers can add new data to HPRD by registering to Human Proteinpedia. The data deposited in Human Proteinpedia is freely available for download. Emphasizing the importance of [[proteomics]] data disposition to public repositories, ''Nature Methods'' recommends Human Proteinpedia in their editorial.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial. Thou shalt share your data. Nat Methods. 2008 Mar;5:209&lt;/ref&gt; More than 70 labs participate in this effort.

==Data types==

Data pertaining to [[post-translational modifications]], [[protein–protein interactions]], tissue expression, expression in [[cell lines]], [[subcellular localization]] and [[enzyme]] substrate relationships can be submitted to Human Proteinpedia.

==Experimental platforms==

# [[Co-immunoprecipitation]] and [[mass spectrometry]]-based protein–protein interaction
# [[Co-immunoprecipitation]] and Western blotting based protein–protein interaction
# [[Fluorescence]] based experiments
# [[Immunohistochemistry]]
# Mass spectrometric analysis
# [[Protein]] and [[peptide microarray]]s
# [[Western blot]]ting
# [[Yeast two-hybrid]] based protein–protein interaction

This portal that allows adding of protein information was developed as a collaborative effort between the laboratory of Dr. Akhilesh Pandey at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [http://www.ibioinformatics.org Institute of Bioinformatics]

'''Iron stress repressed RNA''' (IsrR) is a cis-encoded [[antisense]] RNA which regulates the expression of the photosynthetic protein isiA. IsiA expression is activated by the [[Ferric uptake regulator family|Ferric uptake regulator protein]] (Fur) under [[iron]] stress conditions. IsiA enhances photosynthesis by forming a ring around [[photosystem I]] which acts as an additional antenna complex.&lt;ref name="pmid16636284"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dühring U, Axmann IM, Hess WR, Wilde A |title=An internal antisense RNA regulates expression of the photosynthesis gene isiA |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16636284 |pmc=1459017 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600927103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsrR is abundant when there is a sufficient iron concentration. IsrR is encoded for within the opposite stand of isiA gene and contains a conserved [[stem loop]] secondary structure. Under sufficient iron conditions IsrR binds to its complementary region which corresponds to the central third of the isiA [[mRNA]]. The resulting duplex RNA is then targeted for degradation. This allows the antisense RNA to act as a reversible switch that responds to changes in environmental conditions to modulate the expression of the isiA protein.

IsrR was originally identified within cyanobacteria but may be conserved throughout a number of photosynthetic species from multiple kingdoms. At present, IsrR is the only non coding RNA identified that has a regulatory role on photosynthetic proteins.

'''Julius Victor Carus''' (July 25, 1823 – March 10, 1903) was a [[Germany|German]] [[zoologist]], [[Comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] and [[entomologist]].

==Career==

Carus was born in [[Leipzig]]. He served as curator of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy at [[Oxford University]] from 1849 to 1851, and as professor of comparative anatomy and director of the Zoological Museum at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/namedef-849 Darwin Correspondence Project: Julius Viktor Carus, 1823–1903]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carus was an early supporter of [[Darwinism]]. With [[Charles Darwin]]'s approval he became his German translator. In 1875, Carus issued a German edition of Darwin's collected works.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Alfred. ''The Descent of Darwin: The Popularization of Darwinism in Germany, 1860-1914''. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Escherich was born in [[Schwandorf|Schwandorf, Bavaria]], to parents Hermann N. Escherich and Katharina von Stengel. His older brother [[Georg Escherich]] would become a noted forester and politician.

He studied medicine in Munich and Würzburg, graduating in 1893. After gaining his postdoctoral qualification in Strasbourg in 1901, he received a professorship at the Department of Forest Zoology in Tharandt in 1907, which had been orphaned since the death of [[Hinrich Nitsche]]. In 1914 he joined the Chair of Applied Zoology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, where he succeeded [[August Pauly]]. In 1917 he was elected a member of the [[Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].

After a 1911 trip to the United States, he conceived a plan to redesign [[applied entomology]] in Germany after the American model. In 1913 he co-founded the German Society for Applied Entomology.

Karl Escherich was one of the few forestry academics who took part in the early Hitler movement of the inflation period. He joined the Nazi Party in 1921, and participated in the 1923 [[Munich Putsch]]. In 1924, he still participated in the election campaign for the "Volkischer Block", but remained remote from the new NSDAP.

For his research, Karl Escherich received the Goethe Medal for Art and Science.

To commemorate its founder, the German Society for Applied Entomology awards the Escherich Medal for outstanding achievements in the field of entomology.

== Importance of land change modeling ==
[[File:Spycharka DT 75.JPG|thumb|Bulldozers are often used to clear land for development or agriculture.]]
Changes in [[land systems]] have consequences for climate and environmental change on every scale. Therefore, decisions and policies in relation to land systems are very important for reacting these changes and working towards a more sustainable society and planet.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land change models are significant in their ability to help guide the land systems to positive societal and environmental outcomes at a time when attention to changes across land systems is increasing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Briassoulis|first=Helen|date=2000-01-01|title=Analysis of Land Use Change: Theoretical and Modeling Approaches|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/rriwholbk/17.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plethora of science and practitioner communities have been able to advance the amount and quality of data in land change modeling in the past few decades. That has influenced the development of methods and technologies in model land change. The multitudes of land change models that have been developed are significant in their ability to address land system change and useful in various science and practitioner communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the science community, land change models are important in their ability to test theories and concepts of land change and its connections to human-environment relationships, as well as explore how these dynamics will change future land systems without real-world observation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Land change modeling is useful to explore spatial land systems, uses, and covers. Land change modeling can account for complexity within dynamics of land use and land cover by linking with climactic, ecological, biogeochemical, biogeophysical and socioeconomic models. Additionally, LCMs are able to produce spatially explicit outcomes according to the type and complexity within the land system dynamics within the spatial extent. Many biophysical and socioeconomic variables influence and produce a variety of outcomes in land change modeling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Model uncertainty ==
[[File:Uriage Land Cover Change.png|thumb|300x300px|Land change is visible in this image from Japan. Models cannot be as certain as satellite imagery.]]
A notable property of all land change models is that they have some irreducible level of uncertainty in the model structure, parameter values, and/or input data. For instance, one uncertainty within land change models is a result from [[wikt:temporal|temporal]] non-stationarity that exists in land change processes, so the further into the future the model is applied, the more uncertain it is.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=XiaoHang|last2=Andersson|first2=Claes|date=2004-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of temporal dynamics on land-use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971502000455|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|series=Geosimulation|volume=28|issue=1–2|pages=107–124|doi=10.1016/S0198-9715(02)00045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another uncertainty within land change models are data and [[parameter]] uncertainties within physical principles (i.e., surface typology), which leads to uncertainties in being able to understand and predict physical processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Furthermore, land change model design are a product of both decision-making and physical processes. Human-induced impact on the socio-economic and ecological environment is important to take into account, as it is constantly changing land cover and sometimes model uncertainty. To avoid model uncertainty and interpret model outputs more accurately, a model diagnosis is used to understand more about the connections between land change models and the actual land system of the spatial extent. The overall importance of model diagnosis with model uncertainty issues is its ability to assess how interacting processes and the landscape are represented, as well as the uncertainty within the landscape and its processes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Approaches to land change modeling ==

=== Machine learning &amp; statistical models ===
A [[Machine learning|machine-learning approach]] uses land-cover data from the past to try to assess how land will change in the future, and works best with large datasets. There are multiple types of machine-learning and statistical models - a study in western Mexico from 2011 found that results from two outwardly similar models were considerably different, as one used a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] and the other used a simple weights-of-evidence model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez-Vega|first=Azucena|last2=Mas|first2=Jean-François|last3=Ligmann-Zielinska|first3=Arika|date=2012-03-01|title=Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481521100209X|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|volume=29|issue=1|pages=11–23|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular models ===
A [[Cellular automaton|cellular]] land change model uses maps of suitability for various types of land use, and compares areas that are immediately adjacent to one another to project changes into the future. Variations in the scale of cells in a cellular model can have significant impacts on model outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Ying|last2=Roth|first2=Andreas|last3=Yu|first3=Zhenrong|last4=Doluschitz|first4=Reiner|date=2010-08-01|title=The impact of variation in scale on the behavior of a cellular automata used for land use change modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000244|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|volume=34|issue=5|pages=400–408|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2010.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sector-based &amp; spatially disaggregated economic models ===
Economic models are built on principles of [[supply and demand]]. They use mathematical parameters in order to predict what land types will be desired and which will be discarded. These are frequently built for urban areas, such as a 2003 study of the highly dense [[Pearl River Delta]] in southern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seto|first=Karen C.|last2=Kaufmann|first2=Robert K.|date=2003-02-01|title=Modeling the Drivers of Urban Land Use Change in the Pearl River Delta, China: Integrating Remote Sensing with Socioeconomic Data|url=http://le.uwpress.org/content/79/1/106|journal=Land Economics|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=106–121|doi=10.2307/3147108|issn=0023-7639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agent-based models ===
Agent-based models try to simulate the behavior of many individuals making independent choices, and then see how those choices affect the landscape as a whole. Agent-based modeling can be complex - for instance, a 2005 study combined an agent-based model with computer-based [[genetic programming]] to explore land change in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatan peninsula]] of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manson|first=Steven M.|date=2005-12-01|title=Agent-based modeling and genetic programming for modeling land change in the Southern Yucatán Peninsular Region of Mexico|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880905002422|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=111|issue=1–4|pages=47–62|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2005.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid approaches ===
Many models do not limit themselves to one of the approaches above - they may combine several in order to develop a fully comprehensive and accurate model.

== Implementation opportunities for land change modeling ==

Scientists use LCMs to build and test theories in land change modeling for a variety of human and environmental dynamics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=500 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20001|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land change modeling has a variety of implementation opportunities in many science and practice disciplines, such as in decision-making, policy, and in real-world application in public and private domains. The science disciplines use LCMs to formalize and test land change theory, and the explore and experiment with different scenarios of land change modeling. The practical disciplines use LCMs to analyze current land change trends and explore future outcomes from policies or actions in order to set appropriate guidelines, limits and principles for policy and action. Research and practitioner communities may study land change to address topics related to land-climate interactions, water quantity and quality, food and fiber production, and urbanization, infrastructure, and the built environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Improvement and advancement of land change modeling ==

=== Improved land observational strategies ===
[[File:Markham-suburbs aerial-edit2.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography can be used in conjunction with satellite imagery and ground data to improve land change models.]]
One improvement for land change modeling can be made through better data and integration with available data and models. Improved observational data can influence modeling quality. Finer spatial and temporal resolution data that can integrate with [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and biogeophysical data can help land change modeling couple the socioeconomic and biogeological modeling types. Land change modelers should value data at finer scales. Fine data can give a better conceptual understanding of underlying constructs of the model and capture additional dimensions of land use. It is important to maintain the temporal and spatial continuity of data from airborne-based and survey-based observation through constellations of smaller satellite coverage, image processing algorithms, and other new data to link [[Satellite imagery|satellite-based]] land use information and land management information. It is also important to have better information on land change actors and their beliefs, preferences, and behaviors to improve the predictive ability of models and evaluate the consequences of alternative policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel|date=October 2013|title=Opportunities to improve impact, integration, and evaluation of land change models|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.07.012|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=5|pages=452–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aligning model choices with model goals ===
One important improvement for land change modeling can be made though better aligning model choices with model goals. It is important to choose the appropriate modeling approach based on the scientific and application contexts of the specific study of interest. For example, when someone needs to design a model with policy and policy actors in mind, they may choose an agent-based model. Here, structural economic or agent-based approaches are useful, but specific patterns and trends in land change as with many ecological systems may not be as useful. When one needs to grasp the early stages of problem identification, and thus needs to understand the scientific patterns and trend of land change, machine learning and cellular approaches are useful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating positive and normative approaches ===
Land Change Modeling should also better integrate positive and normative approaches to explanation and prediction based on evidence-based accounts of land systems. It should also integrate optimization approaches to explore the outcomes that are the most beneficial and the processes that might produce those outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Integrating across scales ===
It is important to better integrate data across scales. A models design is based on the dominant processes and data from a specific scale of application and spatial extent. Cross-scale dynamics and feedbacks between temporal and spatial scales influences the patterns and processes of the model. Process like tele-coupling, indirect land use change, and adaption to climate change at multiple scales requires better representation by cross-scale dynamics. Implementing these processes will require a better understanding of feedback mechanisms across scales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Opportunities in research infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure support ===
As there is continuous reinvention of modeling environments, frameworks, and platforms, land change modeling can improve from better research infrastructure support. For example, model and [[Software development process|software infrastructure development]] can help avoid duplication of initiatives by land change modeling community members, co-learn about land change modeling, and integrate models to evaluate impacts of land change. Better data infrastructure can provide more data resources to support compilation, curation, and comparison of heterogeneous data sources. Better community modeling and governance can advance decision-making and modeling capabilities within a community with specific and achievable goals. Community modeling and [[Community government|governance]] would provide a step towards reaching community agreement on specific goals to move modeling and data capabilities forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of modern challenges in land change modeling can potentially be addressed through contemporary advances in cyberinfrastructure such as crowd-source, “mining” for distributed data, and improving [[High Performance Computing|high-performance computing]]. Because it is important for modelers to find more data to better construct, calibrate, and validate structural models, the ability to analyze large amount of data on individual behaviors is helpful. For example, modelers can find point-of-sales data on individual purchases by consumers and internet activities that reveal social networks. However, some issues of privacy and propriety for crowdsourcing improvements have not yet been resolved.

The land change modeling community can also benefit from Global Positioning System and Internet-enabled mobile device data distribution. Combining various structural-based data-collecting methods can improve the availability of microdata and the diversity of people that see the findings and outcomes of land change modeling projects. For example, [[Crowdsourcing|citizen-contributed data]] supported the implementation of [[Ushahidi]] in [[Haiti]] after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], helping at least 4,000 disaster events. Universities, non-profit agencies, and volunteers are needed to collect information on events like this to make positive outcomes and improvements in land change modeling and land change modeling applications. Tools such as mobile devices are available to make it easier for participants to participate in collecting micro-data on agents. [[Google Maps]] uses cloud-based mapping technologies with datasets that are co-produced by the public and scientists. Examples in agriculture such as coffee farmers in Avaaj Otalo showed use of mobile phones for collecting information and as an interactive voice.

Cyberinfrastructure developments may also increase the ability of land change modeling to meet computational demands of various modeling approaches given increasing data volumes and certain expected model interactions. For example, improving the development of processors, data storage, network bandwidth, and coupling land change and environmental process models at high resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Land Change Modeling: Opportunities and Research Requirements|last=Brown et al.|first=Daniel G.|publisher=The National Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-28833-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=90–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model evaluation ===
An additional way to improve land change modeling is through improvement of [[Evaluation|model evaluation]] approaches. Improvement in [[sensitivity analysis]] is needed to gain a better understand of the variation in model output in response to model elements like input data, model parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and model structure. Improvement in [[Pattern recognition|pattern validation]] can help land change modelers make comparisons between model outputs parameterized for some historic case, like maps, and observations for that case. Improvement in uncertainty sources is needed to improve forecasting of future states that are non-stationary in processes, input variables, and boundary conditions. One can explicitly recognize stationarity assumptions and explore data for evidence in non-stationarity to better acknowledge and understand model uncertainty to improve uncertainty sources. Improvement in structural validation can help improve acknowledgement and understanding of the processes in the model and the processes operating in the real world through a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

They are short pins, with a head. Entomologists use them for holding down setting paper, and for pinning name labels inside collection cases. Botanists use them for mounting specimen envelopes containing [[bryophyte]] specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chemberlain|first=Edward B.|title=Mounting Moss Specimens|journal=The Bryologist|year=1903|volume=6|issue=5|pages=75–76|jstor=3238781|doi=10.1639/0007-2745(1903)6[75:mms]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list compiles known [[earthquakes]] that have caused one or more [[Death|fatalities]] since 1900. The list incorporates high quality earthquake source (i.e., origin time, [[Earthquake location|location]] and [[earthquake magnitude]]) and [[Death|fatality]] information from several sources.

[[Earthquake location]]s are taken from the Centennial Catalog&lt;ref name=" Engdahl and Villaseñor (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Handbook of Earthquake &amp; Engineering Seismology |series=Part A, Volume 81A |chapter=Global seismicity: 1900–1999 |first=E. R. |last=Engdahl |first2=A. |last2=Vallaseñor |year=2002 |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/centennial/centennial.pdf |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |edition=First |isbn=978-0124406520 |pages=665–690 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806192457/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/data/centennial.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the updated Engdahl, van der Hilst and Buland earthquake catalog,&lt;ref name="Engdahl et al, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Engdahl| first = E. R.|author2=R. van der Hilst |author3=R. Buland| title = Global teleseismic earthquake relocation with improved travel times and procedures for depth determination| journal = Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am. | volume = 88| issue = | pages = 722–743| year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is complete to December 2005. From January 2006, earthquake locations are from the [[United States Geological Survey]]’s Preliminary Determination of Epicenters (PDE)&lt;ref name="USGS, 2000"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sipkin | first = S. A. |author2=W. J. Person |author3=B. W. Presgrave | title = Earthquake bulletins and catalogs at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | year = 2000| url = https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/neic/neic_bulletins.php|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; monthly listing. Preferred magnitudes are [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]]s taken from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor Database and its predecessor, the [[Harvard]] Centroid Moment Tensor Database. Where these magnitude estimates are unavailable, the preferred magnitude estimate is taken from the Centennial Catalog and the PDE.

Five columns of fatality estimates are provided. The first two columns are derived from the PDE monthly catalog and indicate deaths resulting from earthquake shaking only (i.e., from partial or total building collapse), and total fatalities resulting from earthquake shaking and [[Earthquake#Effects.2Fimpacts of earthquakes|secondary effects]], such as [[tsunami]], [[landslide]], [[fire]], [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] or other factors (e.g., [[heart failure]]). Where these [[Earthquake#Effects.2Fimpacts of earthquakes|secondary effects]] are reported, they are indicated by “T”, “L”, “F” or “Lq”, respectively. Fatality estimates in the PDE are generally obtained from official sources (e.g., local or national government officials, humanitarian agencies, [[emergency management]] agencies, etc.) or media reports within days to weeks after the earthquake. The PDE catalog is not updated if more detailed information becomes available after its final publication, usually four months after the earthquake.

The third fatality column is taken from the Utsu catalog of deadly earthquakes,&lt;ref name="Utsu, 2002"&gt;{{citation|title=International Handbook of Earthquake &amp; Engineering Seismology|series=Part A, Volume 81A|chapter=A List of Deadly Earthquakes in the World: 1500–2000|first=T. R.|last=Utsu|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|edition=First|isbn=978-0124406520|pages=691–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally represents the total deaths resulting from an earthquake. The Utsu catalog is complete up until late 2003. The fourth column is derived from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). EM-DAT has been developed and maintained by the [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] at the Brussels campus of the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]], Belgium and is a global, multi-hazard (e.g., [[earthquake]], [[cyclone]], [[drought]], [[flood]], [[volcano]], [[extreme temperatures]], etc.) database of human impacts and economic losses.&lt;ref name="Peduzzi et al, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Peduzzi| first = P.|author2=H. Dao |author3=C. Herold | title = Mapping disastrous natural hazards using global datasets| journal = Natural Hazards| volume = 35| issue = 2| pages = 265–289| year = 2005| doi = 10.1007/s11069-004-5703-8| url = https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:24352/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthquake source parameters in the EM-DAT are often absent, incomplete, or erroneous. Consequently, several events may be missed in the automated catalog associations. Furthermore, where the impact of an earthquake spans political boundaries, database entries are often subdivided by country. For significant events, the observed fatalities are aggregated and manually associated.

The final fatality column is for other sources of shaking deaths and indicates improved fatality estimates from official reports and detailed scholarly studies, where available.

The death tolls presented below vary widely in quality and in many cases are estimates only, particularly for the most catastrophic events that result in high fatalities. Note that in some cases, fatalities have been documented, but no numerical value of deaths is given. In these cases, fatality estimates are left blank. Many of the events listed with no numerical value are [[aftershock]]s where additional fatalities are aggregated with the [[main shock]].

'''Little Joe 5''' was an unmanned atmospheric test flight of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the U.S. [[Project Mercury|Mercury program]]. The objective was to test a production Mercury capsule (#3) and the [[Launch escape system|Launch Escape System]] during an ascent abort at maximum dynamic pressure. The mission was launched November 8, 1960, from Wallops Island, Virginia. Sixteen seconds after liftoff, the escape rocket and the tower jettison rocket both fired prematurely. Furthermore, the booster, capsule and escape tower failed to separate as intended. The entire stack was destroyed on impact with the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch9-6.htm NASA SP-4201]&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Joe 5 flew to an apogee of 10.1 miles (16.2&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 13 miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km). Some capsule and booster debris was recovered from the ocean floor for post flight analysis.

'''Lotka's law''',&lt;ref name=seminalarticle&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lotka, Alfred J.|year=1926|title=The frequency distribution of scientific productivity|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|volume=16|issue=12|pages=317&amp;ndash;324}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Alfred J. Lotka]], is one of a variety of special applications of [[Zipf's law]].  It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  contributions in a given period is a fraction of the number making a single contribution, following the formula  &lt;math&gt;1/x^{a}&lt;/math&gt;  where ''a'' nearly always equals two, i.e., an approximate [[inverse-square law]], where the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article.  As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent.  There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc.  Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are discipline-specific.

[[File:Lotka plot.png|thumb|Graphical plot of the Lotka function described in the text, with C=1, n=2]]
The general formula says:
:&lt;math&gt;
X^n Y = C
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = C / X^n, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' is the number of publications, ''Y'' the relative frequency of authors with ''X'' publications, and ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are constants depending on the specific field (&lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt;).

== Example ==
Say 100 authors write at least one article each over a specific period, we assume for this table that C=100 and n=2. Then the number of authors writing portions of any particular articles in that time period is describe as in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Portion of articles written
! Number of authors writing that number of articles
|-----
| 10 || 100/10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
|-----
| 9 || 100/9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1 (1.23)
|-----
| 8 || 100/8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (1.56)
|-----
| 7 || 100/7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (2.04)
|-----
| 6 || 100/6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3 (2.77)
|-----
| 5 || 100/5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4
|-----
| 4 || 100/4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 6 (6.25)
|-----
| 3 || 100/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 11 (11.111...)
|-----
| 2 || 100/2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25
|-----
| 1 || 100
|}

That would be a total of 294 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.

This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result.  This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".&lt;ref name=discreteLotka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egghe |first=Leo |year=2005

'''Lunar orbit rendezvous''' ('''LOR''') is a key concept for efficiently landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth. It was utilized for the [[Project Apollo]] missions in the 1960s and 1970s. In a LOR mission, a main [[spacecraft]] and a smaller lunar lander travel to [[lunar orbit]]. The lunar lander then independently descends to the surface of the Moon, while the main spacecraft remains in lunar orbit. After completion of the mission there, the lander returns to lunar orbit to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and re-[[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the main spacecraft, then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload. Only the main spacecraft returns to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vB7AA7B9hTI|"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous" - 1968 - NASA Mission Planning and Analysis Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LOR Gravity Well.png|thumb|Representation of the lunar [[gravity well]], illustrating how resources needed only for the trip home don't have to be carried down and back up the "well"]]
Lunar orbit rendezvous was first known to be proposed in 1919 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineer [[Yuri Kondratyuk]],{{sfnp|Harvey|2007|p=6—7}} as the most economical way of sending a human on a round-trip journey to the Moon.{{sfnp|Wilford|1969|p=41-48}}

[[File:Shuttleclunar.svg|thumb|LOR using [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]]]]
The most famous example involved [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]], where they were both sent to a Translunar flight in a single rocket stack. However, variants where the landers and main spacecraft travel separately, such as the lunar landing plan proposed for [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]] and [[Golden Spike Company|Golden Spike]], are also considered as Lunar Orbit rendezvous.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
[[File:Comparison of Lander Sizes - Direct vs LOR.gif|thumb|Comparison of lunar lander sizes, from an early Langley study]]
The main advantage of LOR is the spacecraft payload saving, due to the fact that the propellant necessary to return from lunar orbit back to Earth need not be carried as dead weight down to the Moon and back into lunar orbit. This has a multiplicative effect, because each pound of "dead weight" propellant used later has to be propelled by more propellant sooner, and also because increased propellant requires increased tankage weight. The resultant weight increase would also require more thrust for lunar landing, which means larger and heavier engines.{{sfnp|Reeves|2005}}

Another advantage is that the lunar lander can be designed for just that purpose, rather than requiring the main spacecraft to also be made suitable for a lunar landing. Finally, the second set of life support systems that the lunar lander requires can serve as a backup for the systems in the main spacecraft.

===Disadvantage===
Lunar-orbit rendezvous was considered risky as of 1962, because [[space rendezvous]] had not been achieved, even in Earth orbit. If the LEM could not reach the CSM, two astronauts would be stranded with no way to get back to Earth or survive [[atmospheric entry|re-entry into the atmosphere]]. The fear proved to be unfounded, as rendezvous was successfully demonstrated in 1965 and 1966 on six [[Project Gemini]] missions{{refn|group=Note|[[Gemini 6A]], [[Gemini 8]], [[Gemini 9A]], [[Gemini 10]], [[Gemini 11]], and [[Gemini 12]]}} with the aid of radar and on-board computers. It was also successfully done each of the eight times it was tried on Apollo missions.{{refn|group=Note|[[Apollo 9]] in Earth orbit; in lunar orbit on [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]], and [[Apollo 17]].}}

== Apollo Mission mode selection ==
[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] Lunar Module rendezvousing with Command Module in lunar orbit]]
When the Apollo Moon landing program was started in 1961, it was assumed that the three-man [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command and Service Module combination]] (CSM) would be used for takeoff from the lunar surface, and return to Earth. It would therefore have to be landed on the Moon by a larger rocket stage with landing gear legs, resulting in a very large spacecraft (in excess of {{convert|100000|lb|kg}}) to be sent to the Moon.

If this were done by [[direct ascent]] (on a single [[launch vehicle]]), the rocket required would have to be extremely large, in the [[Nova rocket|Nova]] class. The alternative to this would have been [[Earth orbit rendezvous]], in which two or more rockets in the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn class]] would launch parts of the complete spacecraft, which would rendezvous in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon. This would possibly include a separately launched Earth departure stage, or require on-orbit refueling of the empty departure stage.

[[Tom Dolan (engineer)|Tom Dolan]]{{sfnp|Brooks|1979}} proposed the alternative of lunar orbit rendezvous, which had been studied and promoted by [[Jim Chamberlin]] and [[Owen Maynard]] at the [[Space Task Group]] in 1960 early Apollo feasibility studies.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|p=62-66}} This mode allowed a single [[Saturn V]] to launch the CSM to the Moon with a smaller [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Excursion Module]] (LEM).{{refn|group=Note|This was shortened to "Lunar Module" (LM) in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, Julian W. (Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, NASA). Memorandum from Project Designation Committee, June 9, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}} When the combined spacecraft reaches [[lunar orbit]], one of the three astronauts remains with the CSM, while the other two enter the LEM, undock and descend to the surface of the Moon. They then use the ascent stage of the LEM to rejoin the CSM in lunar orbit, then discard the LEM and use the CSM for the return to Earth. This method was brought to the attention of NASA Associate Administrator [[Robert Seamans]] by [[Langley Research Center]] engineer [[John Houbolt|John C. Houbolt]], who led a team to develop it.

Besides requiring less payload, the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach. The LEM's design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the surface, as opposed to being on their backs in a Command Module lander, at least {{convert|40|or|50|ft|m}} above the surface, able to see it only through a television screen.

Developing the LEM as a second manned vehicle provided the further advantage of redundant critical systems (electrical power, life support, and propulsion), which enabled it to be used as a "lifeboat" to keep the astronauts alive and get them home safely in the event of a critical CSM system failure. This was envisioned as a contingency, but not made a part of the LEM specifications. As it turned out, this capability proved invaluable in 1970, when just such a critical failure occurred on the [[Apollo 13]] mission when an oxygen tank failure disabled the Service Module.

[[File:John C. Houbolt - GPN-2000-001274.jpg|thumb|[[John Houbolt]] explains Lunar orbit rendezvous]]
Dr. John Houbolt would not let the advantages of LOR be ignored. As a member of Lunar Mission Steering Group, Houbolt had been studying various technical aspects of [[space rendezvous]] since 1959 and was convinced, like several others at [[Langley Research Center]], that LOR was not only the most feasible way to make it to the Moon before the decade was out, it was the only way. He had reported his findings to [[NASA]] on various occasions but felt strongly that the internal task forces (to which he made presentations) were following arbitrarily established "ground rules." According to Houbolt, these ground rules were constraining NASA's thinking about the lunar mission—and causing LOR to be ruled out before it was fairly considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 1961, Houbolt took the bold step of skipping proper channels and writing a private letter, nine pages long, directly to [[Robert C. Seamans]], the associate administrator. "Somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," Houbolt protested LOR's exclusion. "Do we want to go to the Moon or not?" the Langley engineer asked. "Why is Nova, with its ponderous size simply just accepted, and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive? I fully realize that contacting you in this manner is somewhat unorthodox," Houbolt admitted, "but the issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted."{{sfnp|Tennant|2009}}{{sfnp|Hansen|1995}}

It took two weeks for Seamans to reply to Houbolt's extraordinary letter. The associate administrator agreed that "it would be extremely harmful to our organization and to the country if our qualified staff were unduly limited by restrictive guidelines." He assured Houbolt that NASA would in the future be paying more attention to LOR than it had up to this time.

In the following months, NASA did just that, and to the surprise of many both inside and outside the agency, the dark horse candidate, LOR, quickly became the front runner. Several factors decided the issue in its favor. First, there was growing disenchantment with the idea of [[direct ascent]] due to the time and money it was going to take to develop a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Nova (rocket)|Nova rocket]], compared to the {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Saturn V]]. Second, there was increasing technical apprehension over how the relatively large spacecraft demanded even by Earth-orbit rendezvous would be able to maneuver to a soft landing on the Moon. As one NASA engineer who changed his mind explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;The business of eyeballing that thing down to the Moon really didn't have a satisfactory answer. The best thing about LOR was that it allowed us to build a separate vehicle for landing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first major group to break camp in favor of LOR was [[Robert R. Gilruth|Robert Gilruth]]'s Space Task Group, which was still located at Langley but was soon to move to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Houston]]. The second to come over was the [[Wernher von Braun|Von Braun]] team at the  [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Then these two powerful groups of converts, along with the original true believers at Langley, persuaded key officials at NASA Headquarters, notably Administrator [[James E. Webb|James Webb]], who had been holding out for direct ascent, that LOR was the only way to land on the Moon by 1969. With the key players inside NASA lined up behind the concept, Webb approved LOR in July 1962.{{sfnp|Witkin|1962}} The decision was officially announced at a press conference on July 11, 1962.{{sfnp|NASA|1962|p=1}} President Kennedy's science adviser, [[Jerome Wiesner]], remained firmly opposed to LOR.{{sfnp|Nelson|2009|p=209—210}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program - NASA|last=|first=|date=December 1992|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|id=Fact Sheet NF175|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;!-- This NASA Facts was prepared by the NASA Langley Research Center Office of Public Affairs, with the assistance of Dr. James R.

==Other plans using LOR==
*The proposed Soviet Lunar Landing plan, using the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]], [[LK (spacecraft)|LK Lander]] and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] would have used a similar LOR mission profile.
*The cancelled [[Constellation program]] Lunar Landing would have used a combination of [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] and Lunar Rendezvous.
*A robotic lunar orbit rendezvous is planned for use by the Chinese [[Chang'e 5]] lunar sample return mission scheduled in 2019.{{sfnp|Laxman|2012}}

'''Marcel Gilles Jozef Minnaert''' (12 February 1893 &amp;ndash; 26 October 1970) was a Dutch [[astronomer]] of [[Belgium|Belgian]] origin. He was born in [[Bruges]] and died in [[Utrecht]].

==Biography==
Minnaert obtained a [[PhD]] in [[biology]] at [[Ghent University]] in 1914. Later he obtained also a [[PhD]] in [[physics]] from Utrecht University, under the supervision of [[Leonard Ornstein]].

He was a supporter of the [[Flemish movement]] during [[World War I]] and endorsed the replacement of [[French language|French]] by [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during the [[Western Front (World War I)|German occupation of Belgium]]. He worked as "lector fysica" at the new Flemish University of Ghent, which was made possible by the support of the German occupation forces, and was viewed as connivance with the enemy by the reestablished Belgian authorities. Because of this, he was sentenced after the war in absence to 15 years of forced labor. However, Minnaert had anticipated this outcome by fleeing Belgium in time.

In 1918, he found a position at [[Utrecht University]] in the [[Netherlands]], 
initially to do [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] research. In [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], he became interested in [[astronomy]], and he became a pioneer of [[sun|solar]] research. He specialized in [[spectroscopy]] and the study of [[stellar atmosphere]]s and invented the spectroscopic [[curve of growth]].

Minnaert was also interested in [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] and musical nature of the sounds made by running water. In 1933 he published a solution for the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[resonance frequency]] of a single bubble in water, the so-called [[Minnaert resonance]].

In 1937, he was appointed director of the stellar observatory ''[[Sonnenborgh Observatory|Sonnenborgh]]'' in Utrecht and full professor in astronomy at the university.  In 1940, he published his famous [[Utrecht Atlas]] of the solar spectrum. In 1941, he invented the [[Minnaert function]], which is used in optical measurements of celestial bodies.

During the German occupation of the Netherlands in [[World War II]], he was imprisoned by the 
Germans because of his left-wing, anti-[[fascist]] sympathies.  During his incarceration, he taught [[physics]] and astronomy to his fellow prisoners. After the War, he was one of the founders of the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematisch Centrum]] in Amsterdam.

In 1946 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001901 |title=Marcel Gilles Jozef Minnaert (1893 - 1970) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications==
One of his interests was the effects of the atmosphere on light and images.  His classic book on this subject was originally published in Dutch in 1937 as ''De natuurkunde van 't vrije veld.  Licht en kleur in het landschap''.  It was released in English translation as:
*''The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air'', Dover, 1954, {{ISBN|0-486-20196-1}}
and in a new translation with color photographs as:
*''Light and Color in the Outdoors'', Springer, 1993, {{ISBN|0-387-97935-2}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97935-2}}, {{ISBN|0-387-94413-3}}.

'''Mercury-Atlas 5''' was an American unmanned [[spaceflight]] of the [[Mercury program]]. It was launched on November 29, 1961 with [[Enos (chimpanzee)|Enos]], a [[chimpanzee]], aboard. The craft orbited the [[Earth]] twice and splashed down about {{convert|200|mi}} south of [[Bermuda]].

==History==
By November 1961, the [[Soviet Union]] had launched [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Gherman Titov]] into [[orbit]] during the [[Vostok 1]] and [[Vostok 2]] manned [[orbital flight]]s while the United States had managed only suborbital ones. At that time [[NASA]] was still debating placing a chimpanzee in orbit as part of the [[Mercury-Atlas]] subprogram, with NASA headquarters questioning the wisdom of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] launching another unmanned Mercury mission. 

The [[Office of Public Affairs|NASA Public Affairs Office]] issued a press release stating "The men in charge of Project Mercury have insisted on orbiting the [[chimpanzee]] as a necessary preliminary checkout of the entire Mercury program before risking a human astronaut." prior to the flight.&lt;ref name="ShepardsRide"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm| title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury| format=url| publisher=[[NASA]]| work=Published as NASA Special Publication-4201 in the [[NASA History Series]]| year=1989| first1=Loyd S.| last1=Swenson Jr.| first2=James M.| last2=Grimwood| first3=Charles C.| last3=Alexander| editor1-first=David| editor1-last=Woods| editor2-first=Chris| editor2-last=Gamble| accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch and orbit==
[[File:Chimpanzee Enos before the flight of Mercury-Atlas 5.jpg|thumb|left|Enos in his flight couch, being prepared for insertion into his Mercury capsule]]
The flight used Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] #9 and [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas]] #93-D. On February 24, 1961 spacecraft # 9 arrived at [[Cape Canaveral]]. It took 40 weeks of preflight preparation. This was the longest preparation time in the [[Mercury program]]. The mission of spacecraft #9 kept changing. It was first configured for a suborbital instrumented flight, then for a suborbital chimpanzee flight, then a three-orbit instrumented mission, and finally for the orbital flight that Enos flew.

MA-4's successful flight in September had renewed confidence in the Atlas's reliability, and although an Atlas E test carrying a monkey was lost in a launch failure that November, NASA officials assured the public that it was a different model of booster than the Atlas D used for the Mercury program and that that accident had no relevance here.
Although MA-4 had performed well, there was still some concern about high vibration levels during the first 20 seconds of liftoff, so the autopilot on MA-5's booster was modified slightly to correct this problem.

Atlas 93D arrived at CCAS on August 12 and was erected on LC-14 October 6. Prelaunch preparation proceeded relatively smoothly, with a number of minor repairs, including a potentially serious problem with the vernier engines not being bolted in place tightly, which could have resulted in damage to the airframe during launch.

The Range Safety system on Atlas 93D was modified so that a manual cutoff command could be sent to the sustainer engine. This was to prevent the capsule from being accidentally boosted into a higher than planned orbit if engine over-acceleration occurred.

A more compact all-solid state telemetry unit replaced the bulky vacuum tube-based package used previously.

Atlas 93D was the second D-series Atlas to contain the new SMRD (Spin Motor Rotation Detection System), designed to ensure proper gyroscope operation prior to launch.

MA-5 was planned as a close approximation of the upcoming MA-6 manned orbital mission. Mercury-Atlas 5 would be launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Complex 14]] at [[Cape Canaveral]] on a heading 72.51 degrees east of north. Orbital insertion of the Mercury spacecraft would occur {{convert|480|mi|km}} from Cape Canaveral. The altitude would be {{convert|100|mi|km}} and the speed would be {{convert|25695|ft/s|m/s}}. Retrofire was planned to take place at 4 hours, 32 minutes, and 26 seconds after launch. The spacecraft would land 21 minutes and 49 seconds after retrofire. Reentry temperatures were expected to reach {{convert|3000|°F|°C}} on the heatshield, {{convert|2000|°F|°C}} on the antenna housing, {{convert|1080|°F|°C}} on the cylindrical section, and {{convert|1260|°F|°C}} on the conical section. The spent Atlas sustainer engine was expected to reenter the atmosphere after 9⅓ orbits.

Spacecraft #9 had originally been intended to fly on MA-4, but Spacecraft #8 was used instead after having been recycled from the failed MA-3 launch. #9 was the second of the "Mark II" Mercury capsules with a larger square window and explosive bolt hatch, while the older "Mark I" capsule had small port windows and a heavy locking mechanism. [[Gus Grissom]]'s flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.

On October 29, 1961, three chimps and 12 medical specialists moved into quarters at the Cape to prepare for the flight. The name given to Enos, the chimp selected to fly the MA-5 mission, in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means "man". Enos's backups were (in order of possible call-up) Duane, Jim, Rocky, and [[Ham (chimpanzee)|Ham]], (the [[Mercury-Redstone 2]] veteran). Enos was from [[Cameroon]], Africa, (originally called Chimp # 81), and was purchased by the USAF on April 3, 1960. He was about 5 years old at the time of flight and weighed just under 40 pounds (18 kilograms).

On November 29, 1961, about five hours before launch, Enos and his [[spacesuit]]-couch were inserted in the spacecraft. During the [[countdown]], various holds took 2 hours and 38 minutes. [[Takeoff|Liftoff]] came at 15:08 [[UTC]]. The Atlas launched the MA-5 spacecraft into an orbit of {{convert|99|by|147|mi|km}}. The modified autopilot apparently worked as vibration remained within comfortable levels and the boost phase was uneventful. All Atlas systems performed excellently and there were no performance deviations of any significance. BECO occurred at T+130 seconds and SECO/VECO at T+300 seconds, followed by capsule separation two seconds later.

The turnaround and [[damping]] maneuver consumed {{convert|6|lb|kg}} of the {{convert|61.5|lb|kg}} of control [[fuel]] aboard. The spacecraft used less fuel than the MA-4 did during the same maneuver. MA-5 assumed its planned 34-degree [[Spacecraft#Subsystems|orbital attitude]] and after that, through the first [[Geocentric orbit|orbit]] the [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] used only {{convert|1.5|lb|kg}} of fuel to maintain a correct position.

At the end of the first orbit, ground controllers noticed the [[space capsule|capsule]] clock was 18 seconds too fast. As it passed over Cape Canaveral a command was sent to update the clock to the correct time. The [[Mission Control Center (NASA)#The early days .281960–1964.29|Mercury Control Center]] at Cape Canaveral received information that all [[Spacecraft#Subsystems|spacecraft systems]] were in good condition.

As the MA-5 passed over the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] tracking ship at the beginning of the second orbit, indications were received that inverter temperatures were rising. The [[environmental control system]] malfunction was also confirmed by [[Canary Island]] trackers. Abnormal heating had occurred on earlier flights; in such cases, inverters had continued working or had been switched to standby. There was no alarm at Mercury Control. When the spacecraft reached [[Muchea Tracking Station|Muchea]], Australia, high thruster signals and capsule motion excursions were detected. Other data indicated that the 34° orbit mode was being maintained. When the MA-5 crossed the tracking station at [[Woomera, Australia]], attitude control problems were not detected, so earlier reports were discounted.

===Problems===
As the MA-5 capsule reached the [[Canton Island]] station, Mercury Control realized that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A metal chip in a fuel supply line had caused one of the clockwise roll [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34° orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 ''g'' (0.49&amp;nbsp;m/s²) light telemetry signal. The remaining thrusters used {{convert|9.5|lb|kg}} of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit. Each loss of attitude cost over {{convert|1|lb|kg}} of fuel as compared with the entire first orbit consumption of only {{convert|1.5|lb|kg}}.

In addition to the attitude control problems, the environmental control system started having problems during the second orbit. The couch-suit circuit temperature rapidly rose from {{convert|65|to|80|F|C}}. This was an indication that the heat exchanger was freezing. The rise in suit temperature caused Enos' body temperature to rise to {{convert|99|°F|°C}}, then to {{convert|100|°F|°C}}. The medical observers began to worry about the chimp's condition. At {{convert|100.5|°F|°C}}, his body temperature stabilized. This indicated that the environmental system had started to function again. The cooling system seemed to correct itself, but the attitude problems continued.

As the spacecraft neared Hawaii on its second orbit, medical monitors were willing to let Enos continue the flight for a third orbit. However, the engineering team were concerned about the stuck thruster causing high fuel consumption, so they advised terminating the flight before the capsule ran out of attitude control gas.

[[Flight controller#Flight Director .28FLIGHT.29|Flight Director]] [[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.|Christopher Kraft]] alerted the Hawaii controllers to be ready to initiate retrofire to bring the spacecraft down in the Pacific, if necessary. He also alerted controllers at [[Point Arguello]], California, to be ready to initiate retrofire as MA-5 passed over their position. He allowed the spacecraft to continue to its normal second orbit retrofire position near California. Twelve seconds before the retrofire point was reached for the normal second-orbit Atlantic primary recovery point, Kraft decided to bring Enos back to Earth. Arnold Aldrich, the chief flight controller at Point Arguello executed the command.

There was one more attitude control excursion early in reentry; after that, the rest of reentry and recovery were uneventful. The destroyers {{USS|Stormes|DD-780|6}} and {{USS|Compton|DD-705|6}} and a [[P5M Marlin|P5M]] aircraft were waiting for the spacecraft at Station 8, the predicted landing point. Three hours and 13 minutes after launch and nine minutes before splashdown, the aircraft spotted the spacecraft at an altitude of {{convert|5000|ft|m}} descending on its main parachute. The information was relayed to ''Stormes'' and ''Compton'', who were {{convert|30|mi|km}} away. The spacecraft recovery aids were all functioning, except for the [[Survival radio#VHF era|SARAH beacon]]. During the descent, the aircraft continued to circle and report landing events. It remained in the area until ''Stormes'' arrived, an hour and 15 minutes after the landing. ''Stormes'' hauled Enos and his spacecraft aboard. On the deck of ''Stormes'', the MA-5 hatch was blown explosively. It was released from outside the capsule by pulling a lanyard. Blowing the hatch caused the spacecraft "picture" window to crack.

==Post-landing==
[[File:Mercury-Atlas 5 display.jpg|thumb|Mercury spacecraft # 9, used in the Mercury-Atlas 5 mission, on display at the [[Museum of Life and Science]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/mercury/MA-5.html| title=Mercury spacecraft #9 display page on A Field Guide to American Spacecraft website| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503071731/http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/mercury/MA-5.html| archivedate=May 3, 2009| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The spacecraft and Enos were both found to have survived the mission in good condition, although the chimp had removed all of the medical electrodes and the urine collection device from his body.

On November 4, 1962, Enos died of dysentery caused by [[shigellosis]], which was resistant to antibiotics of the time. He had been under constant observation for two months before his death. Pathologists at Holloman reported that they found no symptom that could be attributed or related to his space flight a year before.

The Mercury spacecraft and Atlas booster had now been qualified to carry a human into orbit.

'''''Metaviridae''''' are a family of [[virus]]es which exist as [[retrotransposon]]s in a [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] host’s genome. They are closely related to [[retrovirus]]es: Metaviridae share many genomic elements with retroviruses, including length, organization, and genes themselves. This includes genes that encode [[reverse transcriptase]], [[integrase]], and [[capsid]] proteins. The reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins are needed for the retrotransposon activity of the virus. In some cases, virus-like particles can be formed from capsid proteins.

Some assembled Metaviridae particles can penetrate and infect previously uninfected cells. An example of this is the gypsy, a retroelement found in the ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' genome. The ability to infect other cells in determined by the presence of the retroviral ''env'' genes which encode coat proteins.

==Taxonomy==

Metaviridae are split into the following genera:
*Genus ''[[Metavirus]]''; type species: ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty3 virus]]''
*Genus ''[[Errantivirus]]''; type species: ''[[Drosophila melanogaster gypsy virus]]''

Families ''Metaviridae'', ''[[Belpaoviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'', ''[[Retroviridae]]'', and ''[[Caulimoviridae]]'' constitute the order ''[[Ortervirales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krupovic|first1=M|last2=Blomberg|first2=J|last3=Coffin|first3=JM|last4=Dasgupta|first4=I|last5=Fan|first5=H|last6=Geering|first6=AD|last7=Gifford|first7=R|last8=Harrach|first8=B|last9=Hull|first9=R|last10=Johnson|first10=W|last11=Kreuze|first11=JF|last12=Lindemann|first12=D|last13=Llorens|first13=C|last14=Lockhart|first14=B|last15=Mayer|first15=J|last16=Muller|first16=E|last17=Olszewski|first17=N|last18=Pappu|first18=HR|last19=Pooggin|first19=M|last20=Richert-Pöggeler|first20=KR|last21=Sabanadzovic|first21=S|last22=Sanfaçon|first22=H|last23=Schoelz|first23=JE|last24=Seal|first24=S|last25=Stavolone|first25=L|last26=Stoye|first26=JP|last27=Teycheney|first27=PY|last28=Tristem|first28=M|last29=Koonin|first29=EV|last30=Kuhn|first30=JH|title=''Ortervirales'': A new viral order unifying five families of reverse-transcribing viruses.|journal=Journal of Virology|date=4 April 2018|doi=10.1128/JVI.00515-18|pmid=29618642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael J. Quigley''' is a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon. He is a former member of the [[United States Army]] and an officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve]], once a senior high-value detainee interrogator, who now addresses the human rights implications of counter-terrorism operations and the USA's use of torture and other inhumane and coercive interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=HrfQuigley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ria2014-08-05/&gt;
Quigley enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1989, becoming a [[military policeman]] after a short time as a foot soldier.&lt;ref name=SherlockianQuigley/&gt;
After transferring from the military police corps to military intelligence, Quigley became one of the Army's most skilled and experienced interrogators and experts in [[counter-terrorism]].  In 1998 Quigley served as an advisor to [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], when Mitchell was assisting in the negotiations that ended the [[United Kingdom]]'s strife with the [[Irish Republican Army]]—resulting in the ''"[[Good Friday Peace Accords]]"''.

While serving in Iraq, during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], Quigley left the Army and accepted a [[direct commission]] into the [[United States Navy Reserve]] in August 2003.&lt;ref name=SherlockianQuigley/&gt;  
Following his deployment in Iraq Quigley accepted a job as a civilian counter-terrorism analyst at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].  Quigley was part of a team assigned to interrogate the ''"[[high-value detainees]]"'' at Guantanamo, including Abd'l Hadi al-Iraqi, a senior leader of al-Qaeda, and formerly a captive held by the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name=TheHill2014-08-02&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="725">A '''mining simulator''' is a system used to replicate elements of [[mining]] operations, for [[training]] or efficiency analysis. Mining simulation application can range from pure statistical analysis, to scale models, all the way to replica cabins of mining machinery mounted on [[pneumatic]] actuators surrounded by screens displaying [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] imagery. These simulators rely on [[physics engine]]s and [[geodata]] to accurately simulate the dynamics of the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">'''Numerical taxonomy'''  is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title=Numerical Taxonomy (biology) |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to create a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] and [[Peter H. A. Sneath]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Sokal &amp; Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications are based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa.{{cn span|In recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors.|date=May 2017}}

Although intended as an objective method, in practice the choice and implicit or explicit [[weighting]] of characteristics is influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create [[dendrogram]]s and [[cladogram]]s using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2343">'''Regenerative economics''' is an [[economic system]] that works to regenerate [[capital assets]]. A capital asset is an asset that provides goods and/or services that are required for, or contribute to, our [[well being]]. In standard [[economic theory]], one can either “regenerate” one's capital assets or consume them until the point where the asset cannot produce a viable stream of goods and/or services. What sets regenerative economics apart from standard economic theory is that it takes into account and gives hard economic value to the principal or original capital assets — the [[earth]] and the [[sun]]. We cannot do much to affect the sun although we can value access to the sun in such areas where access can be influenced. Therefore, most of Regenerative Economics focuses on the earth and the [[goods and services]] it supplies.

Regenerative economics is completely comfortable within the capitalist economic framework. Recognizing the earth as the original capital asset places the true value on the human support system known as the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Not having this original value properly recognized has created the unsustainable economic condition referred to as [[uneconomic growth]], a phrase coined by leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], as stated in the book Reshaping the [[Built Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Reshaping the Built Environment, edited by Charles J. Kibert, Forward by Alex Wilson, Written by Herman E. Daly Copyright 1999, Island Press {{ISBN|1-55963-701-3}}, {{ISBN|1-55963-702-1}}, Chapter 5 Uneconomic Growth and the Built Environment, In Theory and in Fact. pages 73–88&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the regenerative economic theory believe that uneconomic growth is the opposite of regenerative economics.

'''Self-affirmation''' theory is a [[psychology|psychological]] theory that focuses on how individuals adapt to information or experiences that are threatening to their [[self-concept]]. [[Claude Steele]] originally popularized self-affirmation theory in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"&gt;Steele, C. M. (1988). The psychology of self-affirmation: Sustaining the integrity of the self. Advances in experimental social psychology, 21, 261-302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2007). Self-affirmation theory. In R. Baumeister and K. Vohs (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Social Psychology (pp. 787-789). Thousand Oakes: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a well-studied theory in [[Social psychology|social psychological]] research.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"&gt;Sherman, D. K., &amp; Cohen, G. L. (2006). The psychology of self-defense: Self-affirmation theory. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.) Advances in experimental social psychology, 38, pp. 183-242. New York, NY: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"&gt;McQueen, A., &amp; Klein, W. M. (2006). Experimental manipulations of self-affirmation: A systematic review. Self and Identity, 5(4), 289-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self.

Experimental investigations of self-affirmation theory suggest that self-affirmation can help individuals cope with threat or stress and that it might be beneficial for improving academic performance, health, and reducing defensiveness.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2014). The psychology of change: Self-affirmation and social psychological intervention. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 333-371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are four main principles of self-affirmation theory.

===People try to protect their self-integrity===
Self-affirmation theory proposes that individuals are driven to protect their self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; According to self-affirmation theory, self-integrity is one's concept of oneself as a good, moral person, who acts in ways that are in accord with cultural and social norms. Steele purported that the self is made up of different domains: roles, values, and belief systems.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt; Roles include responsibilities a person has, such as being a parent, friend, student, or professional. Values are aspirations people live in accordance to, including things like living healthfully and treating others with respect. Belief systems include the ideologies to which a person ascribes, such as religious or political beliefs. Self-integrity can take many forms.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, self-integrity can take the form of being independent, intelligent, a helpful member of a society, part of a family, and/or part of a group. Threats against a person's self-integrity are events or messages that imply an individual is not good or adequate in a personally relevant domain. Self-affirmation theory suggests that when individuals face threat to one of these domains, they are motivated to maintain a positive global image of themselves.

===Drives to protect the sense of self are often defensive===
Self-affirmation theory purports that when individuals are faced with information that threatens their self-integrity, the response to this information is often defensive in nature.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;  Defensive reactions attempt to minimize the threat in order to preserve the sense of self. Examples of defensive reactions include denial, avoiding the threat, and changing one's appraisal of the event in order to make it less threatening.

===Self-integrity is flexible===
Instead of having one self-concept (e.g., I am a good parent), self-affirmation theory posits that individuals flexibly define who they are using various roles (e.g., I am a good parent, child, and worker).  Having a flexible sense of self allows individual to offset weaknesses in one domain, by highlighting the strengths in another domain.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; That is, if someone perceives threat to one domain, he or she can accommodate this threat by upholding a value in another domain. Self-affirmations can come from many sources. Having a flexible self-concept allows people to adapt in the face of threat.

===Actions that promote one's values can reduce perceived threat===
It is theorized that engaging in activities that promote the values, beliefs, and roles that are central to an individual's identity can promote self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"/&gt; Promoting one's values can affirm the individual and reduce the perceived threat. Engaging in such actions when facing threat serves to remind individuals of the broad, principal values by which they define themselves and their lives.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; This change in perspective shifts attention away from the threat in one domain of the self toward a larger context of who they are. It is thought that when people operate from this broader perspective, they  react less defensively to the threat, which allows them to act more effectively.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; Self-Affirmations can occur by both reflecting on a personally relevant value, belief, or role, as well as engaging in an activity that might evoke a personally relevant value, such as spending time with family if that is personally relevant.

Taken together, the four principles suggest that when confronted with information that threatens  self-concept, the person experiences distress and is subsequently motivated to self-defense. However, the defensive reaction can impede more adaptive ways to solve the problem (like engaging in problem-solving or changing unhealthy behaviors). It is thought that affirming an important value unrelated to the threat helps individuals to shift their perspective to their broader life context. Having a broad viewpoint diminishes the perceived threat, allowing individuals to act less defensively and more effectively.

==Paradigms used to study self-affirmation theory==
In laboratory experiments, psychologists induce self-affirmation in participants in order to investigate the influence of self-affirmation on individuals' well-being. There are two chief methods used to self-affirm  participants in experimental studies.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt;

===Values Essay===
One of the most common ways to induce self-affirmation is to have participants write about a personally relevant value.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; In order to do this, participants rank a list of values from most important to least important to them. The list typically includes the following value domains, business, art/music/theater, social life/relationships, science/pursuit of knowledge, religion/morality, and government/politics. Participants then write about the value they ranked as most important and how it is meaningful to them for 10 minutes.

===Values List===
The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values Scale &lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., Vernon, P. E., &amp; Lindzey, G. E. (1960). Study of values: A scale for measuring the dominant interests in personality. Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; is another measures that is administered to participants to induce self-affirmation in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; Participants choose one of two answers after reading a statement about a value. An example item from the religion scale would be “The more important study for mankind is (a) mathematics (b) theology”.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, R. A. (1968). The interpretation of the religious scale of the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey study of values. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 65-77&lt;/ref&gt; This allows researchers to see where an individual's personal interests and values lie. It is thought that answering questions about a value domain that they find important will make that value more salient to them, resulting in self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; There are six different value domains on the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values scale:  religion, theoretical, aesthetic, political, social, and economic.

==Empirical Support==
Extant empirical research demonstrates that self-affirmations can be beneficial in reducing individuals' [[Fight-or-flight response|stress response]] as well as their defensiveness toward threats.

===Self-affirmation buffering against stress===
In one study investigating the effects of self-affirmation on [[Flight-or-flight response|stress response]], undergraduate participants completed the [[Trier Social Stress Test]], a standardized laboratory paradigm used to induce stress in participants. In the Trier Social Stress task, participants are asked to give a short speech in front of a panel of judges who do not give any comments or positive feedback to the participant. Following the speech, participants must complete a mental arithmetic task, in which they count backwards from 2,083 in increments of 13 while being told by the judges to go faster. Prior to completing the Trier Social Stress Task, half of the participants completed a variation of values list self-affirmation task. Participants who completed the values list had significantly lower stress response than individuals in the control condition, as indicated by a lower [[cortisol]] response in affirmed participants compared to participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Welch, W. T., Taylor, S. E., Sherman, D. K., Gruenewald, T. L., &amp; Mann, T. (2005). Affirmation of personal values buffers neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses. Psychological Science, 16(11), 846-851&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different experiment, undergraduate students completed difficult problem solving puzzles in the presence of an evaluator. Participants also reported how much chronic stress they endured over the past month. Prior to completing the problem-solving puzzles half of the participants completed a values essay self-affirmation task. For the individuals who did not complete the self-affirmation task, low-stress participants performed significantly better than high-stress participants. For individuals in the self-affirmation condition, high-stress individuals performed equally as well as low-stress individuals. Findings suggest that self-affirmation buffered against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving performance.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Dutcher, J. M., Klein, W. M., Harris, P. R., &amp; Levine, J. M. (2013). Self-affirmation improves problem-solving under stress. PLoS ONE, 8(5), e62593&lt;/ref&gt;

For another experiment, undergraduates were recruited to participate in a research study two weeks prior to completing a mid-term exam. All participants collected urine samples for 24 hours two weeks prior to their midterm (baseline) as well as for the 24 hours prior to their midterm examination so levels their [[catecholamine]] levels could be measured. Catecholamine levels are thought to be high when individuals are experiencing higher stress.&lt;ref&gt;James, G. D., Crews, D. E., &amp; Pearson, J. (1989). Catecholamines and stress. Human population biology: a transdisciplinary science, 280-95&lt;/ref&gt; Half of participants completed two values essays in the two weeks leading up to their midterm examination. Participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition demonstrated increased catecholamine response from baseline to their midterm exam. However, participants who completed the two values essays did not show an increase in catecholamine levels from baseline to their midterm.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, D. K., Bunyan, D. P., Creswell, J. D., &amp; Jaremka, L. M. (2009). Psychological vulnerability and stress: the effects of self-affirmation on sympathetic nervous system responses to naturalistic stressors. Health Psychology, 28(5), 554&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary research results suggest that self-affirmation can protect against the negative consequences of stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"/&gt; More research is needed to understand ''how'' self-affirmations decrease stress responses.

===Self-affirmation reducing defensiveness===

Results from studies provide support for the idea that when individuals complete an activity that affirms their self-integrity they are less defensive and more accepting of information that is potentially threatening. However, more research is needed to better understand ''why'' people are more open-minded after they have completed an affirmation task.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Studies have examined the effects of self-affirmation on the academic performance of historically marginalized groups such as African American and Latino American students, who face a multitude of daily threats in the school environment.&lt;ref&gt;Steele CM. 2010. Whistling Vivaldi and Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh grade students took part in a two-year study. Half of the students completed a values essay about their most important value approximately seven to eight times over the course of two academic years, while the other half wrote a values essay about why their least important value might be of value to someone else. The study tracked the students' grades for three years. Ethnic minority students in the self-affirmation condition received higher grade point averages than the ethnic minority students who wrote about why their least important value might be important to someone else. There was no effect of self-affirmation in white students. Findings suggest that for students who face daily, repeated stressors at school, self-affirmation buffers against worsening school performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Apfel, N., &amp; Master, A. (2006).

Reducing the gender achievement gap in college science: a classroom study of values affirmation. Science 330:1234–37&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that self-affirmation can have a buffering effect on academic achievement for groups who face the most threat.

===Health===
Women concerned with their weight were recruited for a study. Concern with weight has similar effects of stress in that it can cause psychological distress, poor eating, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;Haines J, Neumark-Sztainer D, Wall M, Story M. 2007. Personal, behavioral, and environmental risk and protective factors for adolescent overweight. Obesity 15:2748–60&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the women completed a values essay. Self-affirmed participants had lost more weight, had lower [[body mass index]], and smaller waist circumference than non-affirmed women.&lt;ref&gt;Logel C, Cohen GL. 2012. The role of the self in physical health. Psychological Science. 23:53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with end stage [[Nephropathy|renal disease]] participated in a study assessing the effects of self-affirmation on adherence to [[phosphate binder]]s that facilitate control of phosphate levels. Poor phosphate control in this population can be dangerous and life-threatening.  There was a significant improvement in serum phosphate levels for the affirmed patients compared to the non-affirmed patients, suggesting better adherence to phosphate binders.&lt;ref&gt;Wileman, V., Farrington, K., Chilcot, J., Norton, S., Wellsted, D. M., Almond, M. K., ... &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2014). Evidence That Self-Affirmation Improves Phosphate Control in Hemodialysis Patients: A Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors that influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations==

===Culture===
[[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Individualist and collectivist cultures]] place different levels of importance on belonging to in-groups, and it is thought that this may vary the effects of self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; One study investigated the effects of self-affirmation on reducing [[cognitive dissonance]]. This study found that self-affirmed participants from individualist cultures saw reductions in cognitive dissonance, whereas self-affirmed participants from collectivist cultures did not experience a reduction in cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, S. J., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (1997). Culture, dissonance, and self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 389-400&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the effect on individuals from individualist and collectivist backgrounds of writing a values essay about a value that was important to the participant compared to a value that was important to the participant's family. The authors found reduced [[cognitive dissonance]] for participants from collectivist cultures who wrote about values important to them and their families, and found reduced cognitive dissonance for participants from individualist cultures who wrote about a value important to just them.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshino-Browne, E., Zanna, A. S., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Zanna, M. P. (2004). Investigating attitudes cross-culturally: A case of cognitive dissonance among East Asians and North Americans. In G. Haddock &amp; G. R. Maio (Eds.), Contemporary perspectives on the psychology of attitudes (pp. 375-397). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of the threatened domain===
Benefits from self-affirmation are thought to primarily occur when the perceived threat is in an area of importance to the individual.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, in the experiment detailed above in which coffee drinkers read an article about caffeine consumption and increased risk of breast cancer, self-affirmation only reduced defensiveness in individuals who were heavy coffee drinkers and not in occasional coffee drinkers.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2000"&gt;Sherman, D. A., Nelson, L. D., &amp; Steele, C. M. (2000). Do messages about health risks threaten the self? Increasing the acceptance of threatening health messages via self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 26(9), 1046-1058&lt;/ref&gt; Because an article on the risks associated with caffeine consumption might not pose the same threat to occasional coffee drinkers as to heavy coffee drinkers, self-affirmation likely does not provide the same benefit for occasional coffee drinkers. Thus, the importance of the threatened domain to one's self-integrity is thought to influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations.

==Factors underlying the effects of self-affirmation theory==
Research has not yet identified the underlying mechanisms of how self-affirmation buffers against stress and reduces defensiveness. However, it is believed that there is not just one factor responsible for the effects of self-affirmation, but rather many.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; To date, increasing positive emotions and self-esteem have been investigated as mechanisms of self-affirmation, but the findings are mixed. Some studies have found that positive mood brings about similar reductions in defensiveness as self-affirmations.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., Smeets, K., Van Knippenberg, A., &amp; Dijksterhuis, A. (1999). The cessation of rumination through self-affirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(1), 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raghunathan, R., &amp; Trope, Y. (2002). Walking the tightrope between feeling good and being accurate: mood as a resource in processing persuasive messages. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(3), 510&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, several studies fail to detect any effect of self-affirmation on mood, suggesting self-affirmation does not operate via increases in positive mood.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Lynch, M. (1993). Self-image resilience and dissonance: the role of affirmational resources. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(6), 885&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, results on the effects of self-affirmation on self-esteem are also mixed. Some studies have observed increases in self-esteem following self-affirmation,&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1), 31&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other have found no effect on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeichel, B. J., &amp; Martens, A. (2005). Self-affirmation and mortality salience: Affirming values reduces worldview defense and death-thought accessibility. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31(5), 658-667&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to better understand ''how'' self-affirmation can provide benefit to individuals.

'''Sergei Nikolaevich Alphéraky''' (1850–1918) (sometimes '''Alphéraki''' or '''Alferaki''') was a [[Russia]]n [[ornithologist]] and [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Lepidoptera]].

Sergei Alphéraky was born into the noble Greek family of Alferakis and was the brother of composer [[Achilles Alferaki]]. His father Nikos Alferakis owned the [[Alferaki Palace]] in [[Taganrog]]. Sergei studied at [[Moscow University]] (1867–1869), then with [[Otto Staudinger]] in [[Dresden]] (1871–1873). On his return to Russia he worked on the Lepidoptera of the [[Taganrog]], [[Rostov-on-Don]] region. He also collected in the North [[Caucasus]]. After that he devoted himself to the insects, especially Lepidoptera, of [[Central Asia]]. He worked on the Lepidoptera collected by [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]] in [[Tibet]] held by the [[Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Science]] and those collected by [[Grigorij Nikolaevich Potanin]] in [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] in the same institution. Later he studied the collections made by [[Alfred Otto Herz]] in [[Amur Oblast|Amur]], [[Korea]] and [[Kamchatka]], and those of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia|Nicholas Mikhailovich Romanoff]] (Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich), a friend from his two years at Moscow University. He was an honorary member of both the [[Russian Entomological Society]] and the [[Royal Entomological Society]] of London.

==Naming==
In June 2006 the student dust counter was named in honor of [[Venetia Burney|Venetia Phair (née Burney)]] who came up with the name Pluto in the 1930s as a girl, and she was given a plaque related to this naming in December, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20090508|title=New Horizons Team Remembers Venetia Phair, the 'Girl Who Named Pluto'|last=JHUAPL|work=New Horizons|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venetia suggested the name Pluto after the discovery of the new planet by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 at [[Lowell Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-pluto-got-its-name-180955912/|title=How Pluto Got Its Name|last=Thompson|first=Helen|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Pluto was selected in a vote by the observatory's astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-pluto-got-its-name-180955912/|title=How Pluto Got Its Name|last=Thompson|first=Helen|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the instrument was called the ''Student Dust Counter''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/free/2013/65101145.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''War and Peace in the Global Village''''' by [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Quentin Fiore]] is a collage of images and text that illustrates the effects of electronic media and new technology on man.  Marshall McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a major inspiration for this study of war throughout history as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future. (1st Ed.: Bantam, NY; reissued by [[Gingko Press]], 2001  {{ISBN|1-58423-074-6}}),

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

'''Wayne Paul Maddison''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, is a professor and [[Canada Research Chair]] at the departments of zoology and botany at the [[University of British Columbia]],&lt;ref name=lab/&gt; and the Scientific Director of the [[Beaty Biodiversity Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://beatymuseum.ubc.ca/about/contact|work=Beaty Biodiversity Museum|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research concerns the phylogeny, biodiversity, and evolution of [[jumping spider]]s (Salticidae), of which he has discovered new species and genera.

He has also done research in [[phylogenetic theory]], developing and perfecting various methods used in [[comparative biology]], such as character state inference in internal nodes through [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|maximum parsimony]],&lt;ref name=M89&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddison | first1 = W.
