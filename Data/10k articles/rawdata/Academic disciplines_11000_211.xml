'''''35 Bar and Grille LLC, et al. v. The City of San Antonio''''' was a court case in U.S. District court. The case addressed a city ordinance about the amount of bodily coverage needed by [[semi-nude dancer]]s in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. The case reached notoriety in international press when the press discovered that Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]]'s April 29, 2013 order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction was full of puns and [[double entendre]]s about stripping and sexuality. During its press coverage, the case was also known by the humorous title applied to the judge's opinion of the case, '''''The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini Top v The (More) Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pastie''''' (a reference to the song "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]").&lt;ref name = Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10030421/The-Itsy-Bitsy-Teeny-Weeny-Bikini-opinion-Texas-judge-issues-worlds-cheekiest-written-ruling.html | newspaper = The Telegraph (UK)| title =The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini opinion: Texas judge issues world's cheekiest written ruling| first = Daniel|last =  Easterman | date = 1 May 2013| accessdate = 2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2012, the city of San Antonio amended its city ordinances dealing with "[[sexually oriented business]]es", or SOBs. Among other changes, the amendment redefined "nudity" to include "a state of dress that fails to completely and opaquely cover...the entire female breast".&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=11508|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Chapter 21, Article IX|work=San Antonio, Texas, Code of Ordinances|publisher=Municode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas female dancers had previously been able to avoid being classified as "nude" by wearing [[pasties]] over their nipples, the new law required that they wear at minimum a [[Brassiere|bra]] or [[bikini]] top.&lt;ref name=kv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |author=Conger, Joe |title=San Antonio city hall redefines 'sexually-oriented business' |date=7 December 2012 |publisher=KVUE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505145227/http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any business not meeting that requirement had to seek a permit as a SOB.&lt;ref name=law/&gt; The law also augmented fines associated with failure to comply with these regulations.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt;

The amendments were proposed to address concerns from parents about the proximity of semi-nude dance clubs to schools.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt; Police Chief Bill McManus applauded the amendment because it simplified enforcement by eliminating legal "grey areas"; he also noted connections between the presence of such establishments and area crime rates.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|date=6 December 2012|publisher=KSAT|author=Venema, Paul|title=Sexually oriented business amendments passed by SA City Council|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620105717/http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[strip club]]s objected on the grounds that no consultation or public hearings had taken place prior to the amendments being passed.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Richard Deegear, a lawyer representing several establishments, noted that "This entire process has been a disappointment because there hasn't been any process to speak of" and stated that he intended to bring the matter to court.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Previous attempts by the city in 2005 to regulate these business had also been challenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|publisher=WOAI|date=4 December 2012|title=City to try again to regulate strip clubs|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630161854/http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|archive-date=2013-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
A case challenging the amendments was filed against the city on 11 January 2013 in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]. The plaintiffs in the case were: 35 Bar and Grille, LLC; C. B. Restaurants, Inc.; E &amp; I Enterprises, Inc.; Endless Music, LLC; FLWW, Inc.; Hacienda Club, LLC; KHG of San Antonio; Michael D's Restaurant San Antonio, Inc.; RCI Entertainment (San Antonio), Inc.; Sacolo, LTD.; Spiros Partnership, Ltd.; Tripolis Enterprises, Inc.; and the Players Club, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txwdce/5:2013cv00034/600906/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=35 Bar and Grille LLC, et. al. v. The City of San Antonio, Texas|publisher=Justia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was assigned to Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]] in February 2013. Biery had previously presided over a 2003 case involving nude dancing.&lt;ref name=current&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|date=8 February 2013|work=San Antonio Current|author=Barajas, Michael|title=Newsmonger: Strip-club regs still stalled, military still mishandling sexual assault reports|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210153916/http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|archive-date=2013-02-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaintiffs argued that the amendments violated their [[first amendment]] right to [[free speech in the United States|free speech]]. They also complained that forcing their dancers to be more covered would reduce the [[profit margin]] of their companies.&lt;ref name=fix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfixnow.com/2013/05/01/federal-judge-rules-san-antonio-strippers-must-wear-bikini-tops/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Federal judge warns San Antonio strippers must wear bikini tops|publisher=NewsFix}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.&lt;ref name=kabb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|date=29 April 2013|publisher=KABB Fox|author=Virgin, Yami|title=Bikini tops or pasties?|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503080818/http://foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|archive-date=2013-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February, Biery issued an order that the city not enforce the ordinance until the request for injunction was considered at a hearing.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

===Decision===
On 29 April 2013, Judge Biery issued a decision denying the request for an injunction.&lt;ref name=kabb/&gt; He found that the plaintiffs had not met the burden of proof to justify an injunction.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} His decision included a loose paraphrase of the Bible and other works of literature (for example ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'') and a photograph of "Miss Wiggles", a 1960s-era clothed exotic dancer, in addition to the usual case references.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=1, 3, 7}} The decision concluded "Should the parties choose to [[G-string|string]] this case out to trial on the merits, the Court encourages reasonable discovery [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] as they navigate the peaks and valleys of litigation, perhaps to reach a [[:wikt:happy ending|happy ending]]".{{sfn|Biery|2013|p=8}}

When discussing the importance of the argument, despite its playfulness, the press described the opinion as highlighting important problems in American society.&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt; In particular, Biery's opinion also highlighted the problems inherent with the assumptions from lawmakers about stemming crime related to Sexually Oriented Businesses writing:&lt;ref name = HP/&gt;
{{quote|While the court finds these businesses to be nefarious magnets of mischief, the court doubts several square inches of fabric will stanch the flow of violence and other secondary effects emanating from these businesses. Indeed, this case exposes the underbelly of America's Romanesque passion for entertainment, sex and money, sought to be covered with constitutional prophylaxis.}}

==Response==

In the press following the ruling, many newspapers commented on the humor and amount of careful use of suggestive language within the opinion. [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']] called the case "world's cheekiest written ruling".&lt;ref name =Telegraph/&gt; Similarly the [[Huffington Post]] business section called the case "one of the funniest, most eloquent court documents we've ever seen."&lt;ref name = HP&gt;{{cite news| title = Texas Judge's Order Upholding 'Bikini Tops For Strippers' Law Is Completely Hilarious| newspaper =The Huffington Post| first =Hunter|last = Stuart| date = April 30, 2013| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/texas-judge-bikini-strippers_n_3186442.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer representing the strip clubs expressed a similar opinion to the press when talking about the ruling telling local press "one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen".&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt;

'''Acoustic cleaning''' is a maintenance method used in [[Material handling equipment|material-handling]] and storage systems that handle [[Bulk material handling|bulk granular or particulate materials]], such as [[grain elevator]]s, to remove the buildup of material on surfaces.   Acoustic cleaning apparatus, usually built into the material-handling equipment,   works by generating powerful [[sound wave]]s which shake particulates loose from surfaces, reducing the need for manual cleaning.

==History and design ==
An acoustic cleaner consists of a sound source similar to an [[air horn]] found on trucks and trains, attached to the material-handling equipment, which directs a loud sound into the interior.  It is powered by compressed air rather than electricity so there is no danger of sparking, which could set off an explosion.  It consists of two parts:
*The acoustic driver.  In the driver, compressed air escaping past a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] causes it to vibrate, generating the sound.  It is usually made from solid machined [[stainless steel]].  The diaphragm, the only moving part, is usually manufactured from special aerospace grade titanium to ensure  performance and longevity.
*The bell, a flaring horn, usually made from spun 316 grade stainless steel. The bell serves as a sound [[resonator]], and its flaring shape couples the sound efficiently to the air, increasing the volume of sound radiated.
The overall length of acoustic cleaner horns range from 430&amp;nbsp;mm to over 3 metres long.  The device can operate from a pressure range of 4.8 to 6.2 bars or 70 to 90 psi. The resultant sound pressure level will  be around 200&amp;nbsp;dB.

There are generally 4 ways to control the operation of an acoustic cleaner. 
*The most common is by a simple timer.
*[[SCADA]] (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).
*PLC ([[programmable logic controller]]).
*Manually by [[Ball valve]].

An acoustic cleaner will typically sound for 10 seconds and then wait for a further 500 seconds before sounding again. This ratio for on/off is approximately proportional to the working life of the diaphragm. Provided the operating environment is between −40&amp;nbsp;C and 100&amp;nbsp;°C, a diaphragm should last between 3 and 5 years. The wave generator and the bell have a much longer life span and will often outlast the environment in which they operate.

The older bells which were made from  cast iron were susceptible to [[rust]]ing in certain environments. The new bells made from 316 spun steel have no problem with rust and are ideal for sterile environments such as found in the food industry or in pharmaceutical plants.

Acoustic cleaning began in the early 1970s with experiments using  ship horns or [[air raid siren]]s.  The first acoustic cleaners  were made from [[cast iron]]. From 1990 onwards the technology became commercially viable and began to be used in dry processing, storage, transport, power generation and manufacturing industries. The latest technology uses 316 spun stainless steel to ensure optimum performance.

==Operation and performance==
The majority of acoustic cleaners operate in the audio frequency range from 60 [[hertz]] up to 420 Hz. However a few operate in the [[infrasonic]] range, below 40 Hz, which is mostly below the human hearing range, to satisfy strict [[noise control]] requirements.
There are three scientific fields which converge in the understanding of acoustic cleaning technology.
*Sound propagation. This relates to an understanding of the nature of the sound waves, how they vary and how they will interact with the environment.
*Mathematics of the environment. [[Materials science]], surface [[friction]], [[distance]] and areas familiar to a mechanical engineer.
*[[Chemical engineering]]. The chemical properties of the powder or substance to be debonded. Especially the auto adhesive properties of the powder.
An acoustic cleaner will  create a series of very rapid and powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which are then transmitted into the solid particles of ash, [[dust]], granules or powder. This causes them to move at differing speeds and debond from adjoining particles and the surface that they are adhering to. Once they have been separated then the material will fall off due to [[gravity]] or it will be carried away by the process gas or air stream. 

The key features which determine whether or not an acoustic cleaner will be effective for any given problem are the particle size range, the [[moisture content]] and the [[density]] of the particles as well as how these characteristics will change with temperature and time.
Typically particles between 20 micrometres and 5&amp;nbsp;mm with moisture content below 8.5% are ideal. Upper temperature limits are dependent upon the melting point of the particles and acoustic cleaners have been employed at temperatures above 1000 C to remove ash build-up in boiler plants.

It is important to match the operating frequencies to the requirements. Higher frequencies can be directed more accurately whilst lower frequencies will carry further, and are generally used for more demanding requirements. A typical selection of frequencies available would be as follows:

*420 Hz for a small acoustic cleaner which might be used to clear bridging at the base of a silo.
*350 Hz will be more powerful and this frequency can be used to unblock material build-up in ID (induced draft) fans, filters, cyclones, mixers, dryers and coolers.
*230 Hz. At this frequency, the power involved is sufficient to use in most [[electricity generation]] applications.
*75 Hz and 60 Hz. These are generally the most powerful acoustic cleaners and are often used in large vessels and [[Storage silo|silo]]s.

==Health and safety==
The introduction of acoustic cleaners has been a significant improvement in many areas of [[health and safety]]. For instance in [[Storage silo|silo]] cleaning - the previous solutions tended to be intrusive or destructive. Air cannons, [[soot blower]]s, external vibrators, hammering or costly man entry are all superseded by noninvasive sonic horns.
An acoustic cleaner requires no down time and will operate during normal usage of the site.
Taking the example of silo cleaning a little further, there are two typical problems.

===Bridging===
This is when the silo blocks at the outlet. Previously the problem was addressed by manual cleaning from underneath the silo which in its turn introduced significant risk from falling material when the blockage was cleared. An acoustic cleaner is able to operate from the top of a silo through in situ material to clear the blockage at the base.

===Rat holing===
Compaction on the side of a silo. This not only reduces the operating volume in a silo but it also compromises quality control by disrupting the first in first out cycle. Older material compacted on the side of a silo can also start to degrade and produce dangerous gases. An acoustic cleaner will produce sound waves which will make the compacted material resonate at a different rate to the surrounding environment resulting in debonding and clearance.

==Advantages of acoustic cleaners==
*Repetitive use during operations means that there are fewer unscheduled shut downs.
*Improved material flow by the elimination of hang-ups, blocking and bridging.
*Minimisation of cross contamination by ensuring complete emptying of the environment.
*Improved cleaning and reduction of health and safety risks.
*Increased energy efficiency. Reducing the buildup on heat exchange surfaces results in lower energy usage.
*Extended plant life. Aggressive cleaning regimes are avoided.
*Ease of operation. It is easy to automate the horns either at regular intervals or to tie the sounding in to changes in their environment such as pressure or flow rates.
*Importantly they prevent the material buildup problem from occurring in the first place.

These advantages mean that the financial payback is often very quick.

It is also possible to compare acoustic cleaners directly to alternative solutions.

*Air cannons. These are well established but are expensive with limited coverage thus requiring multi unit purchase. They are also noise intrusive and have a high compressed air consumption.
*Vibrators. These are easy to fit to an empty silo but can cause structural damage as well as contributing to powder compaction.
*Low friction linings. These are very quiet but are expensive to install. Also they are prone to erosion and can then contaminate the environment or product.
*Inflatable pads and liners. Again these are easy to install in an empty silo. They help side wall buildup but have no impact on bridging. They are also hard to maintain and can cause compaction.
*Fluidisation through a 1 way membrane. This can help already compacted material. However they are expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging.

==Specific applications for acoustic cleaners==
*[[Boiler]]s. Cleaning of the heat transfer surfaces.
*[[Electrostatic precipitator]]s. Acoustic cleaners are being used for cleaning hoppers, turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires.
*[[Super heater]]s, economisers and air heaters.
*Duct work. 
*Filters. Acoustic cleaners are used on reverse air, pulse jet and shaker units. They are effective in reducing pressure drop across the collection surface which will increase bag life and prevent hopper pluggage. Generally they can totally replace the both reverse air fans and shaker units and significantly reduce the compressed air requirement on pulse jet filters.
*ID fans.   Acoustic cleaning helps to provide a uniform cleaning pattern even for inaccessible parts of the fan. This maintains the balance of the fan.
*[[Kiln]] inlet. Acoustic cleaners help to prevent particulate buildup at the [[kiln]] inlet and this will minimise nose ring formation.
*Mechanical pre Collectors. Acoustic cleaners help prevent buildup around the impellers and between the tubes.
*Mills. Acoustic cleaners help maintain material flow and also prevent blockages in the pre grind silos. They also help prevent material buildup in the downstream separators and fans.
*Planetary Coolers. Acoustic cleaners help prevent bridging and ensure complete evacuation.
*Precipitator. Acoustic cleaners help clean the turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires. They can either assist or replace the mechanical rapping systems. They also prevent particulate buildup in the under hoppers which would otherwise result in opacity spiking.
*Pre heaters.  Used in towers, gas risers, cyclones and fans.
*Ship cargo holds. Used both to clean and de aerate current loads.
*[[Silo cleaning|Silos and hoppers]].  To prevent bridging and rat holing.
*Static cyclones. Acoustic cleaners will work both within the cyclone and with the associated duct work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35321">'''Automatic Link Establishment''', commonly known as '''ALE''', is the worldwide [[de facto standard]] for digitally initiating and sustaining [[High frequency|HF]] radio communications.&lt;ref name="ITU2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequency Agile Systems in the MF/HF Bands |author=Telecom Bureau, ITU-D/SG|date=2000-12-14

|format=doc | publisher=International Telecommunications Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALE is a feature in an HF communications radio transceiver system that enables the radio station to make contact, or initiate a [[telecommunication circuit|circuit]], between itself and another HF radio station or network of stations. The purpose is to provide a reliable rapid method of calling and connecting during constantly changing HF ionospheric propagation, reception interference, and shared spectrum use of busy or congested HF channels.

== Mechanism ==
A standalone ALE radio combines an [[High frequency|HF]] [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] radio transceiver with an internal [[central processing unit|microprocessor]] and [[MFSK]] [[modem]]. It is programmed with a unique ALE [[logical address|address]], similar to a phone number (or on newer generations, a username). When not actively in contact with another station, the HF SSB transceiver constantly scans through a list of HF frequencies called ''channels'', listening for any ALE signals transmitted by other radio stations. It decodes calls and [[automatic sounding|soundings]] sent by other stations and uses the [[bit error rate]] to store a quality score for that frequency and sender-address.

To reach a specific station, the caller enters the ALE Address. On many ALE radios this is similar to dialing a phone number. The ALE controller selects the best available idle channel for that destination address. After confirming the channel is indeed idle, it then sends a brief [[selective calling]] signal identifying the intended recipient. When the distant scanning station detects ALE activity, it stops scanning and stays on that channel until it can confirm whether or not the call is for it. The two stations' ALE controllers automatically [[handshaking|handshake]] to confirm that a link of sufficient quality has been established, then notify the operators that the link is up. If the callee fails to respond or the handshaking fails, the originating ALE node usually selects another frequency either at random or by making a guess of varying sophistication.

Upon successful linking, the receiving station generally emits an audible alarm and shows a visual alert to the operator, thus indicating the incoming call. It also indicates the callsign or other identifying information of the linked station, similar to [[Caller ID]]. The operator then un-mutes the radio and answers the call then can talk in a regular conversation or negotiates a data link using voice or the ALE built-in short text message format. Alternatively, digital data can be exchanged via a built-in or external modem (such as a [[STANAG|STANAG 5066]] or [[MIL-STD-188#MIL-STD-188-100 series|MIL-STD-188-110B]] serial tone modem) depending on needs and availability.  The ALE built-in text messaging facility can be used to transfer short text messages as an "orderwire" to allow operators to coordinate external equipment such as phone patches or non-embedded digital links, or for short tactical messages.&lt;ref name="ARRL1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MENOLD"/&gt; &lt;!-- More appropriate references should be found, especially among the documentation written by various primary-user militaries --&gt;

== Operator skill ==
Due to the vagaries of ionospheric communications, HF radio as used by large governmental organizations in the mid-20th century was traditionally the domain of highly skilled and trained radio operators. One of the new characteristics that embedded microprocessors and computers brought to HF radio via ALE, was alleviation of the need for the radio operator to constantly monitor and change the radio frequency manually to compensate for ionospheric conditions or interference. For the average user of ALE, after learning how to work the basic functions of the HF transceiver, it became similar to operating a cellular mobile phone. For more advanced functions and programming of ALE controllers and networks, it became similar to the use of [[Menu (computing)|menu-enabled]] [[Consumer electronics|consumer equipment]] or the optional features typically encountered in [[software]]. In a professional or military organization, this does not eliminate the need for skilled and trained communicators to coordinate the per-unit authorized frequency lists and node addresses{{snd}} it merely allows the deployment of relatively unskilled technicians as "field communicators" and end-users of the existing coordinated architecture.

== Common applications ==
An ALE radio system enables connection for voice conversation, alerting, data exchange, texting, instant messaging, email, file transfer, image, [[Global Positioning System|geo-position]] tracking, or telemetry. With a radio operator initiating a call, the process normally takes a few minutes for the ALE to pick an HF frequency that is optimum for both sides of the communication link. It signals the operators audibly and visually on both ends, so they can begin communicating with each other immediately. In this respect, the longstanding need in HF radio for repetitive calling on pre-determined time schedules or tedious monitoring static is eliminated. It is useful as a tool for finding optimum channels to communicate between stations in real-time. In modern HF communications, ALE has largely replaced HF prediction charts, propagation beacons, chirp sounders, propagation prediction software, and traditional radio operator educated guesswork. ALE is most commonly used for hooking up operators for voice contacts on SSB ([[single-sideband modulation]]), HF internet connectivity for email, [[SMS]] phone texting or [[text messaging]], real-time chat via HF text, Geo Position Reporting, and file transfer. [[High Frequency Internet Protocol]] or HFIP may be used with ALE for internet access via HF.

== Techniques ==
The essence of ALE techniques is the use of automatic channel selection, scanning receivers, [[selective calling]], [[handshaking]], and robust burst modems.&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt; An ALE node decodes all received ALE signals heard on the channel(s) it monitors. It uses the fact that all ALE messages use [[forward error correction]] (FEC) redundancy. By noting how much error-correction occurred in each received and decoded message, an ALE node can detect the "quality" of the path between the sending station and itself. This information is coupled with the [[logical address|ALE address]] of the sending node and the channel the message was received on, and stored in the node's Link Quality Analysis (LQA) memory.&lt;ref name="MENOLD"/&gt; When a call is initiated, the LQA [[lookup table]] is searched for matches involving the target ALE address and the best historic channel is used to call the target station. This reduces the likelihood that the call has to be repeated on alternate frequencies. Once the target station has heard the call and responded, a bell or other signalling device will notify both operators that a link has been established. At this point, the operators may coordinate further communication via orderwire text messages, voice, or other means. If further digital communication is desired, it may take place via external data modems or via optional modems built into the ALE terminal.

This unusual usage of FEC redundancy is the primary innovation that differentiates ALE from previous [[selective calling]] systems which either decoded a call or failed to decode due to noise or interference. A binary outcome of "Good enough" or not gave no way of automatically choosing between two channels, both of which are currently good enough for minimum communications. The redundancy-based scoring inherent in ALE thus allows for selecting the "best" available channel and (in more advanced ALE nodes) using all decoded traffic over some time window to sort channels into a list of decreasing probability-to-contact, significantly reducing co-channel interference to other users as well as dramatically decreasing the time needed to successfully link with the target node.

Techniques used in the ALE standard include automatic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]], automatic station identification ([[Automatic sounding|sounding]]), [[Polling (computer science)|polling]], [[message]] [[store-and-forward]], linking protection and anti-[[Spoofing attack|spoofing]] to prevent hostile denial of service by ending the channel scanning process. Optional ALE functions include polling and the exchange of [[Return channel|orderwire]] commands and messages. The orderwire message, known as AMD (Automatic Message Display), is the most commonly used text transfer method of ALE, and the only universal method that all ALE controllers have in common for displaying text.&lt;ref name="141B"/&gt; It is common for vendors to offer extensions to AMD for various non-standard features, although dependency on these extensions undermines interoperability. As in all interoperability scenarios, care should be taken to determine if this is acceptable before using such extensions.

== History and precedents ==
ALE evolved from older HF radio [[selective calling]] technology. It combined existing channel-scanning selective calling concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers.&lt;ref name="QEX1"&gt;{{cite web | title=ALE--The Coming of Automatic Link Establishment |author1=Adair, R. |author2=Peach, D. | date=January 1990 | url=http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/pdf/9001qex003.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=ARRL, QEX, 1990-JAN, Reprint of NTIA ITS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ALE-family controller units were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.

Various methods and proprietary digital signaling protocols were used by different manufacturers in first generation ALE, leading to incompatibility.&lt;ref name="MENOLD"/&gt; Later, a cooperative effort among manufacturers and the US government resulted in a second generation of ALE that included the features of first generation systems, while improving performance. The second generation 2G ALE system standard in 1986, MIL-STD-188-141A,&lt;ref name="141B"/&gt; was adopted in FED-STD-1045&lt;ref name="1045A"&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Standard 1045A | url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1045a/ | publisher=US Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;  for US federal entities. In the 1980s, military and other entities of the US government began installing early ALE units, using ALE controller products built primarily by US companies. The primary application during the first 10 years of ALE use was government and military radio systems, and the limited customer base combined with the necessity to adhere to [[MILSPEC]] standards kept prices extremely high. Over time, demand for ALE capabilities spread and by the late 1990s, most new government HF radios purchased were designed to meet at least the minimum ALE [[interoperability]] standard, making them eligible for use with standard ALE node gear. Radios implementing at least minimum ALE node functionality as an option internal to the radio became more common and significantly more affordable.  As the standards were adopted by other governments worldwide, more manufacturers produced competitively priced HF radios to meet this demand. The need to interoperate with government organizations prompted many [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs) to at least partially adopt ALE standards for communication. As non-military experience spread and prices came down, other civilian entities started using 2G ALE. By the year 2000, there were enough civilian and government organizations worldwide using ALE that it became a de facto HF [[interoperability]] standard for situations where a priori channel and address coordination is possible.

In the late 1990s, a third generation 3G ALE with significantly improved capability and performance was included in MIL-STD-188-141B,&lt;ref name="141B"&gt;{{cite web | title=MIL-STD 188-141B
|url=http://hflink.com/standards/ALE_standard_188_141B.pdf
|format=PDF | publisher=US Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining backward compatibility with 2G ALE, and was adopted in [[NATO]] STANAG 4538. Civilian and non-government adoption rates are much lower than 2G ALE due to the extreme cost as compared to surplus or entry-level 2G gear as well as the significantly increased system and planning complexity necessary to realize the benefits inherent in the 3G specification. For many militaries, whose needs for maximized intra-organizational capability and capacity always strain existing systems, the additional cost and complexity of 3G is far more compelling.

=== Reliability ===
ALE enables rapid unscheduled communication and message passing without requiring complex message centers, multiple radios and antennas, or highly trained operators. With the removal of these potential sources of failure, the tactical communication process becomes much more robust and reliable. The effects extend beyond mere [[Force multiplication]] of existing communications methods; units such as helicopters, when outfitted with ALE radios, can now reliably communicate in situations where the crew are too busy to operate a traditional non-[[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] radio.&lt;ref name="FIEDLERHELO"&gt;{{cite web | title=Automated HF communications for nap-of-the-earth flying | author=Fiedler, D | year=1994
|url=http://www.gordon.army.mil/ocos/ac/articles/fiedler/dfale.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=United States Army }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to enable tactical communication in conditions where dedicated trained operators and hardware are inappropriate is often considered to be the true improvement offered by ALE.

ALE is a critical path toward increased [[interoperability]] between organizations. By enabling a station to participate nearly simultaneously in many different HF networks, ALE allows for convenient cross-organization message passing and monitoring without requiring dedicated separate equipment and operators for each partner organization. This dramatically reduces staffing and equipment considerations, while enabling small mobile or portable stations to participate in multiple networks and subnetworks. The result is increased resilience, decreased fragility, increased ability to communicate information effectively, and the ability to rapidly add to or replace communication points as the situation demands.

When combined with [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave]] (NVIS) techniques and sufficient channels spread across the spectrum, an ALE node can provide greater than 95% success linking on the first call, nearly on par with [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] systems. This is significantly more reliable than cellphone infrastructure during disasters or wars yet is mostly immune to such considerations itself.

== Standards and protocols ==
Global standards for ALE are based on the original US MIL-STD 188-141A&lt;ref name="141B"/&gt; and FED-1045,&lt;ref name="1045A"/&gt; known as 2nd Generation (2G) ALE. 2G ALE uses non-synchronised scanning of channels, and it takes several seconds to half a minute to repeatedly scan through an entire list of channels looking for calls. Thus it requires sufficient duration of transmission time for calls to connect or link with another station that is unsynchronised with its calling signal. The vast majority of ALE systems in use in the world at the present time are 2G ALE.

=== 2G technical characteristics ===
[[File:2g ale spectrum.jpg|thumb|290px|right|2G ALE Signal]]The more common 2G ALE signal waveform is designed to be compatible with standard 3&amp;nbsp;kHz SSB narrowband voice channel transceivers. The modulation method is 8ary Frequency Shift Keying or 8FSK, also sometimes called Multi Frequency Shift Keying [[MFSK]], with eight orthogonal tones between 750 and 2500&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="141B"/&gt; Each tone is 8 ms long, resulting in a transmitted over-the-air symbol rate of 125 baud or 125 symbols per second, with a raw data rate of 375 bits per second. The ALE data is formatted in 24-bit frames, which consist of a 3 bit preamble followed by three ASCII characters, each seven bits long. The received signal is usually decoded using [[digital signal processing]] techniques that are capable of recovering the 8FSK signal at a negative decibel signal to noise ratio (i.e., the signal may be recovered even when it is below the noise level). The over-the-air layers of the protocol involve the use of [[forward error correction]], [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]], and [[handshaking]] transponding similar to those used in [[Automatic repeat request|ARQ]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Klingenfuss"&gt;{{cite book | author=Klingenfuss, J. |title=Radio Data Code Manual |edition=17th| publisher=Klingenfuss Publications | year=2003 | isbn=3-924509-56-5 | pages=72–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3G technical characteristics ===
Newer standards of ALE called 3rd Generation or 3G ALE, use accurate time synchronization (via a defined time-synch protocol as well as the option of [[GPS]]-locked clocks) to achieve faster and more dependable linking. Through synchronization, the calling time to achieve a link may be reduced to less than 10 seconds. The 3G ALE modem signal also provides better [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]] and can work in channel conditions that are less favorable than 2G ALE.&lt;ref name="JOHNSON"&gt;{{cite web | title=Simulation Results for Third-Generation HF Automatic Link Establishment | author=Johnson, E. | date=2008-08-17
|url=http://wireless.nmsu.edu/hf/papers/milcom99.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=New Mexico State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwell groups, limited callsigns, and shorter burst transmissions enable more rapid intervals of scanning. All stations in the same group scan and receive each channel at precisely the same time window. Although 3G ALE is more reliable and has significantly enhanced channel-time efficiency, the existence of a large [[installed base]] of 2G ALE radio systems and the wide availability of moderately priced (often military surplus) equipment, has made 2G the baseline standard for global interoperability.

== Basis for HF interoperability communications ==
[[Interoperability]] is a critical issue for the disparate entities which use radiocommunications to fulfill the needs of organizations. Largely due to the ubiquity of 2G ALE, it became the primary method for providing interoperability on HF between governmental and [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] disaster relief and emergency communications entities, and amateur radio volunteers. With digital techniques increasingly employed in communications equipment, a universal digital calling standard was needed, and ALE filled the gap. Nearly every major HF radio manufacturer in the world builds ALE radios to the 2G standard to meet the high demand that new installations of HF radio systems conform to this standard protocol. Disparate entities that historically used incompatible radio methods were then able to call and converse with each other using the common 2G ALE [[Computing platform|platform]]. Some manufacturers and organizations&lt;ref name="GAREC"/&gt;  have used the AMD feature of ALE to expand the performance and connectivity.&lt;ref name="CALM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Codan Automatic Link Management CALM
|url=http://hf-ssb-transceiver.at-communication.com/en/codan/hf_ssb_transceiver_ngt.html
|format=PDF | publisher=Codan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, this has been successful, and in other cases, the use of proprietary preamble or embedded commands has led to interoperability problems.

=== Tactical communication and resource management ===
ALE serves as a convenient method of beyond line of sight communication. Originally developed to support military requirements, ALE is useful to many organizations who find themselves managing widely located units. [[United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and [[United States Coast Guard]] are two members of the [[Customs Over the Horizon Enforcement Network]] (COTHEN), a MIL-STD 188-141A ALE network.&lt;ref name="COTHEN_RR"&gt;{{cite web | title= COTHEN - The RadioReference Wiki | url=http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/COTHEN }}&lt;/ref&gt; All U.S. armed forces operate multiple similar networks. Similarly, shortwave utility listeners have documented frequency and callsign lists for many nations' military and guard units, as well as networks operated by oil exploration and production companies and public utilities in many countries.

=== Emergency / disaster relief or extraordinary situation response communications ===
ALE radio communication systems for both HF regional area networks and HF interoperability communications are in service among emergency and disaster relief agencies as well as military and guard forces. Extraordinary response agencies and organizations use ALE to respond to situations in the world where conventional communications may have been temporarily overloaded or damaged. In many cases, it is in place as alternative back-channel for organizations that may have to respond to situations or scenarios involving the loss of conventional communications. Earthquakes, storms, volcanic eruptions, and power or communication infrastructure failures are typical situations in which organizations may deem ALE necessary to operations. ALE networks are common among organizations engaged in extraordinary situation response such as: natural and man-made disasters, transportation, power, or telecommunication network failures, war, peacekeeping, or stability operations. Organizations known to use ALE for [[Emergency management]], disaster relief, ordinary communication or extraordinary situation response include: [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]], [[Disaster Medical Assistance Team]]s, [[NATO]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United Nations]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Civil Air Patrol]], [https://www.dhs.gov/shares SHARES], State of [[California]] [http://www.calema.ca.gov Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA)], other US States' Offices of Emergency Services or Emergency Management Agencies, and [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service]] (ARES).&lt;ref name="GAREC"/&gt;

=== International HF telecommunications for disaster relief ===
The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), in response to the need for interoperation in international disaster response spurred largely by humanitarian relief, included ALE in its [[Telecommunications for Disaster Relief]] recommendations.&lt;ref name="ITU"&gt;{{cite web | title=ITU ALE Handbook
|url=http://hflink.com/itu/ITU_ALE_Handbook.pdf
|format=PDF | publisher=International Telecommunications Union ITU }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing need for instant connectivity for logistical and tactical disaster relief response communications, such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] [[tsunami]] led to ITU actions of encouragement to countries around the world toward loosening restrictions on such communications and equipment border transit during catastrophic disasters. The IARU [[Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conference]]s (GAREC) and IARU Global Simulated Emergency Tests have included ALE.&lt;ref name="IARU"&gt;{{cite web | title=ALE for Emergency Disaster Relief Communications | author=IARU | date=2007-08-17
|url=http://hflink.com/garec/ALE_IARU_GlobalEmCommConference2007.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=International Amateur Radio Union IARU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in amateur radio ==
[[Amateur radio]] operators began sporadic ALE operation on a limited basis in the early to mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="MENOLD"&gt;{{cite web | title=ALE--The Coming of Automatic Link Establishment | author=Menold, Ronald E., AD4TB | date=February 1995
|url=http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/pdf/9502068.pdf
|format=PDF | publisher=ARRL, QST Volume 79, Number 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with commercial ALE radios and ALE controllers. In 2000, the first widely available software ALE controller for the Personal Computer, ''PCALE'', became available, and hams started to set up stations based on it. In 2001, the first organized and coordinated global ALE nets for International Amateur Radio began. In August 2005, ham radio operators supporting communications for emergency [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] shelters used ALE for Disaster Relief operations during the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster.&lt;ref name="GAREC"&gt;{{cite web | title=ALE for Emergency / Disaster Relief Communications |author1=Crystal, B. |author2=Barrow, A. | date=2007-08-17
|url=http://www.hflink.com/garec/garec2007/index_files/v3_document.htm | publisher=International Amateur Radio Union IARU }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the event, hams developed more permanent ALE emergency/disaster relief networks, including internet connectivity, with a focus on interoperation between organizations. The amateur radio [http://hflink.com HFLink Automatic Link Establishment] system uses an open net protocol to enable all amateur radio operators and amateur radio nets worldwide to participate in ALE and share the same ALE channels legally and interoperably. Amateur radio operators may use it to call each other for voice or data communications.&lt;ref name="ARRL1"&gt;{{cite web | title=ARRL We Do That: What Is ALE? | author=Crystal, B. | date=2008-03-31
|url=http://wedothatradio.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/23/ | publisher=ARRL, National Association for Amateur Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amateur radio interoperability adaptations ===
Amateur radio operators commonly provide local, regional, national, and international emergency / disaster relief communications.&lt;ref name="IARU"/&gt; The need for interoperability on HF led to the adoption of [http://hflink.com Automatic Link Establishment ALE] open networks by hams. Amateur radio adapted 2G ALE techniques, by using the common denominators of the 2G ALE protocol, with a limited subset of features found in the majority of all ALE radios and controllers. Each amateur radio ALE station uses the operator's [[call sign]] as the [[logical address|address]], also known as the ALE Address, in the ALE radio controller.&lt;ref name="ARRL1"/&gt; The [[lowest common denominator]] technique enables any manufacturer's ALE radios or software to be used for HF interoperability communications and networking. Known as Ham-Friendly ALE, the amateur radio ALE standard is used to establish [[Two-way radio|radio]] communications, through a combination of active ALE on internationally recognized automatic data frequencies, and passive ALE scanning on voice channels. In this technique, active ALE frequencies include [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] periodic polite station identification, while passive ALE frequencies are silently scanned for selective calling. ALE systems include Listen Before Transmit as a standard function, and in most cases this feature provides better busy channel detection of voice and data signals than the human ear. Ham-Friendly ALE technique is also known as 2.5G ALE, because it maintains 2G ALE compatibility while employing some of the adaptive channel management features of 3G ALE, but without the accurate [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] time synchronization of 3G ALE.

=== Disaster relief HF network ===
[[Hot standby]] nets are in constant operation [[24/7/365]] for International Emergency and [[Disaster Relief]] communications. The [http://hflink.com/hfn/ Ham Radio Global ALE High Frequency Network], which began service in June 2007, is the world's largest intentionally open ALE [[Telecommunication network|network]] for internet connectivity. It is a free open network staffed by volunteers, and used by amateur radio operators supporting disaster relief organizations.&lt;ref name="IARU"/&gt;

=== International coordination ===
International amateur radio ALE [[High Frequency]] channels are frequency coordinated with all Regions of the [http://www.iaru.org/ International Amateur Radio Union] (IARU entity of ITU),&lt;ref name="GAREC"/&gt; for international, regional, national, and local use in the Amateur Radio Service. All Amateur Radio ALE channels use "USB" Upper [[Sideband]] standard. Different rules, regulations, and bandplans of the region and local country of operation apply to use of various channels. Some channels may not be available in every country. Primary or global channels are in common with most countries and regions.&lt;ref name="ARRL2"&gt;{{cite web | title=ARRL Technical Information Service page:ARRLWeb: ALE (Automatic Link Establishment) | author=ARRL | date=2005-08-01

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar [[cloning vector]] called a [[p1-derived artificial chromosome|PAC]] has also been produced from the DNA of P1 bacteriophage.

BACs are often used to [[sequencing|sequence]] the genome of organisms in [[genome project]]s, for example the [[Human Genome Project]]. A short piece of the organism's [[DNA]] is amplified as an insert in BACs, and then sequenced. Finally, the sequenced parts are rearranged ''[[in silico]]'', resulting in the genomic sequence of the organism. BACs were replaced with faster and less laborious sequencing methods like whole genome [[shotgun sequencing]] and now more recently [[Next-generation sequencing|next-gen sequencing]].

==Common gene components==
;''repE'': for plasmid replication and regulation of copy number.
;''[[parABS system|parA]] and [[parABS system|parB]]'': for partitioning F plasmid DNA to daughter cells during division and ensures stable maintenance of the BAC.
;A [[selectable marker]]: for [[antibiotic resistance]]; some BACs also have [[lacZ]] at the cloning site for [[Blue white screen|blue/white selection]].
;''T7 &amp; Sp6'': [[Promoter (genetics)|phage promoters]] for transcription of inserted genes.

==Contribution to models of disease==

===Inherited disease===
BACs are now being utilized to a greater extent in [[modelling genetic diseases]], often alongside [[transgenic]] mice. BACs have been useful in this field as complex genes may have several regulatory sequences upstream of the encoding sequence, including various [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences that will govern a gene's expression level. BACs have been used to some degree of success with mice when studying neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or as in the case of [[aneuploidy]] associated with Down syndrome. There have also been instances when they have been used to study specific [[oncogene]]s associated with cancers. They are transferred over to these genetic disease models by electroporation/transformation, transfection with a suitable virus or microinjection. BACs can also be utilized to detect genes or large sequences of interest and then used to map them onto the human chromosome using BAC [[DNA microarray|arrays]]. BACs are preferred for these kind of genetic studies because they accommodate much larger sequences without the risk of rearrangement, and are therefore more stable than other types of cloning vectors.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Infectious disease===
The genomes of several large [[DNA viruses]] and [[RNA viruses]] have been cloned as BACs. These constructs are referred to as "infectious clones", as transfection of the BAC construct into host cells is sufficient to initiate viral infection. The infectious property of these BACs has made the study of many viruses such as the [[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]], [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] and [[Coronaviridae|coronaviruses]] more accessible.&lt;ref name="Almazan2000"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3192">'''Biodrying''' is the process by which [[biodegradable waste]] is rapidly heated through initial stages of [[composting]] to remove moisture from a [[waste stream]] and hence reduce its overall weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi HL, Richard TL, Ahn HK |title=Composting high moisture materials: biodrying poultry manure in a sequentially fed reactor |journal=Compost Sci. and Util. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=303–11 |year=2001 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/CSUContents/2001/Autumn/303.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930122054/http://www.biocycle.net/CSUContents/2001/Autumn/303.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navaee-Ardeh S, Bertrand F, Stuart PR |title=Emerging biodrying technology for the drying of pulp and paper mixed sludges |journal=Drying Technology |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=863–78 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a748750739?words=biodrying}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugni M, Calcaterra E, Adani F |title=Biostabilization-biodrying of municipal solid waste by inverting air-flow |journal=Bioresour.

Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for [[refuse-derived fuel]]s. 
Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce [[landfill gas]] and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils [[Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme|LATS]] allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial [[mechanical biological treatment]] (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velis CA, Longhurst PJ, Drew GH, Smith R, Pollard SJ |title=Biodrying for mechanical-biological treatment of wastes: a review of process science and engineering |journal=Bioresour.

== History ==

Biopython development began in 1999 and it was first released in July 2000.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=The Biopython Project: Philosophy, functionality and facts |url=http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/presentations/biopython_exelixis.pdf |date=11 March 2004 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed during a similar time frame and with analogous goals to other projects that added bioinformatics capabilities to their respective programming languages, including [[BioPerl]], [[BioRuby]] and [[BioJava]]. Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date.&lt;ref name="Contributors"&gt;{{Citation |title=List of Biopython contributors |url=http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140911121354/http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a similar [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, namely '''PyCogent''', was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see [[#Key features and examples|Key features and examples]]).

As of version 1.62, Biopython supports running on Python 3 as well as Python 2.&lt;ref name="Installation"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=Biopython Installation |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; objects can be manipulated via [[Array slicing#1991: Python|slicing]], in a manner similar to Python’s strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"/&gt;

Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.&lt;ref name="lists"/&gt;

== Key features and examples ==

=== Sequences ===
A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;ref name="Tutorial"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chang |first=Jeff |last2=Chapman |first2=Brad |last3=Friedberg |first3=Iddo |last4=Hamelryck |first4=Thomas |last5=de Hoon |first5=Michiel |last6=Cock |first6=Peter |last7=Antao |first7=Tiago |last8=Talevich |first8=Eric |last9=Wilczynski |first9=Bartek  |title=Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Biopython &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence = Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence
Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence[2:7]
Seq('GCTTC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence.reverse_complement()
Seq('TACGAGAAGCCT', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence
Seq('AGGCUUCUCGUA', IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence.translate()
Seq('RLLV', IUPACProtein())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Sequence annotation ===
The &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Each &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‘gene’, ‘CDS’ (coding sequence), ‘repeat_region’, ‘mobile_element’ or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record = SeqIO.read('pTC2.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.name

=== Input and output ===
Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including [[FASTA format|FASTA]], [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]], GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and [[Nexus file|NEXUS]].  When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows records of one file format to be converted into others.

Very large sequence files can exceed a computer's memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files.  They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or [[Associative array|dictionaries]], providing fast access at the cost of memory usage.  Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes = SeqIO.parse('salmonella.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for genome in genomes:
...     SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + '.fasta', 'fasta')
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Accessing online databases ===

Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases.  Each of the functions provided by the [[Entrez]] search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Entrez
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_file = open('all_records.fasta', "w")
&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrez.email = 'my_email@example.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; records_to_download = ['FO834906.1', 'FO203501.1']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for record_id in records_to_download:
...     handle = Entrez.efetch(db='nucleotide', id=record_id, rettype='gb')
...     seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format='gb')
...     handle.close()
...     output_file.write(seqRecord.format('fasta'))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Phylogeny ===

[[File:Phylo.draw.png|thumb|300px|Figure 1: A rooted phylogenetic tree created by Bio.Phylo showing the relationship between different organisms' Apaf-1 homologs&lt;ref name="Zmasek2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zmasek |first=Christian M |last2=Zhang |first2=Qing |last3=Ye |first3=Yuzhen |last4=Godzik |first4=Adam |date=24 October 2007 |title=Surprising complexity of the ancestral apoptosis network |url=http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R226 |journal=Genome Biology |publisher= |volume=8 |issue=10 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r226 |pages=R226 |pmid=17958905 |pmc=2246300}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Phylo.draw graphviz.png|thumb|Figure 2: The same tree as above, drawn unrooted using Graphviz via Bio.Phylo]]

The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising [[phylogenetic tree]]s.  A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including [[Newick format|Newick]], [[Nexus file|NEXUS]] and [[phyloXML]].  Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Clade&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree's root, and analysing branch features such as length or score.&lt;ref name="Talevich2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talevich |first=Eric |last2=Invergo |first2=Brandon M |last3=Cock |first3=Peter JA |last4=Chapman |first4=Brad A |date=21 August 2012 |title=Bio.Phylo: A unified toolkit for processing, analyzing and visualizing phylogenetic trees in Biopython |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/209 |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=209 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-209 |pmid=22909249 |pmc=3468381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted trees can be drawn in [[ASCII art|ASCII]] or using [[matplotlib]] (see Figure 1), and the [[Graphviz]] library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).

=== Genome diagrams ===

[[File:PKPS77.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: A diagram of the genes on the pKPS77 plasmid,&lt;ref name="NC_023330.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023330.1 |title=Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPS77 plasmid pKPS77, complete sequence |date= |website= |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; visualised using the GenomeDiagram module in Biopython]]

The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython.&lt;ref name="Pritchard2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pritchard |first=Leighton |last2=White |first2=Jennifer A |last3=Birch |first3=Paul RJ |last4=Toth |first4=Ian K |title=GenomeDiagram: a python package for the visualization of large-scale genomic data |journal=Bioinformatics |date=March 2006 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=616–617 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btk021 |pmid=16377612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]].  Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks.  By looping over a sequence's features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram's tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram.  Cross-links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.

=== Macromolecular structure ===

The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB]] and [[Crystallographic Information File|mmCIF]] files, and was added to Biopython in 2003.&lt;ref name="Hamelryck2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamelryck |first=Thomas |last2=Manderick |first2=Bernard |date=10 May 2003 |title=PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/17/2308 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=17 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg299 |pages=2308–2310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; objects contain &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Chain&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Residue&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Atom&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, &lt;code&gt;DisorderedResidue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DisorderedAtom&lt;/code&gt;, that describe their uncertain positions.

Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein.  Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.

=== Population genetics ===

The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics.&lt;ref name="Rousset2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rousset |first=François |date=January 2008 |title=GENEPOP'007: a complete re-implementation of the GENEPOP software for Windows and Linux |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |publisher= |volume=8 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for analyses of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium]], [[linkage disequilibrium]] and other features of a population's [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]].

This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using [[coalescent theory]] with the fastsimcoal2 program.&lt;ref name="Excoffier2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Excoffier |first=Laurent |last2=Foll |first2=Matthieu |date=1 March 2011 |title=fastsimcoal: a continuous-time coalescent simulator of genomic diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/9/1332 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=9 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr124 |pages=1332–1334 |pmid=21398675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wrappers for command line tools ===

Many of Biopython's modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython.  These wrappers include [[BLAST]], [[Clustal]], PhyML, [[EMBOSS]] and [[SAMtools]].  Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

'''Business analysis''' is a research [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen B Hass, Richard Vander Horst, Kimi Ziemski (2008). ''From Analyst to Leader: Elevating the Role of the Business Analyst'' Management Concepts, 2008. {{ISBN|1-56726-213-9}}. p94: "As the discipline of business analysis becomes professionalized"&lt;/ref&gt; of identifying [[business needs]] and determining solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a software-systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement, organizational change or strategic planning and policy development. The person who carries out this task is called a [[business analyst]] or BA.&lt;ref&gt;

Business analysts do not work solely on developing software systems. Those who attempt to do so run the risk of developing an incomplete solution.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/business-analysis2.pdf Alternaltive definition of Business Analysis] from [[British Computer Society|BCS]] [[ISEB]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organization, there does seem to be an area of common ground where most
[[business analyst]]s work. The responsibilities appear to be:

* To investigate business systems, taking a holistic view of the situation. This may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems.
* To evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system. Again, this may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and IT system development.
* To document the business requirements for the IT system support using appropriate documentation standards.

In line with this, the core business analyst role could be defined as an internal consultancy role that has the responsibility for investigating business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, defining requirements and ensuring the effective use of information systems in meeting the needs of the business.

==Sub-disciplines==
Business analysis as a discipline includes [[requirements analysis]], sometimes also called requirements engineering. It focuses on ensuring the changes made to an organisation are aligned with its strategic goals. These changes include changes to strategies, structures, policies, business rules, processes, and information systems.

Examples of business analysis include:

===Enterprise analysis or company analysis===
Focuses on understanding the needs of the business as a whole, its strategic direction, and identifying initiatives that will allow a business to meet those strategic goals. It also includes:

* Creating and maintaining the [[business architecture]]
* Conducting [[Feasibility study|feasibility studies]]
* Identifying new [[Business opportunity|business opportunities]]
* Scoping and defining new business opportunities
* Preparing the [[business case]]
* Conducting the initial [[risk assessment]]

===Requirements planning and management===
Involves planning the requirements development process, determining which requirements are the highest priority for implementation, and managing change.

===Requirements elicitation===
Describes techniques for collecting requirements from [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in a project. Techniques for requirements elicitation include:

* [[Brainstorming]]
* [[Content analysis|Document analysis]]
* [[Focus group]]
* [[User interface|Interface]] analysis
* [[Interviews/Questionnaire]] 
* [[Workshops]]
* [[Reverse engineering]]
* [[Statistical survey|Surveys]]
* User [[task analysis]]
* [[Business process mapping|Process mapping]]
* Observation/[[job shadowing]]
* [[Design thinking]]

===Requirements analysis and documentation===
Describes how to develop and specify requirements in enough detail to allow them to be successfully implemented by a project team.

====Analysis====
The major forms of analysis are:

* [[Architecture analysis and design language|Architecture analysis]]
* [[Business process]] analysis
* [[Object-oriented analysis and design|Object-oriented analysis]]
* [[Structured analysis]]
* [[Data warehouse]] analysis, storage and databases analysis

====Documentation====
Requirements documentation can take several forms:

* Textual – for example, stories that summarize specific information
* [[Traceability matrix|Matrix]] – for example, a table of requirements with priorities
* [[Use case diagram|Diagrams]] – for example, how data flows from one structure to the other
* [[Website wireframe|Wireframe]] – for example, how elements are required in a website,
* Models – for example, [[Wire-frame model|3-D models]] that describes a character in a computer game

===Requirements communication===
Describes techniques for ensuring that stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements and how they will be implemented.

===Solution assessment and validation===
Describes how the business analyst can perform correctness of a proposed solution, how to support the implementation of a solution, and how to assess possible shortcomings in the implementation.

==Techniques==
There are a number of generic business techniques that a business analyst will use when facilitating business change.

Some of these techniques include:

===PESTLE===
{{main|PESTLE}}
This is used to  perform an external [[environmental analysis]] by examining the many different external factors affecting an organization.

The six attributes of [[PESTLE]]:
:Political (current and potential influences from political pressures)
:[[Economic]] (the local, national and world economy impact)
:[[Sociological]] (the ways in which a society can affect an organization)
:[[Technological]] (the effect of new and emerging technology)
:Legal (the effect of national and world legislation)
:Environmental (the local, national and world environmental issues)

===Heptalysis===
This is used to perform an in-depth analysis of early stage businesses/ventures on seven important categories:&lt;ref&gt;

:[[Market opportunity]]
:[[Product breakdown structure|Product]]/solution
:[[Execution plan]]
:Financial engine
:[[Human capital]]
:Potential return
:Margin of safety

===STEER===
It is an analysis that puts into consideration – the following
: Socio-cultural
: Technological
: Economic
: Ecological
: Regulatory Factors

===MOST===
This is used to perform an internal environmental analysis by defining the attributes of MOST to ensure that the project you are working on is aligned to each of the four attributes.

The four attributes of MOST are:&lt;ref&gt;

:
:[[Mission statement|Mission]] (where the business intends to go)
:[[Goal|Objectives]] (the key goals which will help achieve the mission)
:[[Strategies]] (options for moving forward)
:[[Tactic (method)|Tactic]]s (how strategies are put into action)

===SWOT===
SWOT is used to help focus activities into areas of strength and where the greatest opportunities lie. This is used to identify the dangers that take the form of weaknesses and both internal and external threats.

The four attributes of [[SWOT analysis]] are:
:[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Strengths]] – What are the advantages? What is currently done well? (e.g. key area of best-performing activities of your [[company]])
:Weaknesses – What should be improved? What is there to overcome? (e.g. key area where you are performing unsatisfactorily)
:Opportunities – What good opportunities face the [[organization]]? (e.g. key area where your competitors are performing poorly)
:[[Threats]] – What obstacles does the organization face? (e.g. key area where your competitor will perform well)

===CATWOE===
This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business perspectives help the business analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved.

There are six elements of CATWOE:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Customers – Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them?
:Actors – Who is involved in the situation, who will be involved in implementing solutions and what will impact their success?
:Transformation Process – What processes or systems are affected by the issue?
:World View – What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue?
:Owner – Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution?
:Environmental Constraints – What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success?

===de Bono's Six Thinking Hats===
This is often used in a [[brainstorming]] session to generate and analyse [[ideas]] and options. It is useful to encourage specific types of thinking and can be a convenient and symbolic way to request someone to "switch gears". It involves restricting the group to only thinking in specific ways – giving ideas &amp; analysis in the "mood" of the time. Also known as the [[Six Thinking Hats]].
:White: Pure facts, logical.
:Green: Creative.
:Yellow: Bright, optimistic, positive. 
:Black: Negative, devil’s advocate. 
:Red: Emotional. 
:Blue: Cold, control.
Not all colors / moods have to be used.

===Five Whys===
[[5 Whys|Five Whys]] is used to get to the root of what is really happening in a single instance. For each answer given a further 'why' is asked.

===MoSCoW===
This is used to prioritize requirements by allocating an appropriate priority, gauging it against the validity of the requirement itself and its priority against other requirements.

[[MoSCoW]] comprises:
:Must have – or else delivery will be a failure
:Should have – otherwise will have to adopt a workaround
:Could have – to increase delivery satisfaction
:Won't have this time – useful to the exclude requirements from this delivery timeframe

===VPEC-T===
{{main|VPEC-T}}

This technique is used when analyzing the expectations of multiple parties having different views of a system in which they all have an interest in common, but have different priorities and different responsibilities.
:Values – constitute the objectives, beliefs and concerns of all parties participating. They may be financial, social, tangible and intangible
:Policies – constraints that govern what may be done and the manner in which it may be done
:Events – real-world proceedings that stimulate activity
:Content – the meaningful portion of the documents, conversations, messages, etc. that are produced and used by all aspects of business activity
:Trust – between users of the system and their right to access and change information within it

===SCRS===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the analysis should flow from the high-level business strategy to the solution, through the current state and the requirements. SCRS stands for:

:Strategy
:Current State
:Requirements
:Solution

===Business Analysis Canvas===
The Business Analysis Canvas is a tool that enables Business Analyst to quickly present a high level view of the activities that will be completed as part of the business analysis work allocation. The Business Analysis Canvas is broken into several sections. 
: Project Objective
: Stakeholder
: Deliverable
: Impact to Target Operating Model
: Communication Approach
: Responsibilities
: Scheduling
: Key Dates

The Canvas has activities and questions the Business analyst can ask the organization to help build out the content. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.batimes.com/articles/business-analysis-canvas-roadmap-to-effective-ba-excellence.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of business analysts==
As the scope of business analysis is very wide, there has been a tendency for business analysts to specialize in one of the three sets of activities which constitute the scope of business analysis, the primary role for business analysts is to identify business needs and provide solutions to business problems these are done as being a part of following set of activities.

; Strategist
: Organizations need to focus on strategic matters on a more or less continuous basis in the modern business world. Business analysts, serving this need, are well-versed in analyzing the strategic profile of the organization and its environment, advising [[senior management]] on suitable [[policy|policies]], and the effects of policy decisions.

; Architect
: Organizations may need to introduce change to solve business problems which may have been identified by the strategic analysis, referred to above. Business analysts contribute by analyzing objectives, processes and resources, and suggesting ways by which re-design ([[Business process reengineering|BPR]]), or improvements (BPI) could be made. Particular skills of this type of analyst are "soft skills", such as knowledge of the business, [[requirements engineering]], [[stakeholder analysis]], and some "hard skills", such as [[business process modeling]]. Although the role requires an awareness of technology and its uses, it is not an [[Information Technology|IT]]-focused role.

: Three elements are essential to this aspect of the business analysis effort: the redesign of core business processes; the application of enabling technologies to support the new core processes; and the management of [[organizational change]]. This aspect of business analysis is also called "business process improvement" (BPI), or "[[Business process reengineering|reengineering]]".

; IT-systems analyst
: There is the need to align IT development with the business system as a whole. A long-standing problem in business is how to get the best [[return on investment|return]] from IT [[investment]]s, which are generally very expensive and of critical, often strategic, importance. IT departments, aware of the problem, often create a business analyst role to better understand and define the requirements for their IT systems. Although there may be some overlap with the developer and testing roles, the focus is always on the IT part of the [[change management (people)|change process]], and generally this type of business analyst gets involved only when a case for change has already been made and decided upon.

In any case, the term "analyst" is lately considered somewhat misleading, insofar as analysts (i.e. problem investigators) also do design work (solution definers).

The key responsibility areas of a business analyst are to collate the client's software requirements, understand them, and analyze them further from a business perspective. A business analyst is required to collaborate with and assist the business and assist them.&lt;ref&gt;http://businessanalystmentor.com/2009/06/29/why-should-you-become-a-business-analyst/
http://news.dice.com/2013/06/13/5-steps-to-becoming-a-business-analyst/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function within the organizational structure==
The role of business analysis can exist in a variety of structures within an organizational framework.  Because business analysts typically act as a liaison between the business and technology functions of a company, the role can be often successful either aligned to a line of business, within IT, or sometimes both.&lt;ref&gt;IRM, https://irm.com.au/ba-training-roadmap/&lt;/ref&gt;

; Business alignment
: When business analysts work at the business side, they are often subject matter experts for a specific line of business. These business analysts typically work solely on project work for a particular business, pulling in business analysts from other areas for cross-functional projects.  In this case, there are usually business systems analysts on the IT side to focus on more technical requirements.

; IT alignment
: In many cases, business analysts work solely within IT and they focus on both business and systems requirements for a project, consulting with various subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure thorough understanding.  Depending on the [[organizational structure]], business analysts may be aligned to a specific development lab or they might be grouped together in a resource pool and allocated to various projects based on availability and expertise.  The former builds specific subject matter expertise while the latter provides the ability to acquire cross-functional knowledge.

; Practice management
: In a large organizations, there are centers of excellence or practice management groups who define frameworks and monitor the standards throughout the process of implementing the change in order to maintain the quality of change and reduce the risk of changes to organization. Some organizations may have independent centers of excellence for individual streams such as project management, business analysis or quality assurance. 

A practice management team provides a framework by which all business analysts in an organization conduct their work, usually consisting of processes, [[Procedure (business)|procedures]], templates and best practices. In addition to providing guidelines and deliverables, it also provides a forum to focus on continuous improvement of the business analysis function.

==Goals==
Ultimately, business analysis wants to achieve the following outcomes:
* Create solutions
* Give enough tools for robust project management
* Improve efficiency and reduce waste
* Provide essential documentation, such as [[project initiation document]]s

One way to assess these goals is to measure the [[return on investment]] (ROI) for all projects. According to [[Forrester Research]], more than $100 billion is spent annually in the U.S. on custom and internally developed software projects.  For all of these software development projects, keeping accurate data is important and business leaders are constantly asking for the return or ROI on a proposed project or at the conclusion of an active project. However, asking for the ROI without sufficient data of where value is created or destroyed may result in inaccurate projections.

===Reduce waste and complete projects on time===
{{see also|Project cancellation}}
Project delays are costly in several ways:

* Project costs – For every month of delay, the project team costs and expenses continue to accumulate. When a large part of the development team has been outsourced, the costs will start to add up quickly and are very visible if contracted on a time and materials basis (T&amp;M). Fixed price contracts with external parties limit this risk.  For internal resources, the costs of delays are not as readily apparent, unless time spent by resources is being tracked against the project, as labor costs are essentially ‘fixed’ costs.
* Opportunity costs – Opportunity costs come in two types – lost revenue and unrealized expense reductions. Some projects are specifically undertaken with the purpose of driving new or additional revenues to the bottom line.  For every month of delay, a company foregoes a month of this new revenue stream.  The purpose of other projects is to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.  Again, each month of failure postpones the realization of these expense reductions by another month.  In the vast majority of cases, these opportunities are never captured or analyzed, resulting in misleading ROI calculations.  Of the two opportunity costs, the lost revenue is the most egregious – and the effects are greater and longer lasting.

On a lot of projects (particularly larger ones) the project manager is the one responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time. The BA's job is more to ensure that if a project is not completed on time then at least the highest priority requirements are met.

===Document the right requirements===
Business analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs. Essentially, they want to define the right application.  This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to ‘customer’ feedback,  and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program.  If a [[business analyst]] has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written – resulting in rework as discussed below.  The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the [[development cycle]].  Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused.  Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or "Keep it Simple" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of the implemented solution.

===Improve project efficiency===
Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and by shortening project length.

Rework is a common industry headache and it has become so common at many organizations that it is often built into project budgets and time lines. It generally refers to extra work needed in a project to fix errors due to incomplete or missing requirements and can impact the entire software development process from definition to coding and testing. The need for rework can be reduced by ensuring that the requirements gathering and definition processes are thorough and by ensuring that the business and technical members of a project are involved in these processes from an early stage.

Shortening project length presents two potential benefits. For every month that a project can be shortened, project resource costs can be diverted to other projects. This can lead to savings on the current project and lead to earlier start times of future projects (thus increasing revenue potential).

A '''church treasure''' ({{lang-de|Kirchenschatz}}) is the collection of historical art treasures belonging to a [[church (building)|church]], usually a [[monastery]] ('''monastery treasure'''), [[abbey]], [[cathedral]]. Such "treasure" is usually held and displayed in the church's [[treasure chamber|treasury]] or in a [[diocesan museum]]. Historically the highlight of church treasures was often a collection of [[reliquaries]].

As a result of gifts and the desire to acquire sacred artifacts, many churches over the centuries gathered valuable and historic collections of [[altar plate]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s of liturgical or religious books, as well as [[vestments]], and other works of art or items of historical interest. Despite [[iconoclasm]], [[secularism]], looting, fire, the enforced sale of treasure in times of financial difficulty, theft and other losses, much of this treasure has survived or has even been repurchased.  Many large churches have been displaying their riches to visitors in some form for centuries.

A '''circulating water plant''' or '''circulating water system''' is an arrangement of flow of water in [[fossil-fuel power station]], [[chemical plant]]s and in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]. The system is required because various [[List of industrial processes|industrial process plants]] uses [[heat exchanger]], and also for [[active fire protection]] measures. In chemical plants, for example in [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] production, water is needed in bulk quantity for preparation of [[brine]]. The circulating water system in any plant consists of a [[circulator pump]], which develops an appropriate [[hydraulic head]], and [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipelines]] to circulate the water in the entire plant.

==System description==

===Circulating water pumps===
{{See also|Circulator pump}}
Circulating water systems are normally of the wet pit type, but for sea water circulation, both the wet pit type and the concrete volute type are employed.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System)&lt;/ref&gt; In some industries, one or two stand-by pumps are also connected parallel to CW pumps. It is recommended that these pumps must be constantly driven by constant speed squirrel cage induction motors. CW pumps are designed as per IS:9137,&lt;ref&gt;IS 9137 (1978): Code for acceptance test for centrifugal,mixed flow and axial pumps - Class C [MED 20: Mechanical Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S08/is.9137.1978.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; standards of the Hydraulic Institute, USA or equivalent.

===Cooling tower===
{{See also|Cooling tower}}
In the present era, mechanical induced draft–type cooling towers are employed in cooling of water. Performance testing of cooling towers (both IDCT and NDCT) shall be carried
out as per ATC-105&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power
Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System) Pg 6-6 Section 6.4.3&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the atmospheric conditions are within the permissible limits of deviation from the design conditions. As guidelines of [[Central Electricity Authority]], two mechanical draft cooling towers Or one natural draft cooling tower must be established for each 500 MW unit in power plants. The cooling towers are designed as per Cooling Tower Institute codes.

===CW treatment system===
Some coastal power stations or chemical plants intake water from sea for condenser cooling. They either use closed cycle cooling by using cooling towers or once through cooling. Selection of type of system is based on the thermal pollution effect on sea water and techno-economics based on the distance of power station from the coast and cost of pumping sea water. Due to high salt concentration, it is necessary for circulating water make up.

==Mechanical description of CW plants ==
Source:&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System) ANNEXURE 6A pG 6-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* Five (5) numbers (4 working + 1 standby) circulating water pumps of vertical wet pit type, mixed flow design and self water lubricated complete along with motors and associated accessories.
* Electro-hydraulically operated butterfly valve (with actuators), isolating butterfly valve and rubber expansion joints at discharge of each pump. Electrically operated butterfly valves for interconnection of standby pumps to operate as common standby for both the units.
* One number CW re-circulation line for each unit, suitable for handling a flow of 50% of one CW pump flow with electrically operated butterfly valve (with actuators).
* Complete piping including discharge piping/header of CW pumps, CW duct from CW pump house to condensers and from condensers to the cooling towers, blow down piping (up to ash handling plant and central monitoring basin of ETP), fittings &amp; valves and other accessories as required.
* EOT crane for handling &amp; maintenance of CW pumps and monorail and electrically operated pendant control hoist arrangement for maintenance of stoplog gates and trash racks.
* One number trash rack for CW pump house bay and two numbers of stop logs for CW pump house.
* Air release valves, with isolation valves, in CW piping as per the system requirement.
* Hydraulic transient analysis of CW system.
* CW pump model study and CW pump house/ sump model studies as required.

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

'''Computational phylogenetics''' is the application of computational [[algorithm]]s, methods, and programs to [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The goal is to assemble a [[phylogenetic tree]] representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry of a set of [[gene]]s, [[species]], or other [[taxa]]. For example, these techniques have been used to explore the family tree of [[hominid]] species&lt;ref name="Strait"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strait | first1 = DS | last2 = Grine | first2 = FE | year = 2004 | title = Inferring hominoid and early hominid phylogeny using craniodental characters: the role of fossil taxa | url = | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 47 | issue = 6| pages = 399–452 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.008 | pmid=15566946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships between specific genes shared by many types of organisms.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = T | last2 = Cope | first2 = MJ | year = 2000 | title = A myosin family tree | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 3353–3354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional phylogenetics relies on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data obtained by measuring and quantifying the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] properties of representative organisms, while the more recent field of molecular phylogenetics uses [[nucleotide]] sequences encoding genes or [[amino acid]] sequences encoding [[protein]]s as the basis for classification. Many forms of molecular phylogenetics are closely related to and make extensive use of [[sequence alignment]] in constructing and refining phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous [[gene]]s represented in the [[genome]]s of divergent species. The phylogenetic trees constructed by computational methods are unlikely to perfectly reproduce the [[evolutionary tree]] that represents the historical relationships between the species being analyzed. The historical species tree may also differ from the historical tree of an individual homologous gene shared by those species.

==Types of phylogenetic trees and networks==
[[Phylogenetic tree]]s generated by computational phylogenetics can be either ''rooted'' or ''unrooted'' depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a [[directed graph]] that explicitly identifies a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as [[leaf node]]s and their distances from the root proportional to their [[genetic distance]] from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one "outgroup" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.

By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mount DM.

The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional "tree space" through which search paths can be traced by [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.&lt;ref name="felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be further generalized to rooted or unrooted [[phylogenetic network]]s, which allow for the modeling of evolutionary phenomena such as [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Coding characters and defining homology==
===Morphological analysis===
The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;Swiderski DL, Zelditch ML, Fink WL. (1998). Why morphometrics is not special: coding quantitative data for phylogenetic analysis. 47(3):508-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of [[convergent evolution]] of phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaubert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaubert | first1 = P | last2 = Wozencraft | first2 = WC | last3 = Cordeiro-Estrela | first3 = P | last4 = Veron | first4 = G | year = 2005 | title = Mosaics of convergences and noise in morphological phylogenies: what's in a viverrid-like carnivoran? | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 865–894 | doi=10.1080/10635150500232769| pmid = 16282167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete [[fossil]] records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of [[ape]]s produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.&lt;ref name="Strait" /&gt;

Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, for example, is straightforward in the majority of cases, as is counting features such as eyes or vertebrae. However, the most appropriate representation of continuously varying phenotypic measurements is a controversial problem without a general solution. A common method is simply to sort the measurements of interest into two or more classes, rendering continuous observed variation as discretely classifiable (e.g., all examples with humerus bones longer than a given cutoff are scored as members of one state, and all members whose humerus bones are shorter than the cutoff are scored as members of a second state). This results in an easily manipulated [[data set]] but has been criticized for poor reporting of the basis for the class definitions and for sacrificing information compared to methods that use a continuous weighted distribution of measurements.&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiens | first1 = JJ | year = 2001 | title = Character analysis in morphological phylogenetics: problems and solutions | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 689–699 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328811| pmid = 12116939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.&lt;ref name="Jenner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenner | first1 = RA | year = 2001 | title = Bilaterian phylogeny and uncritical recycling of morphological data sets | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 730–743 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular analysis===
The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct [[nucleotide]]s in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences and distinct [[amino acid]]s in [[protein]] sequences. However, defining [[homology (biology)|homology]] can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are "[[mutation]]s" versus ancestral characters, and which events are [[insertion (genetics)|insertion mutations]] or [[deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]]. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.
&lt;!-- more here on the effects of mutation rates--&gt;

==Distance-matrix methods==
{{Main|Distance matrices in phylogeny}}
Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of "genetic distance" between the sequences being classified, and therefore they require an MSA as an input. Distance is often defined as the fraction of mismatches at aligned positions, with gaps either ignored or counted as mismatches.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same [[interior node]] and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of [[multiple sequence alignment]]s. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===UPGMA and WPGMA===
{{Main|UPGMA}}
{{Main|WPGMA}}

The [[UPGMA]] (''Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') and [[WPGMA]] (''Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') methods produce rooted trees and require a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an [[ultrametric]] tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokal R and Michener C |title=A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships |journal=University of Kansas Science Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=1409–1438 |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbor-joining===
{{Main|Neighbor joining}}

Neighbor-joining methods apply general [[cluster analysis]] techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple [[neighbor-joining]] method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a [[molecular clock]]) across lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=N.|last2=Nei|first2=M.|date=1987-07-01|title=The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/406|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=406–425|issn=0737-4038|pmid=3447015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitch-Margoliash method===
The [[Distance matrices in phylogeny#Fitch-Margoliash method|Fitch-Margoliash method]] uses a weighted [[least squares]] method for clustering based on genetic distance.&lt;ref name="fitch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | authorlink = Walter M. Fitch | authorlink2 = Emanuel Margoliash | last2 = Margoliash | first2 = E. | year = 1967 | title = Construction of phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3760| pages = 279–284 | doi=10.1126/science.155.3760.279 | pmid=5334057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be [[linear]]; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the [[expected value]]s of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]]s at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a [[substitution matrix]] such as that derived from the [[Jukes-Cantor model]] of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Another modification of the algorithm can be helpful, especially in case of concentrated distances (please report to [[concentration of measure]] phenomenon and [[curse of dimensionality]]): that modification, described in,&lt;ref name="Lespinats"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lespinats | first1 = S. | last2 = Grando | first2 = D. | last3 = Maréchal | first3 = E. | last4 = Hakimi | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tenaillon | first5 = O. | last6 = Bastien | first6 = O. | year = 2011 | title = How Fitch-Margoliash Algorithm can benefit from Multi Dimensional Scaling | url = | journal = [[Evolutionary Bioinformatics]] | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 61–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and its robustness.

The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = William HE | year = 1987 | title = Computational complexity of inferring phylogenies from dissimilarity matrices | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824087800071 | journal = [[Bulletin of Mathematical Biology]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–467 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(87)80007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[heuristic]] search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.

===Using outgroups===
Independent information about the relationship between sequences or groups can be used to help reduce the tree search space and root unrooted trees. Standard usage of distance-matrix methods involves the inclusion of at least one [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] sequence known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest in the query set.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; This usage can be seen as a type of [[experimental control]]. If the outgroup has been appropriately chosen, it will have a much greater [[genetic distance]] and thus a longer branch length than any other sequence, and it will appear near the root of a rooted tree. Choosing an appropriate outgroup requires the selection of a sequence that is moderately related to the sequences of interest; too close a relationship defeats the purpose of the outgroup and too distant adds [[signal noise|noise]] to the analysis.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid situations in which the species from which the sequences were taken are distantly related, but the gene encoded by the sequences is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] across lineages. [[Horizontal gene transfer]], especially between otherwise divergent [[bacteria]], can also confound outgroup usage.

==Maximum parsimony==
[[Maximum parsimony]] (MP) is a method of identifying the potential phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of [[evolution]]ary events to explain the observed sequence data. Some ways of scoring trees also include a "cost" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular [[nucleotide]]s or [[amino acid]]s are known to be more mutable than others.

The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be [[NP-hard]];&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; consequently a number of [[heuristic]] search methods for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the best in the set. Most such methods involve a [[steepest descent]]-style minimization mechanism operating on a [[tree rearrangement]] criterion.

===Branch and bound===
The [[branch and bound]] algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of [[NP-hard]] problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="hendy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = MD | last2 = Penny | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Branch and bound algorithms to determine minimal evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Math Biosci | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 133–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a [[tree structure]] as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules&lt;ref name="zharkikh"&gt;Ratner VA, Zharkikh AA, Kolchanov N, Rodin S, Solovyov S, Antonov AS. (1995). ''Molecular Evolution'' Biomathematics Series Vol 24. Springer-Verlag: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate "most parsimonious" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.

===Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm===
The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences.&lt;ref name="sankoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sankoff | first1 = D | last2 = Morel | first2 = C | last3 = Cedergren | first3 = RJ | year = 1973 | title = Evolution of 5S RNA and the non-randomness of base replacement | url = | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 147| pages = 232–234 | doi=10.1038/newbio245232a0 | pmid=4201431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method uses a [[maximum parsimony]] calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events (an alternative view holds that the trees to be favored are those that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology, a point of view that may lead to different optimal trees &lt;ref name="de_laet2005"&gt;De Laet J. (2005). Parsimony and the problem of inapplicables in sequence data. Pp. 81-116 in Albert, V.A. (ed.) ''Parsimony, phylogeny and genomics.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-856493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The imputed sequences at the [[interior node]]s of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===MALIGN and POY===
More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a [[cladogram]] score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = WC | last2 = Gladstein | first2 = DG | year = 1994 | title = MALIGN: a multiple nucleic acid sequence alignment program | url = | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 417–418 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = MP | year = 2004 | title = Independence of alignment and tree search | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 874–879 | pmid = 15120385 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has been countered by the view that such methods should be seen as heuristic approaches to find the trees that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology.&lt;ref name="de_laet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de_laet2015"&gt;

==Maximum likelihood==
The [[maximum likelihood]] method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring [[probability distribution]]s to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a [[substitution model]] to assess the probability of particular [[mutation]]s; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be [[statistically independent]]. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but it is believed to be computationally intractable to compute due to its NP-hardness.&lt;ref name="chor"&gt;Chor B, Tuller T. (2005). Maximum likelihood of evolutionary trees: hardness and approximation. ''Bioinformatics'' 21.suppl 1:  i97-i106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pruning" algorithm, a variant of [[dynamic programming]], is often used to reduce the search space by efficiently calculating the likelihood of subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; The method calculates the likelihood for each site in a "linear" manner, starting at a node whose only descendants are leaves (that is, the tips of the tree) and working backwards toward the "bottom" node in nested sets. However, the trees produced by the method are only rooted if the substitution model is irreversible, which is not generally true of biological systems. The search for the maximum-likelihood tree also includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general [[global optimization]] tools such as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method are often used.

==Bayesian inference==&lt;!--There is at least one wikilink here, so fix if you change the section title--&gt;
{{Main|Bayesian inference in phylogeny}}
[[Bayesian inference]] can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior [[probability distribution]] of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as [[speciation]] occur as [[stochastic process]]es. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step&lt;ref name="Mau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mau | first1 = B | last2 = Newton | first2 = MA | year = 1997 | title = Phylogenetic inference for binary data on dendrograms using Markov chain Monte Carlo | url = | journal = J Comp Graph Stat | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 122–131 | doi=10.2307/1390728| jstor = 1390728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and swapping descendant subtrees of a random [[internal node]] between two related trees.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z | last2 = Rannala | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = bayesian phylogenetic inference using DNA sequences: a Markov chain Monte Carlo method | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 717–724 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  Bayesian methods are generally held to be superior to parsimony-based methods; they can be more prone to long-branch attraction than maximum likelihood techniques,&lt;ref name="Kolaczkowski2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kolaczkowski | first1 = B. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J.

Whereas likelihood methods find the tree that maximizes the probability of the data, a Bayesian approach recovers a tree that represents the most likely clades, by drawing on the posterior distribution.  However, estimates of the posterior probability of clades (measuring their 'support') can be quite wide of the mark, especially in clades that aren't overwhelmingly likely. As such, other methods have been put forwards to estimate posterior probability.&lt;ref name="Larget2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larget | first1 = B. | title = The Estimation of Tree Posterior Probabilities Using Conditional Clade Probability Distributions | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt014 | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–511 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23479066| pmc =3676676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model selection==
Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined [[substitution model]] that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of [[mutation]] at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the [[genetic distance]] between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before [[coalescent theory|coalescence]]). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of [[long branch attraction]], or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152633 | title = Model Selection in Phylogenetics | year = 2005 | author = Sullivan, Jack | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 445–466 | last2 = Joyce | first2 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===Types of models===
{{Main|Substitution model}}

All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G&gt;C nucleotide mutation as to a C&gt;G mutation. The simplest possible model, the [[Jukes-Cantor model]], assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; More advanced models distinguish between [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.&lt;ref name="Galtier"&gt;Galtier N, Guoy M. (1998.) Inferring pattern and process: maximum-likelihood implementation of a nonhomogeneous model of DNA sequence evolution for phylogenetic analysis. ''Mol. Biol. Evol.'' 15:871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models may also allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base [[codon]]s. If the location of the [[open reading frame]] (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that [[wobble base pair]]ing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the [[gamma distribution]] or [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the [[covarion]] method allows [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.&lt;ref name="FitchMarkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | last2 = Markowitz | first2 = E | year = 1970 | title = An improved method for determining codon variability in a gene and its application to the rate of fixation of mutations in evolution | url = | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 579–593 | doi=10.1007/bf00486096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing the best model===
The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The most common method of model selection is the [[likelihood ratio test]] (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of "[[goodness of fit]]" between the model and the input data.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  For this reason model selection computer programs will choose the simplest model that is not significantly worse than more complex substitution models. A significant disadvantage of the LRT is the necessity of making a series of pairwise comparisons between models; it has been shown that the order in which the models are compared has a major effect on the one that is eventually selected.&lt;ref name="Pol"&gt;Pol D. (2004.) Empirical problems of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test for model selection. ''Syst Biol'' 53:949–962.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model selection method is the [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC), formally an estimate of the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the true model and the model being tested. It can be interpreted as a likelihood estimate with a correction factor to penalize overparameterized models.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The AIC is calculated on an individual model rather than a pair, so it is independent of the order in which models are assessed. A related alternative, the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC), has a similar basic interpretation but penalizes complex models more heavily.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

A comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models) and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at ''Nature Protocol''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/protex.2013.065 | title=Sequence similarity search, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Model Selection, Distance Matrix and Phylogeny Reconstruction | year=2013 | journal=Protocol Exchange | last1 = Bast | first1 = Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non traditional way of evaluating the phylogenetic tree is to compare it with clustering result. One can use a Multidimensional Scaling technique, so called Interpolative Joining to do dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustering result for the sequences in 3D, and then map the phylogenetic tree onto the clustering result. A better tree usually has a higher correlation with the clustering result.&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Yang, et al.

== Evaluating tree support==
As with all statistical analysis, the estimation of phylogenies from character data requires an evaluation of confidence. A number of methods exist to test the amount of support for a phylogenetic tree, either by evaluating the support for each sub-tree in the phylogeny (nodal support) or evaluating whether the phylogeny is significantly different from other possible trees (alternative tree hypothesis tests).

===Nodal support===
The most common method for assessing tree support is to evaluate the statistical support for each node on the tree. Typically, a node with very low support is not considered valid in further analysis, and visually may be collapsed into a [[polytomy]] to indicate that relationships within a clade are unresolved.

====Consensus tree====
Many methods for assessing nodal support involve consideration of multiple phylogenies. The consensus tree summarizes the nodes that are shared among a set of trees.&lt;ref name="BaumSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Baum|author2=Stacey D. Smith|title=Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW_ApwAACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Roberts|isbn=978-1-936221-16-5|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a *strict consensus,* only nodes found in every tree are shown, and the rest are collapsed into an unresolved [[polytomy]]. Less conservative methods, such as the *majority-rule consensus* tree, consider nodes that are supported by a given percentage of trees under consideration (such as at least 50%).

For example, in maximum parsimony analysis, there may be many trees with the same parsimony score. A strict consensus tree would show which nodes are found in all equally parsimonious trees, and which nodes differ. Consensus trees are also used to evaluate support on phylogenies reconstructed with Bayesian inference (see below).

====Bootstrapping and jackknifing====
In statistics, the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] is a method for inferring the variability of data that has an unknown distribution using pseudoreplications of the original data. For example, given a set of 100 data points, a [[pseudoreplicate]] is a data set of the same size (100 points) randomly sampled from the original data, with replacement. That is, each original data point may be represented more than once in the pseudoreplicate, or not at all. Statistical support involves evaluation of whether the original data has similar properties to a large set of pseudoreplicates.

In phylogenetics, bootstrapping is conducted using the columns of the character matrix. Each pseudoreplicate contains the same number of species (rows) and characters (columns) randomly sampled from the original matrix, with replacement. A phylogeny is reconstructed from each pseudoreplicate, with the same methods used to reconstruct the phylogeny from the original data. For each node on the phylogeny, the nodal support is the percentage of pseudoreplicates containing that node.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|title=Confidence Limits on Phylogenies: An Approach Using the Bootstrap|journal=Evolution|volume=39|issue=4|year=1985|pages=783–791|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.2307/2408678|pmid=28561359|jstor=2408678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical rigor of the bootstrap test has been empirically evaluated using viral populations with known evolutionary histories,&lt;ref name="HillisBull1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillis|first1=D. M.|last2=Bull|first2=J. J.|title=An Empirical Test of Bootstrapping as a Method for Assessing Confidence in Phylogenetic Analysis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=42|issue=2|year=1993|pages=182–192|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.2.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that 70% bootstrap support corresponds to a 95% probability that the clade exists. However, this was tested under ideal conditions (e.g. no change in evolutionary rates, symmetric phylogenies). In practice, values above 70% are generally supported and left to the researcher or reader to evaluate confidence. Nodes with support lower than 70% are typically considered unresolved.

Jackknifing in phylogenetics is a similar procedure, except the columns of the matrix are sampled without replacement. Pseudoreplicates are generated by randomly subsampling the data—for example, a "10% jackknife" would involve randomly sampling 10% of the matrix many times to evaluate nodal support.

==== Posterior probability ====
Reconstruction of phylogenies using [[Bayesian inference]] generates a posterior distribution of highly probable trees given the data and evolutionary model, rather than a single "best" tree. The trees in the posterior distribution generally have many different topologies. Most Bayesian inference methods utilize a Markov-chain Monte Carlo iteration, and the initial steps of this chain are not considered reliable reconstructions of the phylogeny. Trees generated early in the chain are usually discarded as [[burn-in]]. The most common method of evaluating nodal support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the percentage of trees in the posterior distribution (post-burn-in) which contain the node.

The statistical support for a node in Bayesian inference is expected to reflect the probability that a clade really exists given the data and evolutionary model.&lt;ref name="HuelsenbeckRannala2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huelsenbeck|first1=John|last2=Rannala|first2=Bruce|title=Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities of Phylogenetic Trees Under Simple and Complex Substitution Models|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=53|issue=6|year=2004|pages=904–913|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1080/10635150490522629|pmid=15764559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the threshold for accepting a node as supported is generally higher than for bootstrapping.

==== Step counting methods====
[[Bremer support]] counts the number of extra steps needed to contradict a clade.

===Shortcomings ===
These measures each have their weaknesses. For example, smaller or larger clades tend to attract larger support values than mid-sized clades, simply as a result of the number of taxa in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12024| title = Evaluating the clade size effect in alternative measures of branch support| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| pages = n/a| year = 2013| last1 = Chemisquy | first1 = M. A. A. | last2 = Prevosti | first2 = F. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootstrap support can provide high estimates of node support as a result of noise in the data rather than the true existence of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh137| pmid = 15084674| title = Genome-Scale Phylogeny and the Detection of Systematic Biases| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1455–1458| year = 2004| last1 = Phillips | first1 = M. J.| last2 = Delsuc| first2 = F| last3 = Penny| first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and workarounds ==
Ultimately, there is no way to measure whether a particular phylogenetic hypothesis is accurate or not, unless the true relationships among the taxa being examined are already known (which may happen with bacteria or viruses under laboratory conditions). The best result an empirical phylogeneticist can hope to attain is a tree with branches that are well supported by the available evidence. Several potential pitfalls have been identified:

=== Homoplasy ===
{{main|Convergent evolution}}
Certain characters are more likely to [[Convergent evolution|evolve convergently]] than others; logically, such characters should be given less weight in the reconstruction of a tree.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x |title=Weighting against homoplasy improves phylogenetic analysis of morphological data sets |year=2008 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |last2=Carpenter |first2=James M. |last3=Arias |first3=J. Salvador |last4=Esquivel |first4=Daniel Rafael Miranda |journal=Cladistics |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=758–773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weights in the form of a model of evolution can be inferred from sets of molecular data, so that [[maximum likelihood]] or [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] methods can be used to analyze them. For molecular sequences, this problem is exacerbated when the taxa under study have diverged substantially. As time since the divergence of two taxa increase, so does the probability of multiple substitutions on the same site, or back mutations, all of which result in homoplasies.  For morphological data, unfortunately, the only objective way to determine convergence is by the construction of a tree&amp;nbsp;– a somewhat circular method. Even so, weighting homoplasious characters{{how|date=September 2012}} does indeed lead to better-supported trees.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008/&gt; Further refinement can be brought by weighting changes in one direction higher than changes in another; for instance, the presence of thoracic wings almost guarantees placement among the pterygote insects because, although wings are often lost secondarily, there is no evidence that they have been gained more than once.&lt;ref name=Goloboff1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1997.tb00317.x |title=Self-Weighted Optimization: Tree Searches and Character State Reconstructions under Implied Transformation Costs |year=1997 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |journal=Cladistics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
In general, organisms can inherit genes in two ways: vertical gene transfer and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Vertical gene transfer is the passage of genes from parent to offspring, and horizontal (also called lateral) gene transfer occurs when genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon especially in [[prokaryote]]s; a good example of this is the acquired [[antibiotic resistance]] as a result of gene exchange between various bacteria leading to multi-drug-resistant bacterial species. There have also been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer [[Horizontal gene transfer#Eukaryotes|between eukaryotes]].

Horizontal gene transfer has complicated the determination of phylogenies of organisms, and inconsistencies in phylogeny have been reported among specific groups of organisms depending on the genes used to construct evolutionary trees. The only way to determine which genes have been acquired vertically and which horizontally is to [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] assume that the largest set of genes that have been inherited together have been inherited vertically; this requires analyzing a large number of genes.

=== Hybrids, speciation, introgressions and incomplete  lineage sorting===
The basic assumption underlying the mathematical model of cladistics is a situation where species split neatly in bifurcating fashion. While such an assumption may hold on a larger scale (bar horizontal gene transfer, see above), [[speciation]] is often much less orderly. Research since the cladistic method was introduced has shown that [[hybrid speciation]], once thought rare, is in fact quite common, particularly in plants.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, J F. &amp; Doyle, J.J.

Kluwer, Boston, pp. 265–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[paraspecies|paraphyletic speciation]] is common, making the assumption of a bifurcating pattern unsuitable, leading to [[phylogenetic network]]s rather than trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = D.

Our current knowledge of processes such as hybridization, endosymbiosis and lateral gene transfer makes clear that the evolutionary history of life on Earth cannot accurately be depicted as a single, typological, bifurcating tree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Introgression]] can also move genes between otherwise distinct species and sometimes even genera, complicating phylogenetic analysis based on genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qu|first1=Yanhua|last2=Zhang|first2=Ruiying|last3=Quan|first3=Qing|last4=Song|first4=Gang|last5=Li|first5=Shou Hsien|last6=Lei|first6=Fumin|title=Incomplete lineage sorting or secondary admixture: disentangling historical divergence from recent gene flow in the Vinous-throated parrotbill (''Paradoxornis webbianus'')|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=December 2012|volume=21|issue=24|pages=6117–6133|doi=10.1111/mec.12080|pmid=23095021}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can contribute to "incomplete lineage sorting" and is thought to be a common phenomenon across a number of groups. In species level analysis this can be dealt with by larger sampling or better whole genome analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Iyer|first2=Venky N.|last3=Moses|first3=Alan M.|last4=Eisen|first4=Michael B.|title=Widespread Discordance of Gene Trees with Species Tree in Drosophila: Evidence for Incomplete Lineage Sorting|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2006|volume=2|issue=10|pages=e173|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|pmid=17132051|pmc=1626107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the problem is avoided by restricting the analysis to fewer, not closely related specimens.

=== Taxon sampling ===
Owing to the development of advanced sequencing techniques in [[molecular biology]], it has become feasible to gather large amounts of data (DNA or amino acid sequences) to infer phylogenetic hypotheses. For example, it is not rare to find studies with character matrices based on whole [[mitochondrial]] genomes (~16,000 nucleotides, in many animals). However, simulations have shown that it is more important to increase the number of taxa in the matrix than to increase the number of characters, because the more taxa there are, the more accurate and more robust is the resulting phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Zwickl2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150290102339 |title=Increased Taxon Sampling Greatly Reduces Phylogenetic Error |year=2002 |last1=Zwickl |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Hillis |first2=David M. |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=588–598 |pmid=12228001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.04.001 |title=Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses |year=2006 |last1=Wiens |first1=John J. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=39 |pages=34–42 |pmid=15922672 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to the breaking up of [[long branch attraction|long branches]].

=== Phylogenetic signal ===
Another important factor that affects the accuracy of tree reconstruction is whether the data analyzed actually contain a useful phylogenetic signal, a term that is used generally to denote whether a character evolves slowly enough to have the same state in closely related taxa as opposed to varying randomly. Tests for phylogenetic signal exist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12778543 |year=2003 |last1=Blomberg |first1=Simon P. |last2=Garland Jr |first2=Theodore |last3=Ives |first3=Anthony R. |title=Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=717–745 |journal=Evolution |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous characters ===
Morphological characters that sample a continuum may contain phylogenetic signal, but are hard to code as discrete characters. Several methods have been used, one of which is gap coding, and there are variations on gap coding.&lt;ref name=Archie1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Archie, J.W.|year=1985|title=Methods for coding variable morphological features for numerical taxonomic analysis|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=326–345|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/326.abstract|doi=10.2307/2413151|jstor=2413151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original form of gap coding:&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;group means for a character are first ordered by size. The pooled within-group standard deviation is calculated ... and differences between adjacent means ... are compared relative to this standard deviation. Any pair of adjacent means is considered different and given different integer scores ... if the means are separated by a "gap" greater than the within-group standard deviation ... times some arbitrary constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If more taxa are added to the analysis, the gaps between taxa may become so small that all information is lost. Generalized gap coding works around that problem by comparing individual pairs of taxa rather than considering one set that contains all of the taxa.&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;

=== Missing data ===
In general, the more data that are available when constructing a tree, the more accurate and reliable the resulting tree will be. Missing data are no more detrimental than simply having fewer data, although the impact is greatest when most of the missing data are in a small number of taxa. Concentrating the missing data across a small number of characters produces a more robust tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prevosti |first1=Francisco J. |last2=Chemisquy |first2=María A. |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00289.x |title=The impact of missing data on real morphological phylogenies: Influence of the number and distribution of missing entries |year=2009 |journal=Cladistics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fossils ==
Because many characters involve embryological, or soft-tissue or molecular characters that (at best) hardly ever fossilize, and the interpretation of fossils is more ambiguous than that of [[Extant taxon|living taxa]], extinct taxa almost invariably have higher proportions of missing data than living ones. However, despite these limitations, the inclusion of fossils is invaluable, as they can provide information in sparse areas of trees, breaking up long branches and constraining intermediate character states; thus, fossil taxa contribute as much to tree resolution as modern taxa.&lt;ref name=Cobbett2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150701627296 |title=Fossils Impact as Hard as Living Taxa in Parsimony Analyses of Morphology |year=2007 |last1=Cobbett |first1=Andrea |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Mark |last3=Wills |first3=Matthew |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=753–766 |pmid=17886145}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils can also constrain the age of lineages and thus demonstrate how consistent a tree is with the stratigraphic record;&lt;ref name="Huelsenbeck"&gt;
{{cite journal |first1=John P. |last1=Huelsenbeck |year=1994 |title=Comparing the Stratigraphic Record to Estimates of Phylogeny |journal=Paleobiology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=470–483 |jstor=2401230 |doi=10.1017/s009483730001294x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stratocladistics]] incorporates age information into data matrices for phylogenetic analyses.

The '''Congrès internationaux d'architecture moderne''' (CIAM), or International Congresses of [[Modern Architecture]], was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the [[Modern architecture|Modern Movement]] focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==

The International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], Hélène de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and [[Sigfried Giedion]] (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th century [[manifesto]]s meant to advance the cause of "architecture as a social art".

Other founder members included [[Karl Moser]] (first president), [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Hendrik Berlage]], [[Victor Bourgeois]], [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], Max Ernst Haefeli, [[Hugo Häring]], Arnold Höchel, Huib Hoste, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (cousin of Le Corbusier), [[André Lurçat]], [[Ernst May]], [[Max Cetto]], Fernando García Mercadal, [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Werner M. Moser]], Carlo Enrico Rava, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, [[Mart Stam]], Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were to be [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Kolli]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Other later members included [[Minnette de Silva]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Uno Åhrén]], [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] (1929) and [[Fred Forbát]]. In 1941, [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]] was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in [[New York City]].

[[Josep Lluís Sert]], co-founder of [[GATEPAC]] and [[GATCPAC]] (in [[Saragossa|Saragoza]] and [[Barcelona]], respectively) in 1930, as well as ADLAN (Friends of New Art) in Barcelona in 1932, participated in the congresses as of 1929, and served as CIAM president from 1947 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4uNElGkBoYC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=CIAM+1929+Sert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhCO-MI962&amp;sig=tWngBDDQgFw4flUp-TWeg9d851k&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6sMU8-cL_OZ0AXAj4FQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=CIAM%201929%20Sert&amp;f=false "The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960"], by Eric Paul Mumford.

The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through [[urban planning]].

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier's competition entry for the [[Palace of the Soviets]], a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM's principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held onboard ship, the SS Patris II, which sailed from [[Marseille]] to [[Athens]].

Here the group discussed the principles of "The Functional City", which broadened CIAM's scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the "[[Athens Charter]]."

As CIAM members traveled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following [[World War II]], although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. [[Mart Stam]]'s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an "all-out attack on the city."

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group [[Team 10]] was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob B. Bakema]]).

==CIRPAC==
The elected executive body of CIAM was CIRPAC, the ''Comité international pour la résolution des problèmes de l’architecture contemporaine'' (International Committee for the Resolution of Problems in Contemporary Architecture).

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], especially the study of [[mechanics]] and [[fluid dynamics]], the '''d'Alembert-Euler condition''' is a requirement that the [[streakline]]s of a flow are [[irrotational]].  Let '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''x'''('''X''',''t'') be the coordinates of the point '''x''' into which '''X''' is carried at time ''t'' by a (fluid) flow.  Let &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{D^2\mathbf{x}}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; be the second [[material derivative]] of '''x'''.  Then the d'Alembert-Euler condition is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{curl}\  \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The d'Alembert-Euler condition is named for [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] who independently first described its use in the mid-18th century.  It is not to be confused with the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann conditions]].

It elaborates on "Communication Fundamentals", "Models of Communication" and studies the "Future through Communication". It draws on several theories including concepts of meme from [[Richard Dawkins]] 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', the book builds on theories of Brand [[Trust (social sciences)|Trust]], Brand Appeal, [[Perception]] and [[Propaganda]]. The books applies concepts of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] to communication showing the importance of [[Sustainable]] Communication to the future of mankind.

The '''epithelial–mesenchymal transition''' ('''EMT''') is a process by which [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells lose their [[cell polarity]] and cell-cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties to become [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s; these are [[multipotent]] [[stromal cell]]s that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. EMT is essential for numerous developmental processes including [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] formation and [[neural tube]] formation. EMT has also been shown to occur in [[wound healing]], in organ [[fibrosis]] and in the initiation of [[metastasis]] in cancer progression.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Gray17.png|thumb|300px| Human embryo—length, 2 mm. Dorsal view, with the amnion laid open. X 30.]]

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition was first recognized as a feature of embryogenesis by [[Betty Hay]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-Phenotypic Cells: Are They Cousins or Twins?|url=|journal=Cancers (Basel)|volume=3|issue=1|pages=716–29|doi=10.3390/cancers30100716|pmc=3106306|pmid=21643534|vauthors=Kong D, Li Y, Wang Z, Sarkar FH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamouille|first=Samy|last2=Xu|first2=Jian|last3=Derynck|first3=Rik|date=March 2014|title=Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=178–196|doi=10.1038/nrm3758|pmc=4240281|pmid=24556840}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMT, and its reverse process, MET ([[Mesenchymal–epithelial transition|mesenchymal-epithelial transition]]) are critical for development of many tissues and organs in the developing embryo, and numerous embryonic events such as [[gastrulation]], [[neural crest]] formation, [[heart valve]] formation, palatogenesis and [[myogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions in Development and Disease|url=|journal=Cell|volume=139|issue=5|pages=871–890|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.007|pmid=19945376|vauthors=Thiery JP, Acloque H, Huang YJ, Nieto MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithelial and mesenchymal cells differ in phenotype as well as function, though both share inherent plasticity.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Epithelial cells are closely connected to each other by [[tight junction]]s, [[gap junction]]s and [[adherens junction]]s, have an apico-basal [[Cell polarity|polarity]], polarization of the [[Actin cytoskeleton|actin]] [[cytoskeleton]] and are bound by a [[basal lamina]] at their basal surface. Mesenchymal cells, on the other hand, lack this polarization, have a spindle-shaped morphology and interact with each other only through focal points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=131–142|doi=10.1038/nrm1835|pmid=16493418|vauthors=Thiery JP, Sleeman JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithelial cells express high levels of [[E-cadherin]], whereas mesenchymal cells express those of [[N-cadherin]], [[fibronectin]] and [[vimentin]]. Thus, EMT entails profound morphological and phenotypic changes to a cell.

Based on the biological context, EMT has been categorized into 3 types : developmental (Type I), [[fibrosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Martel|first2=N|last3=Pennisi|first3=DJ|last4=Little|first4=MH|last5=Wilkinson|first5=L|date=April 2013|title=Distinct sites of renal fibrosis in Crim1 mutant mice arise from multiple cellular origins|journal=The Journal of Pathology|volume=229|issue=5|pages=685–96|doi=10.1002/path.4155|pmid=23224993|last1=Phua|first1=YL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wound healing]] (Type II), and [[cancer]] (Type III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=The basics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=119|issue=6|pages=1420–1428|doi=10.1172/JCI39104|pmc=2689101|pmid=19487818|vauthors=Kalluri R, Weinberg RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sciacovelli|first=Marco|last2=Frezza|first2=Christian|date=2017-04-26|title=Metabolic reprogramming and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer|url=|journal=The FEBS Journal|doi=10.1111/febs.14090|pmid=28444969|pmc=6049610|volume=284|issue=19|pages=3132–3144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Linna|last2=Li|first2=Wenliang|date=June 2015|title=Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human cancer: comprehensive reprogramming of metabolism, epigenetics, and differentiation|url=|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|volume=150|pages=33–46|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.01.004|pmid=25595324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of [[E-cadherin]] is considered to be a fundamental event in EMT. Many [[transcription factor]]s (TFs) that can repress E-cadherin directly or indirectly can be considered as EMT-TF (EMT inducing TFs). [[SNAI1]]/Snail 1, [[SNAI2]]/Snail 2 (also known as Slug), [[ZEB1]], [[ZEB2]], [[TCF3]] and [[KLF8]] (Kruppel-like factor 8) can bind to the E-cadherin promoter and repress its transcription, whereas factors such as [[twist transcription factor|Twist]], [[Goosecoid protein|Goosecoid]], [[TCF4]] (also known as E2.2), homeobox protein [[SIX1]] and [[FOXC2]] (fork-head box protein C2) repress E-cadherin indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peinado H, Olmeda D, Cano A | title = Snail, Zeb and bHLH factors in tumour progression: an alliance against the epithelial phenotype? | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 415–428 | year = 2007 | url =  | doi=10.1038/nrc2131 | pmid=17508028| hdl = 10261/81769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Weinberg RA | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis | journal = Dev Cell | volume = 14 | pages = 818–829 | year = 2008 | url =| doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2008.05.009 | pmid=18539112 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAIL and ZEB factors bind to E-box consensus sequences on the promoter region, while KLF8 binds to promoter through GT boxes.

==In development and wound healing==

After the initial stage of embryogenesis, the implantation of the embryo and the initiation of [[placenta]] formation are associated with EMT. The trophoectoderm cells undergo EMT to facilitate the invasion of [[endometrium]] and appropriate placenta placement, thus enabling nutrient and gas exchange to the embryo. Later in embryogenesis, during gastrulation, EMT allows the cells to ingress in a specific area of the embryo – the [[primitive streak]] in [[amniotes]], and the ventral furrow in [[Drosophila]]. The cells in this tissue express E-cadherin and apical-basal polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|vauthors=Lim R, Thiery JP | title=Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions: insights from development| journal = Development | volume= 139 | issue= 19| pages= 3471–3486| year= 2012| doi= 10.1242/dev.071209 | pmid=22949611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since gastrulation is a very rapid process, E-cadherin is repressed transcriptionally by [[twist transcription factor|Twist]] and [[SNAI1]] (commonly called ''Snail''), and at the protein level by P38 interacting protein. The primitive streak, through invagination, further generates mesoendoderm, which separates to form a mesoderm and an endoderm, again through EMT. Mesenchymal cells from the primitive streak participate also in the formation of many epithelial mesodermal organs, such as notochord as well as somites, through the reverse of EMT, i.e. [[mesenchymal–epithelial transition]]. [[Amphioxus]] forms an epithelial neural tube and dorsal notochord but does not have the EMT potential of the [[primitive streak]]. In higher chordates, the mesenchyme originates out of the primitive streak migrates anteriorly to form the somites and participate with neural crest mesenchyme in formation of the heart mesoderm.

In vertebrates, [[epithelium]] and [[mesenchyme]] are the basic tissue phenotypes. During embryonic development, migratory [[neural crest]] cells are generated by EMT involving the epithelial cells of the neuroectoderm. As a result, these cells dissociate from neural folds, gain motility, and disseminate to various parts of the embryo, where they differentiate to many other cell types. Also, craniofacial crest mesenchyme that forms the connective tissue forming the head and face, is formed by [[neural tube]] epithelium by EMT.&lt;ref name="pmid15937929"/&gt; EMT takes place during the construction of the vertebral column out of the [[extracellular matrix]], which is to be synthesized by [[fibroblast]]s and [[osteoblast]]s that encircle the neural tube. The major source of these cells are [[sclerotome]] and [[somite]] mesenchyme as well as [[primitive streak]]. Mesenchymal morphology allows the cells to travel to specific targets in the embryo, where they differentiate and/or induce differentiation of other cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15937929"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hay ED | title = The mesenchymal cell, its role in the embryo, and the remarkable signaling mechanisms that create it | journal=Dev.

During wound healing, keratinocytes at the border of the wound undergo EMT and undergo re-epithelialization or MET when the wound is closed. Snail2 expression at the migratory front influences this state, as its overexpression accelerates wound healing. Similarly, in each menstrual cycle, the ovarian surface epithelium undergoes EMT during post-ovulatory wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|vauthors=Ahmed N, Maines-Bandiera S, Quinn MA, Unger WG, Dedhar S, Auersperg N | title= Molecular pathways regulating EGF-induced epithelio- mesenchymal transition in human ovarian surface epithelium | journal = Am J Physiol Cell Physiol | volume= 290 | issue= 6| pages= C1532–C1542 | year= 2006 | doi=10.1152/ajpcell.00478.2005| pmid= 16394028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMT confers resistance to [[oncogene]]-induced premature [[senescence]]. Twist1 and Twist2, as well as [[ZEB1]] protects human cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts from senescence.

EMT has been indicated to be involved in acquiring drug resistance. Gain of EMT markers was found to be associated with the resistance of ovarian carcinoma epithelial cell lines to paclitaxel.

== Platelets in cancer EMT ==
[[File:Platelets in cancer EMT.jpg|thumb|490x490px|Cancer cells enter the bloodstream after undergoing EMT induced by TGF-β released from platelets. Once in the bloodstream, metastatic cancer cells recruit platelets for use as a physical barrier that helps protect these cells from elimination by immune cells. The metastatic cancer cell can use the attached platelets to adhere to P-selectin expressed by activated endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Following adhesion to the endothelium, the metastatic cancer cell exits the bloodstream at the secondary site to begin formation of a new tumor.]]

Similar to generation of Cancer Stem Cells, EMT was demonstrated to generate endocrine progenitor cells from human [[pancreatic islet]]s.&lt;ref name="Gershengorn MC, Hardikar AA, Wei C et al. 2004 2261–2264"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gershengorn MC, Hardikar AA, Wei C | year = 2004 | title = Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generates proliferative human islet precursor cells | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230848| journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5705| pages = 2261–2264 | doi=10.1126/science.1101968|display-authors=etal | pmid=15564314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the [[human islet-derived progenitor cell]]s (hIPCs) were proposed to be better precursors since [[Beta cell|β-cell]] progeny in these hIPCs inherit [[epigenetic]] marks that define an active insulin promoter region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gershengorn MC, Geras-Raaka E, Hardikar AA | year = 2005 | title = Are better islet cell precursors generated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition? | url = | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 380–382 | doi=10.4161/cc.4.3.1538|display-authors=etal | pmid=15711124}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later, another set of experiments suggested that labelled β-cells de-differentiate to a mesenchymal-like phenotype ''in vitro'', but fail to proliferate; thus initiating a debate in 2007.&lt;ref name=Atouf2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Atouf F, Park CH, Pechhold K | year = 2007 | title = No evidence for mouse pancreatic beta-cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition ''in vitro'' | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 699–702 | doi=10.2337/db06-1446| pmid = 17327438 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chase2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chase LG, Ulloa-Montoya F, Kidder BL | year = 2007 | title = Islet-derived fibroblast-like cells are not derived via epithelial-mesenchymal transition from Pdx-1 or insulin-positive cells | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 3–7 | doi=10.2337/db06-1165| pmid = 17110468 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton RA, Geras-Raaka E, Wilson LM | year = 2007 | title = Endocrine precursor cells from mouse islets are not generated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of mature beta cells | url = | journal = Mol Cell Endocrinol | volume = 270 | issue = 1–2| pages = 87–93 | doi=10.1016/j.mce.2007.02.005| pmid = 17363142 |display-authors=etal| pmc=1987709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these studies in human islets lacked lineage-tracing analysis, these findings from irreversibly tagged beta cells in mice were extrapolated to human islets. Thus, using a dual lentiviral and genetic lineage tracing system to label β-cells, it was convincingly demonstrated that adult human islet β-cells undergo EMT and proliferate ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russ HA, Bar Y, Ravassard P | year = 2008 | title = In vitro proliferation of cells derived from adult human beta-cells revealed by cell-lineage tracing | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1575–1583 | doi=10.2337/db07-1283|display-authors=etal | pmid=18316362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russ HA, Ravassard P, Kerr-Conte J | year = 2009 | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cells expanded ''in vitro'' from lineage-traced adult human pancreatic beta cells | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 7| page = e6417 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006417| pmid = 19641613 | pmc = 2712769 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these findings were confirmed in human fetal pancreatic insulin-producing cells, and the mesenchymal cells derived from pancreatic islets can undergo the reverse of EMT – MET – to generate islet-like cell aggregates.&lt;ref name=Joglekar2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Joglekar MV, Joglekar VM, Joglekar SV | year = 2009 | title = Human fetal pancreatic insulin-producing cells proliferate ''in vitro'' | url = | journal = J Endocrinol | volume = 201 | issue = 1| pages = 27–36 | doi=10.1677/joe-08-0497 | pmid = 19171567 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept of generating progenitors from insulin-producing cells by EMT or generation of Cancer Stem Cells during EMT in cancer may have potential for replacement therapy in diabetes, and call for drugs targeting inhibition of EMT in cancer.&lt;ref name=Joglekar2009/&gt;

==Partial EMT or a hybrid E/M phenotype==
Not all cells undergo a complete EMT, i.e. losing their cell-cell adhesion and gaining solitary migration characteristics. Instead, most cells undergo partial EMT, 
a state in which they retain some epithelial traits such as cell-cell adhesion or apico-basal polarity, and gain migratory traits, thus cells in this hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype are endowed with special properties such as collective cell migration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jolly|first=Mohit Kumar|last2=Boareto|first2=Marcelo|last3=Huang|first3=Bin|last4=Jia|first4=Dongya|last5=Lu|first5=Mingyang|last6=Ben-Jacob|first6=Eshel|last7=Onuchic|first7=José N.|last8=Levine|first8=Herbert|date=2015-01-01|title=Implications of the Hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal Phenotype in Metastasis|journal=Frontiers in Oncology|volume=5|pages=155|doi=10.3389/fonc.2015.00155|pmc=4507461|pmid=26258068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakaya Y, Sheng G | title = EMT in developmental morphogenesis | journal=Cancer Lett | volume = 341 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | year = 2013 |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7240">In [[computer science]], the '''fetch-and-add''' [[Central processing unit|CPU]] instruction (FAA) [[atomic (computer science)|atomically]] increments the contents of a memory location by a specified value. 

That is, fetch-and-add performs the operation
:increment the value at address {{mvar|x}} by {{mvar|a}}, where {{mvar|x}} is a memory location and {{mvar|a}} is some value, and return the original value at {{mvar|x}}
in such a way that if this operation is executed by one process in a [[concurrent computing|concurrent]] system, no other process will ever see an intermediate result. 

Fetch-and-add can be used to implement [[concurrency control]] structures such as [[mutual exclusion|mutex locks]] and [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]].

==Overview==
The motivation for having an atomic fetch-and-add is that operations that appear in programming languages as

:{{mono|x {{=}} x + a}}

are not safe in a concurrent system, where multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] are running concurrently (either in a [[multi-processor]] system, or [[Preemption (computing)|preemptively]] scheduled onto some single-core systems). The reason is that such an operation is actually implemented as multiple machine instructions:

# Fetch the value at the location {{mvar|x}}, say {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;}}, into a register;
# add {{mvar|a}} to {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the register;
# store the new value of the register back into {{mvar|x}}.

When one process is doing {{mono|x {{=}} x + a}} and another is doing {{mono|x {{=}} x + b}} concurrently, there is a [[race condition]]. They might both fetch {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;}} and operate on that, then both store their results with the effect that one overwrites the other and the stored value becomes either {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''}} or {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''}}, not {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a'' + ''b''}} as might be expected.

In [[uniprocessor]] systems with no [[kernel preemption]] supported, it is sufficient to disable [[interrupt]]s before accessing a [[critical section]].
However, in multiprocessor systems (even with interrupts disabled) two or more processors could be attempting to access the same memory at the same time. The fetch-and-add instruction allows any processor to atomically increment a value in memory, preventing such multiple processor collisions.

[[Maurice Herlihy]] (1991) proved that fetch-and-add has a finite [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]] number, in contrast to the [[compare-and-swap]] operation. The fetch-and-add operation can solve the wait-free consensus problem for no more than two concurrent processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herlihy |first=Maurice |title=Wait-free synchronization |journal=ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst. |volume=13 |issue=1 |date=January 1991 |pages=124–149 |url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy91/p124-herlihy.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-20 |doi=10.1145/114005.102808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The fetch-and-add instruction behaves like the following function. Crucially, the entire function is executed [[atomic (computer science)|atomically]]: no process can interrupt the function mid-execution and hence see a state that only exists during the execution of the function. This code only serves to help explain the behaviour of fetch-and-add; atomicity requires explicit hardware support and hence can not be implemented as a simple high level function.

 &lt;&lt; atomic &gt;&gt;
 '''function''' FetchAndAdd(''address'' location, ''int'' inc) {
     ''int'' value := *location
     *location := value + inc
     '''return''' value
 }

To implement a mutual exclusion lock, we define the operation FetchAndIncrement, which is equivalent to FetchAndAdd with inc=1.
With this operation, a mutual exclusion lock can be implemented using the [[ticket lock]] algorithm as:

  '''record''' locktype {
     ''int'' ticketnumber
     ''int'' turn
  }
  '''procedure''' LockInit( ''locktype''* lock ) {
     lock.ticketnumber := 0
     lock.turn := 0
  }
  '''procedure''' Lock( ''locktype''* lock ) {
     ''int'' myturn := FetchAndIncrement( &amp;lock.ticketnumber ) //must be atomic, since many threads might ask for a lock at the same time
     '''while''' lock.turn ≠ myturn 
         '''skip''' // ''spin until lock is acquired''
  }
  '''procedure''' UnLock( ''locktype''* lock ) {
     FetchAndIncrement( &amp;lock.turn ) //this need not be atomic, since only the possessor of the lock will execute this
  }

These routines provide a mutual-exclusion lock when following conditions are met:
*Locktype data structure is initialized with function LockInit before use
*Number of tasks waiting for the lock does not exceed INT_MAX at any time
*Integer datatype used in lock values can 'wrap around' when continuously incremented

==Hardware and software support==
An atomic {{mono|fetch_add}} function appears in the [[C++11]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=std::atomic::fetch_add |website=cppreference.com |url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available as a proprietary extension to [[C (programming language)|C]] in the [[Itanium]] [[Application binary interface|ABI]] specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel Itanium Processor-specific Application Binary Interface (ABI) |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]] |year=2001 |url=http://download.intel.com/design/itanium/downloads/245370.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with the same syntax) in [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atomic Builtins |website=Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) |publisher=Free Software Foundation |year=2005 |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===x86 implementation===
In the x86 architecture, the instruction ADD with the destination operand specifying a memory location is a fetch-and-add instruction that has been there since the [[8086]] (it just wasn't called that then), and with the LOCK prefix, is atomic across multiple processors. However, it could not return the original value of the memory location (though it returned some flags) until the [[80486|486]] introduced the XADD instruction.

The following is a [[C (programming language)|C]] implementation for the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler, for both 32 and 64 bit x86 Intel platforms, based on extended asm syntax:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  static inline int fetch_and_add(int* variable, int value)
  {
      __asm__ volatile("lock; xaddl %0, %1"
        : "+r" (value), "+m" (*variable) // input+output
        : // No input-only
        : "memory"
      );
      return value;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

===History===
fetch-and-add was introduced by the [[Ultracomputer]] project, which also produced a multiprocessor supporting fetch-and-add and containing custom vlsi switches that were able to combine concurrent memory references (including fetch-and-adds) to prevent them from serializing at the memory module containing the destination operand.

==Structure and data collected==

=== Questions ===

A FFQ includes questions on a set of food and beverage items. For each food or beverage item, there may be questions asking about the following:&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhanes-en&gt;{{cite web|url = http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/archive/usualintakes/FFQ.English.June0304.pdf|title = NHANES Food Questionnaire|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Frequency of consumption (with a "never" option as well as options ranging from very infrequent to several times a day).&lt;ref name=nhanes-en/&gt;
* Portion size information, which may be framed in terms of portion size for each round of consumption or total portion size. Respondents may be asked to translate usual consumption amount to number of specified units, such as a cup of rice. Some questionnaires include portion size images (such as photographs) in an attempt to enhance reporting [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;
* Other information, such as frequency of consumption at particular times of the year, or the subtype or brand that people consume.

In addition to foods and beverages, FFQs often ask about the frequency of intake and dosages of commonly consumed [[dietary supplements]].

=== Length and administration format ===

A FFQ that aims to capture total dietary intake includes questions on 80 to 120 food and beverage items, and takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

FFQs may be interviewer-administered in case of low literacy&lt;ref name=nci/&gt; as well as when being conducted on children.&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;

FFQs are intended for individual rather than household use (i.e., they need to be answered for each individual food consumer). For very young children, the FFQ may be answered by a parent or guardian instead.

=== Types of FFQs ===

FFQs are classified as:&lt;ref name=D/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/scotdietassessmethods.pdf|title = A short review of dietary assessment methods used in National and Scottish Research Studies|last = Wrieden|first = Wendy|last2 = Peace|first2 = Heather|last3 = Armstrong|first3 = Julie|last4 = Barton|first4 = Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Non-quantitative FFQs if they collect only frequency information, and no portion size information, and
* Semi-quantitative FFQs if they collect information on both frequency and portion size.

== Relation with other assessment tools ==

=== Similar diet assessment tools ===

FFQ is a common method for dietary assessment, i.e., for constructing the respondent's diet history. Some other methods include:&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;

* [[24-hour diet recall]]: This is a structured interview intended to capture detailed information about all the foods and beverages consumed by the respondent in the last 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/profiles/recall/|title = 24-hour Dietary Recall (24HR) At a Glance|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://medanth.wikispaces.com/24-hour+diet+recall|title = 24-hour diet recall|publisher = Medanth|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the parent or guardian may respond on the child's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Development and Pilot Testing of 24-Hour Multiple-Pass Recall to Assess Dietary Intake of Toddlers of Somali- and Iraqi-Born Mothers Living in Norway|journal = Nutrients|doi = 10.3390/nu6062333|pmc=4073154|pmid=24949548|volume=6|year=2014|pages=2333–47 | last1 = Grewal | first1 = NK | last2 = Mosdøl | first2 = A | last3 = Aunan | first3 = MB | last4 = Monsen | first4 = C | last5 = Torheim | first5 = LE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this method is the multiple-pass recall. Here, after an initial recall, the interviewer goes back to previous questions to clarify further details.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;
* Other kinds of diet history interviews, such as narrative diet histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S0002-8223(00)00237-6/abstract|title = Applying Conversation Analysis to Foster Accurate Reporting in the Diet History Interview|last = Tapsell|first = Linda Clare|last2 = Brenninger|first2 = Vanessa|last3 = Barnard|first3 = Janelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weighted food diary (also called weighted food record): The individual records details of food and beverage in the diary at the time of consumption.&lt;ref name=weighted-food-diary&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/dietary-assessment/methods/weighed-food-diary/indication.php|title = Dietary assessment - Weighed food diary|publisher = Medical Research Council|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this method is estimated food records, where the quantification of food and drink is estimated rather than weighed.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to weighted food records ===

FFQs, as well as other retrospective diet assessment methods (such as the 24-hour diet recall and other diet history methods) have the advantage that they do not directly affect the behavior of the respondent. In contrast, weighted food records may influence the participant's eating behavior. Weighted food records also carry a high respondent burden.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

One disadvantage of FFQs and other retrospective methods is that they may be less accurate because participants are relying on memory rather than information recorded in real time.

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to the 24-hour diet recall ===

FFQs have the following advantages:

* They can better capture consumption of foods consumed occasionally or episodically than the 24-hour diet recall. For instance, if people habitually consume alcohol more on Fridays, then a 24-hour diet recall conducted on Tuesday will underestimate the extent of alcohol consumption, whereas a well-designed FFQ can capture the information.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=D/&gt;
* They are easier to administer to literate populations at large scale and also easier to process than diet recalls.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

FFQs have many disadvantages:

* Due to the longer time period involved, FFQs are more dependent on people having good memory as well as being able to accurately estimate the frequency of rare events (for instance, being able to correctly judge whether they consume something once a month or once a week). These are cognitively complex tasks that require good generic memory.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt; 
* FFQs lack detailed information on how the food was prepared as well as information on exactly how much was consumed and when. 
* Since FFQs are limited to a fixed list of foods, they may not capture eating patterns of people who have very different eating patterns.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=D/&gt; 
* FFQs are more subject (than diet recalls) to [[social desirability bias]], with people over-reporting the extent of consumption of "healthy" foods such as fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

=== Validation of FFQs using other methods ===

Due to some of the concerns surrounding the validity and reliability of FFQs, research using a FFQ generally also tests the validity of the FFQ. In a typical research design, the FFQ is validated against another dietary assessment technique (such as 24-hour diet recall or weighted food records) on a small population.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=pregnancy-pufa-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=north-sweden-ffq&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 12003662|title = Validation and calibration of food-frequency questionnaire measurements in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease cohort|journal = [[Public Health Nutrition]] | doi=10.1079/PHNPHN2001315|volume=5|year=2002|pages=487–96 | last1 = Johansson | first1 = I | last2 = Hallmans | first2 = G | last3 = Wikman | first3 = A | last4 = Biessy | first4 = C | last5 = Riboli | first5 = E | last6 = Kaaks | first6 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once validated, the FFQ can be distributed to a wider population with the same characteristics. The need to validate FFQs against diet recalls or other more reliable methods is a recurrent theme in research and guidance on FFQs.&lt;ref name=nci-principles/&gt;

==Food frequency questionnaires in use==

=== Specificity to populations ===

Since FFQs list specific food and beverage items, a FFQ designed for and validated against one population is not valid for other populations. Therefore, FFQs must be appropriately modified and revalidated against new populations.&lt;ref name=sri-lanka-ffq&gt;{{cite journal|title = Validity of a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutritional intake among Sri Lankan adults|last = Jayawardena|first = Ranil|last2 = Byrne|first2 = Nuala|last3 = Soares|first3 = Mario|last4 = Katulanda|first4 = Prasad|last5 = Hills|first5 = Andrew|pmc=4766149|pmid=27026859|doi=10.1186/s40064-016-1837-x|volume=5|year=2016|journal=SpringerPlus|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few key challenges include:

* Different populations consume different sets of foods and beverages, so the list of items in a FFQ validated against one population may not cover all the items for the other population.
* Even when the items match in name, the methods of preparation may differ significantly enough that results from one FFQ may not be applicable to a different FFQ.
* Different populations use different languages, so the FFQ needs to be translated. Even when populations use the same language (e.g., two English-speaking countries) the jargon for specific food items can differ. Thus, for instance, in order to administer the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ II) in Canada, a Canadian version, C-DHQ-II, was created.&lt;ref name=cdhq2/&gt;

A number of standard FFQs are available for adults in the United States.&lt;ref name=D/&gt; There is also research based on FFQs in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt; although weighted food records are more common there.&lt;ref name=weighted-food-diary/&gt; FFQs have also been developed in [[Sweden]] and other Northern and Western European countries.&lt;ref name=north-sweden-ffq/&gt; There has been some research on FFQs in other regions, such as the Middle East and Mediterranean,&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/&gt; [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref name=sri-lanka-ffq/&gt; and [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v58/n1/full/1601738a.html|pmid = 14679362|title = Validity and reproducibility of the food frequency questionnaire used in the Shanghai Women's Health Study|last = Shu|first = XO|last2 = Yang|first2 = G|last3 = Jin|first3 = F|last4 = Kushi|first4 = L|last5 = Wen|first5 = W|last6 = Gao|first6 = YT|last7 = Zheng|first7 = W|journal = [[European Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|year = 2004|volume = 58|issue = 1|pages = 17–23|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis of data ==

=== Calculation of nutrient intake (for semi-quantitative FFQs) ===

Calculations for nutrient intake can be estimated via computerized [[software]] programs that multiply the reported frequency of each food by the amount of nutrient in a serving of that food. References databases commonly used for this purpose are listed below. Note that to estimate total nutrient intake, it is necessary to include dietary supplements in the FFQ and add the nutrient intake from these, particularly when dealing with populations where the consumption of dietary supplements is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/learn/questionnaire-screeners.html|title=Food Composition Databases for Food Frequency Questionnaires and Screeners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), which in turn is based on the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]]. To incorporate the effect of dietary supplements, the USDA Dietary Supplement Integrated Database (DSID) can be used.&lt;ref name=usda-fnd-infra&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/JN_FoodNutrDB.pdf|title = USDA Food and Nutrient Databases Provide the Infrastructure for Food and Nutrient Research, Policy, and Practice|last = Ahuja|first = Jaspreet|last2 = Moshfegh|first2 = Alanna|last3 = Holden|first3 = Joanne|last4 = Harris|first4 = Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Minnesota]] Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC)'s Food and Nutrient Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ncc.umn.edu/food-and-nutrient-database/|title = Food and Nutrient Database|publisher = Nutrition Coordinating Center, [[University of Minnesota]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-quantitative FFQs, nutrient intake cannot be calculated as accurately, but the FFQ can still be used to get a rough idea of nutrient consumption.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

=== Calculation of food groups consumed ===

A related use of FFQs is to determine how much people consume broad groups of foods. Examples of such food groups are fruits, vegetables, and added sugars. A useful database for this purpose is the USDA's Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED).&lt;ref name=usda-fnd-infra/&gt;

=== Comparison data ===

In the [[United States]], data from NHANES is used to provide nationwide comparison data.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/ctrc/Nutrition/Documents/Food_Frequency_Questionnaires.pdf|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[University of Colorado Denver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population-level analyses ===

FFQs can be used for a variety of population-level analyses:

* Estimation of total consumption of specific foods, food groups, and nutrients in a population.
* Estimation of the correlation between patterns of food consumption and other non-diet variables, such as health status or specific medical conditions.
* Estimation of the effectiveness of interventions to change diet. In this experimental design, both the experiment subjects and the control group are asked to fill in the FFQ before and after the intervention, and changes in food consumption patterns for the experimental group are measured. However, because of concern about potential differential response bias due to the tendency of the intervention group to misreport their diets to a greater extent than the control group, use of an FFQ (or any self-report dietary instrument) as the sole evaluation method should be carefully considered.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

== Criticism ==

The low validity of FFQs has made them a subject of criticism. Walter Willett, developer of the Harvard FFQ, estimated a correlation of 0.60 to 0.70 between standard FFQs and diet recalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1100.full|last=Willett|first=Walter|authorlink = Walter Willett|title=Invited Commentary: A Further Look at Dietary Questionnaire Validation|journal = [[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|volume = 154|issue = 12|pages=1100–1102|doi=10.1093/aje/154.12.1100|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan R. Kristal, Ulrike Peters and John D. Potter wrote in their article "Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?" that there was not much scope to learn more from FFQs, and that a more curious and exploratory approach was needed to uncover new insights on diet and its correlation with health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/12/2826.short|last = Kristal|first = Alan R.|last2 = Peters|first2 = Ulrike|last3 = Potter|first3 = John D.|title=Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?|doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-ED1|publisher = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|volume = 14|issue = 12|date = December 1, 2005|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|pages=2826–2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Cancer Institute has argued that through careful bias correction, some of the limitations of FFQs can be overcome, and they can be very useful.&lt;ref name=nci-principles&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and recommendations from NCI|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/approach/principles.html|publisher=[[NIH]]|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''IC2MP''' (Institute of Chemistry of Poitiers : Materials and Natural Resources) is a multidisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Poitiers]] ([[France]]) and the [[CNRS]].

== Présentation ==

The '''IC2MP''' is a research laboratory mainly in chemistry and geology. It was created on January 1, 2012, which fields of expertise include the study of materials (clay, catalysts,..), natural environments (waters, soils,..) and the reactions (natural or caused). The major application fields relate to catalysis, synthesis, decontamination, use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gecat.fr/spip.php?site5 Gecat official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IC2MP was born from the merger of four laboratories of Poitiers University (SFA and [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSI Poitiers]])&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.univ-poitiers.fr/recherche/laboratoires/institut-de-chimie-des-milieux-et-des-materiaux-de-poitiers-ic2mp-umr-7285-9826.kjsp?RH=1328803971990], description of the laboratory, University of Poitiers&lt;/ref&gt; and CNRS&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002050341/http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}, description of IC2MP by CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; located on the university campus of Poitiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp HYDRASA et LCME-Poitiers fusionnent et deviennent IC2MP] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708064255/http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp |date=2012-07-08 }}, CARTEAU - Office national de l'eau et des milieux aquatiques&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific team « Water, organic geochemistry, health », with the [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSIP]] and the [http://apten.asso.univ-poitiers.fr APTEN], are the initiators of the ‘Water Information Day’ (the [[Journées Information Eaux]]), a bi-annual event which occurs around the opening of the academic year.

== Some research works ==

* In 2008, the discovery of more than 250 well-preserved fossils in Gabon brought, for the first time, the proof of the existence of pluricellular organisms which lived 2.1 billion years ago, a crucial advance in the understanding of the origin of life. So far, the first forms of complex life (with multiple cells) previously found were dated back 600 million years.  These works were published in 2010 in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100630/full/news.2010.323.html Ancient macrofossils unearthed in West Africa], ''Nature'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This major and unexpected discovery, conducted by the team of Professor [[Abderrazak El Albani]] gave birth to a cross-disciplinary research project within the IC2MP Institute aiming at studying organic and primitive materials and Paleo-environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1753.htm CNRS Article 30 June 2010 Discovery of a complex, multicellular life from over two billion years ago]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cancer: a new therapeutic molecule which attacks only the tumourous cells. In 2012, a study led by the researchers of the IC2MP, supported by the Cancéropôle Grand Ouest, resulted in the finalization of the therapeutic targeting  system, which is programmed to transport a powerful anti-cancer agent through the tumorous cells, without affecting the healthy tissue usually damaged by classical therapies. The validity of this concept was demonstrated on mouses, in the context of the treatment of a solid tumor. This study, which represents a new hope in the fight against cancer, has been published in the international edition of  [[Angewandte Chemie]] as a “Very Important Paper” (VIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.201204935 | volume=51 | title=The First Generation of β-Galactosidase-Responsive Prodrugs Designed for the Selective Treatment of Solid Tumors in Prodrug Monotherapy | year=2012 | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition | pages=11606–11610 | last1 = Legigan | first1 = Thibaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was directed by Sébastien Papot, lecturer at University of Poitiers and leader of the Research Group “[http://smp.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/ Programmed Molecular Systems]”, part of the research team Organic Synthesis.

'''Landscape limnology''' is the spatially explicit study of [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s as they interact with freshwater, terrestrial, and human [[landscape]]s to determine the effects of pattern on [[ecosystem]] processes across temporal and spatial scales. [[Limnology]] is the study of inland water bodies inclusive of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; landscape limnology seeks to integrate all of these ecosystem types.

The [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] component represents spatial hierarchies of landscape features that influence which materials, whether solutes or organisms, are transported to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems; aquatic connections represent how these materials are transported; and human activities reflect features that influence how these materials are transported as well as their quantity and temporal dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.E. Webster, K.S. Cheruvelil and M.T. Bremigan. 2009. The lake landscape-context framework: linking aquatic connections, terrestrial features and human effects at multiple spatial scales. Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie. 30:695-700&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The core principles or themes of [[landscape ecology]] provide the foundation for landscape limnology. These ideas can be synthesized into a set of four landscape ecology themes that are broadly applicable to any aquatic ecosystem type, and that consider the unique features of such ecosystems. 

'''A landscape limnology framework begins with the premise of Thienemann (1925). Wiens (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 2002. Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water. Freshwater Biology 47:501-515&lt;/ref&gt; freshwater ecosystems can be considered patches.''' As such, the location of these patches and their placement relative to other elements of the landscape is important to the ecosystems and their processes. Therefore, the four main themes of landscape limnology are:

'''(1) Patch characteristics:''' The characteristics of a freshwater ecosystem include its physical morphometry, chemical, and biological features, as well as its boundaries. These boundaries are often more easily defined for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., shoreline, [[riparian zone]]s, and emergent vegetation zone) and are often a focal-point for important ecosystem processes linking terrestrial and aquatic components.

'''(2) Patch context:''' The freshwater ecosystem is embedded in a complex terrestrial mosaic (e.g., soils, geology, and land use/cover) that has been shown to drive many within-ecosystem features and processes such as water chemistry, species richness, and primary and secondary productivity. 

'''(3) Patch connectivity and directionality:''' The complex freshwater mosaic is connected to the particular patch of interest and defines the degree to which materials and organisms move across the landscape through freshwater connections. For freshwater ecosystems, these connections often display a strong directionality component that must be explicitly considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, G.W., G.W. Kipphut, M.M. Miller, and J. O’Briens. 2000. Integration of lakes and streams in a landscape perspective: the importance of material processing on spatial patterns and temporal coherence. Freshwater Biology 43: 477-497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcarelli, A.M. and W.A. Wurtsbaugh. 2007. Effects of upstream lakes and nutrient limitation on periphytic biomass and nitrogen fixation in Oligotrophic, subalpine streams. Freshwater Biology 52:2211-2225&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a specific wetland can be connected through groundwater to other wetlands or lakes, or through surface water connections directly to lakes and rivers, or both, and the directionality of those connections will strongly impact the movement of nutrients and biota.

'''(4) Spatial scale and hierarchy:''' Interactions among terrestrial and freshwater elements occur at multiple spatial scales that must be considered hierarchically. The explicit integration of hierarchy into landscape limnology is important because (a) many freshwater ecosystems are hierarchically organized and controlled by processes that are hierarchically organized,&lt;ref&gt;Frissell, C.A., W.J. Liss, C.E. Warren &amp; M.D. Hurley. 1986. A hierarchical framework for stream habitat classification: viewing streams in a watershed context. Environmental Management 10: 199–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"&gt;Tonn, W.M. 1990. Climate change and fish communities: A conceptual framework. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:337-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poff, N.L. 1997. Landscape filters and species traits: towards mechanistic understanding and prediction in stream ecology. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 16: 391–409&lt;/ref&gt; (b) most freshwater ecosystems are managed at multiple spatial scales, from policy set at the national level, to land management conducted at local scales, and (c) the degree of homogeneity among freshwater ecosystems can change in relation to the scale of observation.

==Contributions to other fields==

Findings from landscape limnology research are contributing to many facets of aquatic ecosystem research, management, and conservation.  Landscape limnology is especially relevant for geographical areas with thousands of ecosystems (i.e. lake-rich regions of the world), in situations with a range of human disturbances, or when considering lakes, streams, and wetlands that are connected to other such ecosystems. For example, landscape limnology perspectives have contributed to the development of nutrient criteria for lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.S. Cheruvelil, R.J. Stevenson, S.L. Rollins, S.W. Holden, S. Heaton, and E.K. Torng. 2008. A framework for developing ecosystem-specific nutrient criteria: Integrating biological thresholds with predictive modeling. Limnology and Oceanography 53(2): 773-787&lt;/ref&gt; formation of classification systems that can be used to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Cheruvelil, K.S., P.A. Soranno, M.T. Bremigan, T. Wagner, and S.L. Martin. 2008. Grouping lakes for water quality assessment and monitoring: the roles of regionalization and spatial scale. Environmental Management. 41:425-440&lt;/ref&gt; understanding ecosystem responses to environmental stressors,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. A., A.T. Herlihy, P.R. Kaufmann, and J.M. Eilers. 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">'''Narcotizing dysfunction''' is a theory that as [[mass media]] inundates people on a particular issue, they become apathetic to it, substituting knowledge for action.&lt;ref&gt;Baran ''et al.'' pp.179-80 quotation: {{quotation|one of the first media effects to be studied in some depth using functional analysis was the '''narcotizing dysfunction''', the idea that as news about an issue inundates people, they become apathetic to it... These findings were disturbing because they suggested that even when media are effective at surveying the environment and calling attention to societal problems (a manifest function), ... media coverage might "[[narcotics|narcotize]]" [the public] so that they become apathetic and decide that they are powerless to do anything (a latent dysfunction).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the vast supply of communications Americans receive may elicit only a superficial concern with the problems of society. This would result in real societal action being neglected, while superficiality covers up mass [[apathy]]. Thus, it is termed "[[wikt:dysfunctional|dysfunctional]]" as it indicates the inherent dysfunction of both [[mass media]] and [[social media]] during controversial incidents and events. The theory assumes that it is not in the best interests of people to form a social mass that is politically apathetic and inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir |url=https://asosindex.com/cache/articles/sosyal-medyanin-uyusturan-etkisi-f187234.pdf|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|date=April 2016|department=Rethinking the Contributions of Social Media to Democracy and Social Movements|journal=Cankiri Karatekin University Journal of Institute of Social Sciences|format=PDF|volume=7 |issue=1|page=1023|id=ASOS f187234|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=...social media can act against political participation &amp; grass roots mobilization because social media &amp; other internet based technologies "discourage face-to-face communication"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irfanerdogan.com/dergiweb2008/24/13.pdf| title=Mass communication, popular taste, and organized social action|vauthors=Lazarsfeld PF, Merton RK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''narcotizing dysfunction'' was identified in the article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action'', by [[Paul F.

Mass media's overwhelming flow of information has caused the populace to become passive in their social activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir|date=2016-04-01|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301685342_Narcotizing_Effect_of_Social_Media|journal=Çankırı Karatekin Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the individual is assailed with information about a huge range of issues and problems and they are knowledgeable about or able to discuss these issues, they believe they are helping to resolve these issues. As more time is spent educating oneself on current issues, there is a decrease in time available to take organized social action. Courses of action may be discussed, but they are rather internalized and rarely come to fruition. In short, people have unwittingly substituted knowledge for action.&lt;ref name="M+L-1957" /&gt; People's consciences are clear, as they think they have done something to address the issue. However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, [[political participation]] continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKKzMtuS2EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=gx1KP6lvC2&amp;dq=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;f=false|title=MediaWriting: Print, Broadcast, and Public Relations|first1=Rik|last1=Whitaker|first2=Janet|last2=Ramsey|first3=Ronald D.|last3=Smith|date=19 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203886700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term &lt;i&gt;narcotizing dysfunction&lt;/i&gt; gained popularity from its use in the 1948 article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action'', by Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton. In Lazarsfeld and Merton's article, it appears as the third function of mass media's problematic social effects, alongside social status conferral function and the enforcement of social norms.

The '''National Intelligence University''' (NIU), formerly known as the '''National Defense Intelligence College''' and the '''Joint Military Intelligence College''', is a federally-chartered research university in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. NIU is the [[United States Intelligence Community|United States Intelligence Community's]] (IC) institution for higher learning in fields of study central to the profession of intelligence and national security. NIU awards undergraduate and graduate degrees, graduate certificates, and research fellowships to prepare personnel for senior positions in the IC and the broader national security enterprise. Since 1963, more than 80,000 military and civilian students have attended the university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.ni-u.edu/news/NIU_Graduates_Largest_Number_2012.html&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly located at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], NIU's primary campus is now located at [[Intelligence Community Campus-Bethesda]] (ICC-B) with five additional locations around the world. The university's [[John T. Hughes Library]] is also located at ICC-B. NIU is the only university in the [[United States]] where students can study and complete research at the [[Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] level.

National Intelligence University's [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] programs emphasize education through scholarly and applied research designed to help U.S. intelligence officers better understand the diverse range of geopolitical, strategic, and technological threats and opportunities affecting intelligence and national security. The university is organized into two separate academic units: the [[College of Strategic Intelligence]] and the [[Oettinger School of Science and Technology]]. Combined, the colleges cover a diverse and evolving range of international affairs issues and adversarial threats and capabilities, from cultural and religious conflicts to [[weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] proliferation, [[cybersecurity]] threats, [[terrorism]], [[transnational crime]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ni-u.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2017-18_Catalog_v.2.pdf|title=National Intelligence University 2017-2017 Catalog|last=|first=|date=Aug 2017|website=NIU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressionally chartered and publicly-funded but with admissions restricted solely to current U.S. [[Intelligence officer]]s holding a [[Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] clearance, NIU is a small, non-resident university. Admissions are highly selective, but tuition is paid by the [[United States Government]].

==History==
The [[United States Department of Defense]] established the Defense Intelligence School in 1962 to consolidate existing [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] academic programs in strategic intelligence. In 1980, the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the school to award the Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence degree. In 1981, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the School. That same year, DoD rechartered the institution as the Defense Intelligence College, placing additional emphasis on its research mission.

Since then, the university has added several off-campus programs at the [[National Security Agency]], the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], and several regional centers and has encouraged an increase in enrollment from civilian agencies. On campus, it has also added two part-time graduate programs, one designed for military reservists. Students from throughout the Intelligence Community attend the university, and they include active duty and reserve military personnel from each of the services (including the Coast Guard), DoD, and other federal civilian employees.

Renamed the Joint Military Intelligence College in 1993, it educates the future leaders of the Intelligence Community by offering an undergraduate and graduate curriculum. In addition, the university sponsors research and publication opportunities for students and faculty, attracts distinguished speakers, and its students participate in field exercises and simulations in partnership with their peers at the military staff and war colleges.

==Vision and mission==
LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]], USA, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, addressed NIU graduates, their families and guests at the 2012 graduation by stating, "Our vision—that NIU becomes the center of academic life for the intelligence community—will help shape graduates who address the range of mission challenges as a fully integrated community, and encourage lifelong learning as they continue to serve this nation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NIU is an accredited federal degree granting institution educating and preparing intelligence officers to meet current and future challenges to the national security of the United States. NIU President Dr. David Ellison stressed in his 2012 graduation remarks that NIU addresses these challenges by helping students develop "depth in critical thinking" and "breadth in understanding the IC" and how focused research applies to analysis and addressing critical questions on national security.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Educational accreditation==
The university is authorized by the [[United States Congress]] to award the Bachelor of Science in Intelligence, the Master of Science and Technology Intelligence and the Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence degrees. The university is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools|Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

==Facilities and resources==
The John T. Hughes Library houses 2.5 million items, including books, unclassified intelligence documents, reference materials, periodicals, microfilms, video and cartographic items. The library subscribes to 2,000 international periodicals, newspapers, annuals, serials, and statistical reports. It is particularly strong in [[Russia]]n periodicals. The library has archival microfiche and microfilm collections of general and scholarly periodicals, [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] reports, and declassified documents.

The Office of Research within the university enables students to pursue projects that require research outside the Washington, DC, area, including overseas. The university encourages faculty research on intelligence issues and supports intelligence-related research by faculty from other DoD Schools. Faculty and student research is published in academic journals, in the university's Occasional Paper series, and in book-length special studies. Research results and thesis abstracts are also disseminated electronically to the Intelligence Community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="108917">A '''nerve guidance conduit''' (also referred to as an '''artificial nerve conduit''' or '''artificial nerve graft''', as opposed to an [[autograft]]) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate [[nerve regeneration]] and is one of several clinical treatments for [[Nerve injury|nerve injuries]]. When direct [[surgical suture|suturing]] of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerve]] injuries is autologous nerve [[Medical grafting|grafting]]. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, [[neural tissue engineering]] research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the [[central nervous system]] poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-2003-ARBE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schmidt | first = C.

The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2005-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = J.

Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from [[silicone]] and [[polyglycolide]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Battiston-2005-Microsurgery"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Battiston | first = B. | author2 = Geuna, S.; Ferrero, M. &amp; Tos, P. | year = 2005 | title = Nerve repair by means of tubulization: literature review and personal clinical experience comparing biological and synthetic conduits for sensory nerve repair | journal = Microsurgery | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 258–267 | doi = 10.1002/micr.20127 | pmid = 15934044 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, [[neurotrophic factor]]s and [[Bionics|biomimetic]] materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration.

== Scaffold topography ==
.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Norman | first = J. J. |author2=Desai, T. A. |date=January 2006 | title = Methods for fabrication of nanoscale topography for tissue engineering scaffolds | journal = Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–101 | pmid = 16525765 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s10439-005-9005-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tissue engineering]], the three main levels of scaffold structure are considered to be:&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;
* the superstructure, the overall shape of the scaffold;
* the microstructure, the cellular level structure of the surface; and
* the nanostructure, the subcellular level structure of the surface.

=== Superstructure ===
The superstructure of a conduit or scaffold is important for simulating ''in vivo'' conditions for nerve tissue formation. The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules. Ways of forming artificial superstructure include the use of thermo-responsive hydrogels, longitudinally oriented channels, longitudinally oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous scaffolds.

==== Thermo-responsive hydrogels ====
In [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), a series of damaging events is initiated that lead to cell death and overall dysfunction, which cause the formation of an irregularly-shaped lesion cavity.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stabenfeldt| first = S. E. | author2 = García, A. J. and LaPlaca, M. C. |date=June 2006 | title = Thermoreversible laminin-functionalized hydrogel for neural tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 718–725 | doi = 10.1002/jbm.a.30638 | pmid = 16555267 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting cavity causes many problems for tissue-engineered scaffolds because invasive implantation is required, and often the scaffold does not conform to the cavity shape. In order to get around these difficulties, thermo-responsive [[hydrogels]] have been engineered to undergo solution-gelation (sol-gel) transitions, which are caused by differences in room and physiological temperatures, to facilitate implantation through in situ gelation and conformation to cavity shape caused, allowing them to be injected in a minimally invasively manner.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt;

[[Methylcellulose]] (MC) is a material with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs because of an increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in ''in vivo'' applications.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies.&lt;ref name="Stabenfeldt-2006-JBMR"/&gt; Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.

Another thermo-responsive gel is one that is formed by combining [[chitosan]] with glycerophosphate (GP) salt.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crompton| first = K. E. |author2=Goud, J. D. |author3=Bellamkonda, R. V. |author4=Gengenbach, T. R. |author5=Finkelstein, D. I. |author6= Horne, M. K. and Forsythe, J. S.  |date=January 2007 | title = Polylysine-functionalised thermoresponsive chitosan hydrogel for neural tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 441–449 | pmid = 16978692 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.08.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution experiences gelation at temperatures above 37&amp;nbsp;°C. Gelation of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking half an hour to initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success ''in vitro'', but the addition of [[Poly-lysine|polylysine]] is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes [[neurite]] growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though neurite outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Longitudinally oriented channels ====
Longitudinally oriented channels are macroscopic structures that can be added to a conduit in order to give the regenerating axons a well-defined guide for growing straight along the scaffold. In a scaffold with microtubular channel architecture, regenerating axons are able to extend through open longitudinal channels as they would normally extend through endoneurial tubes of peripheral nerves.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wang | first = A. |author2=Ao, Q. |author3=Cao, W. |author4=Yu, M. |author5=He, Q. |author6=Kong, L. |author7=Zhang, L. |author8= Gong, Y. and Zhang, X.  |date=October 2006 | title = Porous chitosan tubular scaffolds with knitted outer wall and controllable inner structure for nerve tissue engineering | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–46 | pmid = 16758450 | url = | doi = 10.1002/jbm.a.30683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the channels increase the surface area available for cell contact. The channels are usually created by inserting a needle, wire, or second polymer solution within a polymer scaffold; after stabilizing the shape of the main polymer, the needle, wire, or second polymer is removed in order to form the channels. Typically multiple channels are created; however, the scaffold can consist of just one large channel, which is simply one hollow tube.

A molding technique was created by Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an outer tube wall from chitosan.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"/&gt; In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow chitosan tube, where they are held in place by fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A chitosan solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the inner diameter of the outer tube wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through the entire length of the scaffold. Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of the scaffold became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining the scaffold shape that guides neurite extension. The inner structure provides an increase in compressive strength compared to a hollow tube alone, which can prevent collapse of the scaffold onto growing neurites. Neuro-2a cells were able to growth on the inner matrix of the scaffold, and they oriented along the channels. Although this method has only been tested on chitosan, it can be tailored to other materials.&lt;ref name="Wang-2006-JBMR"/&gt;

[[Lyophilization|lyophilizing]] and wire-heating process is another method of creating longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005).&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huang | first = Y. C. | author2 = Huang, Y. Y.; Huang, C. C. and Liu, H. C. |date=July 2005 | title = Manufacture of porous polymer nerve conduits through a lyophilizing and wire-heating process | journal = Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 659–664 | doi = 10.1002/jbm.b.30267 | pmid = 15909301 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A chitosan and [[acetic acid]] solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a [[liquid nitrogen]] trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen because they have a high resistance level. Temperature-controlled lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After lyophilizing, scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt;

Another way to create longitudinally oriented channels is to create a conduit from one polymer with embedded longitudinally oriented fibers from another polymer; then selectively dissolve the fibers to form longitudinally oriented channels. [[Polycaprolactone]] (PCL) fibers were embedded in a [[(Hydroxyethyl)methacrylate]] (HEMA) scaffold. PCL was chosen over poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), because it is insoluble in HEMA but soluble in [[acetone]]. This is important because HEMA was used for the main conduit material and acetone was used to selectively dissolve the polymer fibers. Extruded PCL fibers were inserted into a glass tube and the HEMA solution was injected. The number of channels created was consistent from batch to batch and the variations in fiber diameter could be reduced by creating a more controlled PCL fiber extrusion system.&lt;ref name="Flynn-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flynn | first = L. | author2 = Dalton, P. D. and Shoichet, M. S. |date=October 2003 | title = Fiber templating of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) for neural tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 23 | pages = 4265–4272 | pmid = 12853258 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00334-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The channels formed were confirmed to be continuous and homogeneous by examination of porosity variations. This process is safe, reproducible and has controllable dimensions.&lt;ref name="Flynn-2003-Biomaterials"/&gt; In a similar study conducted by Yu and Shoichet (2005), HEMA was copolymerized with AEMA to create a P(HEMA-co-AMEA) gel. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in the gel, and then selectively dissolved by acetone with sonication to create channels. It was found that HEMA in mixture with 1% AEMA created the strongest gels.&lt;ref name="Yu-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yu | first = T. T. |author2=Shoichet, M. S. |date=May 2005 | title = Guided cell adhesion and outgrowth in peptide-modified channels for neural tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 13 | pages = 1507–1514 | pmid = 15522752 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.05.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to scaffolds without channels, the addition of 82–132 channels can provide an approximately 6–9 fold increase in surface area, which may be advantageous for regeneration studies that depend on contact-mediated cues.&lt;ref name="Yu-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

Itoh et al. (2003) developed a scaffold consisting of a single large longitudinally oriented channel was created using chitosan tendons from crabs.&lt;ref name="Itoh-2003-AO"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Itoh | first = S. |author2=Suzuki, M. |author3=Yamaguchi, I. |author4=Takakuda, K. |author5=Kobayashi, H. |author6= Shinomiya, K. and Tanaka, J.  |date=December 2003 | title = Development of a nerve scaffold using a tendon chitosan tube | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 1079–1088 | pmid = 14678421 | url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2003.07208.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendons were harvested from crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi) and repeatedly washed with sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins and to deacetylate the tendon [[chitin]], which subsequently became known as tendon chitosan. A stainless steel bar with triangular-shaped cross-section (each side 2.1&amp;nbsp;mm long) was inserted into a hollow tendon chitosan tube of circular-shaped cross-section (diameter: 2&amp;nbsp;mm; length: 15&amp;nbsp;mm). When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, it was found that the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available.&lt;ref name="Itoh-2003-AO"/&gt; While this is an effective method for creating a single channel, it does not provide as much surface area for cellular growth as the multi-channel scaffolds.

Newman et al. (2006) inserted conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a [[terpolymer]] of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping them on a small glass slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800&amp;nbsp;µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and [[Kevlar]], and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers and to some extent along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newman | first = K.

In their 2005 study, Cai et al. added Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microfilaments to hollow [[poly(lactic acid)]] (PLA) and silicon tubes. The microfiber guidance characteristics were inversely related to the fiber diameter with smaller diameters promoting better longitudinally oriented cell migration and axonal regeneration. The microfibers also promoted myelination during peripheral nerve repair.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cai | first = J. | author2 = Peng, X.; Nelson, K.

==== Stretch-grown axons ====
Mature axon tracts has been demonstrated to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pfister | first = B.

There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"/&gt; Examination by [[scanning electron microscope]] and [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] showed no signs of axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1&amp;nbsp;cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1&amp;nbsp;mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1&amp;nbsp;mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2007-Neurosurgery"/&gt;

==== Nanofibers scaffolds ====
Research on nanoscale fibers attempts to mimic the in vivo extracellular environment in order to promote directional growth and regeneration.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Three distinct methods for forming nanofibrous scaffolds are self-assembly, phase separation and electrospinning. However, there are many other methods for forming nanofibrous scaffolds.

Self-assembly of nanofibrous scaffolds is able to occur only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly is able to create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' a self-aligned [[collagen]]-[[Schwann cell]] matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment ''in vitro''. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional [[tissue culture]]. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2005-TE"/&gt; Soluble plasma [[fibronectin]] can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2004-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = J. B. | author2 = King, V. R.; Ward, Z.; Porter, R. A.; Priestley, J. V. &amp; Brown, R. A. |date=June 2004 | title = Fluid shear in viscous fibronectin gels allows aggregation of fibrous materials for CNS tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2769–2779 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.09.052 | pmid = 14962555 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3&amp;nbsp;cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.&lt;ref name="Phillips-2004-Biomaterials"/&gt;

Phase separation allows for three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds to be created without the use of specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

[[Electrospinning]] provides a robust platform for development of synthetic nerve guidance conduits. Electrospinning can serve to create scaffolds at controlled dimensions with varying chemistry and topography. Furthermore, different materials can be encapsulated within fibers including particles, growth factors, and even cells.&lt;ref name="Xu-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Xiaoyun | author2 = Woon-Chee Yee, Peter Y.K Hwang, Hanry Yu, Andrew C.A Wan, Shujun Gao, Kum-Loong Boon, Hai-Quan Mao, Kam W Leong &amp; Shu Wang|date=June 2003 | title = Peripheral nerve regeneration with sustained release of poly(phosphoester) microencapsulated nerve growth factor within nerve guide conduits| journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 13 | pages = 2405–2412| doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00109-1| pmid = 12699678 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrospinning creates fibers by electrically charging a droplet of polymer melt or solution and suspending it from a capillary. Then, an electric field is applied at one end of the capillary until the charge exceeds the surface tension, creating a polymer jet that elongates and thins. This polymer jet discharges as a Taylor cone, leaving behind electrically charged polymers, which are collected on a grounded surface as the solvent as the solvent evaporates from the jets.&lt;ref name="Christopherson-2009-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Christopherson | first = Gregory | author2 = Hongjun Song &amp; Hai-Quan Mao |date=February 2009 | title = The influence of fiber diameter of electrospun substrates on neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation| journal = Biomaterials | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 556–564 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.10.004| pmid = 18977025 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fibers have been spun with diameters ranging from less than 3&amp;nbsp;nm to over 1&amp;nbsp;µm.

(2005), aligned and random electrospun poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microfibrous and nanofibrous scaffolds were created, characterized, and compared. Fiber diameters were directly proportional to the initial polymer concentration used for electrospinning; the average diameter of aligned fibers was smaller than that of random fibers under identical processing conditions. It was shown that neural stem cells elongated parallel to the aligned electrospun fibers.&lt;ref name="Yang-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; The aligned nanofibers had a longer average neurite length compared to aligned microfibers, random microfibers, and random nanofibers. In addition, more cells differentiated on aligned nanofibers than aligned microfibers.&lt;ref name="Yang-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus, the results of this study demonstrated that aligned nanofibers may be more beneficial than nonaligned fibers or microfibers for promoting nerve regeneration.

=== Microstructure and nanostructure ===
Microstructure and nanostructure, along with superstructure are three main levels of scaffold structure that deserve consideration when creating scaffold topography.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; While the superstructure refers to the overall shape of the scaffold, the microstructure refers to the cellular level structure of the surface and the nanostructure refers to the subcellular level structure of the surface. All three levels of structure are capable of eliciting cell responses; however, there is significant interest in the response of cells to nanoscale topography motivated by the presence of numerous nanoscale structures within the extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; There are a growing number of methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanostructures (many originating from the semiconductor industry) allowing for the creation of various topographies with controlled size, shape, and chemistry.&lt;ref name="Parikh-2012-Materials Science and Engineering: C"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parikh | first = K.

==== Physical cues ====
Physical cues are formed by creating an ordered surface structure at the level of the microstructure and/or nanostructure. Physical cues on the nanoscale have been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration, orientation, contact inhibition, gene expression, and cytoskeletal formation. This allows for the direction of cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and spreading.&lt;ref name="Parikh-2012-Materials Science and Engineering: C"/&gt; There are numerous methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanoscale topographies, which can be divided into those that create ordered topographies and those that create unordered topographies.

'''Ordered topographies''' are defined as patterns that are organized and geometrically precise.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Though there are many methods for creating ordered topographies, they are usually time-consuming, requiring skill and experience and the use of expensive equipment.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''[[Photolithography]]''' involves exposing a light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is place between the light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the [[photoresist]]. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; However, because the lower limit for size is a function of the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of [[polyimide]] channels (11&amp;nbsp;µm in height and 20–60&amp;nbsp;µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mahoney | first = M. J. | author2 = Chen, R. R.; Tan, J. &amp; Saltzman, W. M. |date=March 2005 | title = The influence of microchannels on neurite growth and architecture | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 771–778 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.03.015 | pmid = 15350782 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

In '''[[electron beam lithography]]''' (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is the choice of a positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gomez | first = N. | author2 = Lu, Y.; Chen, S. &amp; Schmidt, C. E. |date=January 2007 | title = Immobilized nerve growth factor and microtopography have distinct effects on polarization versus axon elongation in hippocampal cells in culture | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–284 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.07.043 | pmid = 16919328 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5&amp;nbsp;nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, as is the case in tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40&amp;nbsp;nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, [[isopropyl alcohol]] (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patterns in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and [[Solvent casting and particulate leaching|solvent casting]].&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2&amp;nbsp;µm wide and 400 and 800&amp;nbsp;nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.&lt;ref name="Gomez-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

'''[[X-ray lithography]]''' is another method for forming ordered patterns that can be used to investigate the role that topography plays in promoting neuritogenesis. The mask parameters determine the pattern periodicity, but ridge width and depth are determined by the etching conditions. In a study, ridges were created with periods ranging from 400 through 4000&amp;nbsp;nm, widths ranging from 70 through 1900&amp;nbsp;nm, and a groove depth of 600&amp;nbsp;nm; developing neurites demonstrated contact guidance with features as small as 70&amp;nbsp;nm and greater than 90% of the neurites were within 10 degrees of parallel alignment with the ridges and grooves.&lt;ref name="Foley-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Foley | first = J. D. | author2 = Grunwald, E. W.; Nealey, P. F. &amp; Murphy, C. J. |date=June 2005 | title = Cooperative modulation of neuritogenesis by PC12 cells by topography and nerve growth factor | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 17 | pages = 3639–3644 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.048 | pmid = 15621254 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was not a significant difference in orientation with respect to the feature sizes used. The number of neurites per cell was constrained by the ridges and grooves, producing bipolar rather than branching phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Foley-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

'''Unordered topographies''' are generally created by processes that occur spontaneously during other processing; the patterns are random in orientation and organization with imprecise or no control over feature geometry.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; The advantage to creating unordered topographies over ordered is that the processes are often less time consuming, less expensive, and do not require great skill and experience. Unordered topographies can be created by polymer demixing, colloidal lithography and chemical etching.

In '''polymer demixing''', polymer blends experience spontaneous phase separation; it often occurs during conditions such as spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; There is not much control in the horizontal direction, though the vertical direction of the features can be precisely controlled. Because the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height [[nanotopography|nanotopographies]].&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''Colloidal lithography''' is inexpensive and can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used to etch away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

'''[[Chemical milling|Chemical etching]]''' involves soaking the material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until the surface is etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale.&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt; Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it can be considered a surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with [[nanotopography|nanotopographies]]. [[Silicon]] wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of roughness (20–50&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="Norman-2006-ABM"/&gt;

==== Chemical cues ====
In addition to creating topography with physical cues, it can be created with chemical cues by selectively depositing polymer solution in patterns on the surface of a substrate. There are different methods for depositing the chemical cues. Two methods for dispensing chemical solutions include stripe patterning and piezoelectric microdispensing.

'''Stripe-patterned polymer films''' can be formed on solid substrates by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, and has no restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm/s.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tsuruma | first = A. | author2 = Tanaka, M.; Yamamoto, S.; Fukushima, N.; Yabu, H. &amp; Shimomura, M. | year = 2006 | title = Topographical control of neurite extension on stripe-patterned polymer films | journal = Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects | volume = 284–285 | pages = 470–474 | pmid = | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.colsurfa.2005.11.100 | last3 = Yamamoto | first3 = Sadaaki | last4 = Fukushima | first4 = Nobuyuki | last5 = Yabu | first5 = Hiroshi | last6 = Shimomura | first6 = Masatsugu }}&lt;/ref&gt; A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed at the edge of the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100&amp;nbsp;µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1&amp;nbsp;µm, 3.6 and 8.4&amp;nbsp;µm, and 4.3 and 12.7&amp;nbsp;µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt; Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2&amp;nbsp;µm, spacing: 6.1&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt; However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3&amp;nbsp;µm, spacing: 12.7&amp;nbsp;µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.&lt;ref name="Tsuruma-2006-C&amp;S"/&gt;

'''Microdispensing''' was used to create micropatterns on polystyrene culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive [[bovine serum albumin]] (BSA) solutions.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gustavsson | first = P. | author2 = Johansson, F.; Kanje, M.; Wallman, L. &amp; Linsmeier, C. E. |date=February 2007 | title = Neurite guidance on protein micropatterns generated by a piezoelectric microdispenser | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1141–1151 | pmid = 17109955 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microdispenser is a [[piezoelectric]] element attached to a push-bar on top of a channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.

For patterns containing 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/ml laminin, a higher proportion of neurites grew on the microdispensed lines than between the lines.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; On 10&amp;nbsp;mg/ml and 1&amp;nbsp;mg/ml BSA protein patterns and fatty-acid free BSA protein patterns a significant number of neurites avoided the protein lines and grew between the lines. Thus, the fatty-acid-containing BSA lines were just as non-permissive for neurite growth as lines containing BSA with fatty acids. Because microdispensing does not require direct contact with the substrate surfaces, this technique can utilitze surfaces with delicate micro- or nanotopology that could be destroyed by contact. It is possible to vary the amount of protein deposited by dispensing more or less droplets. An advantage of microdispensing is that patterns can be created quickly in 5–10 minutes. Because the piezoelectric microdispenser does not require heating, heat-sensitive proteins and fluids as well as living cells can be dispensed.&lt;ref name="Gustavsson-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

== Scaffold material ==
The selection of the scaffold material is perhaps the most important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It is important to note that the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

=== Hydrogel ===
[[Hydrogel]]s are a class of biomaterials that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, and the ability to be injected as a liquid that gels.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ma | first = W. | author2 = Fitzgerald, W.; Liu, Q.

=== Synthetic polymer ===
A [[synthetic polymer]] may be non-degradable or degradable. For the purpose of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate is dependent on the molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Because of a [[methyl group]], [[lactic acid]] is more hydrophobic than [[glycolic acid]] causing its hydrolysis to be slower.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Wu-2006-JHUST"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wu | first = Y. | author2 = Zheng, Q.; Du, J.; Song, Y.; Wu, B. &amp; Guo, X. | year = 2006 | title = Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells | journal = Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 594–596 | pmid = 17219978 | url = | doi = 10.1007/s11596-006-0530-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Pfister-2006-JNM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pfister | first = B.

==== Collagen-terpolymer ====
[[Collagen]] is a major component of the [[extracellular matrix]], and it is found in the supporting tissues of peripheral nerves. A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and cross-linked with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt; The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a cross-linker to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt; Because the collagen-terpolymer (collagen-TERP) hydrogel lacks a bioactive component, a study attached to it a common cell adhesion peptide found in [[laminin]] (YIGSR) in order to enhance its cell adhesion properties.&lt;ref name="Newman-2006-IJAO"/&gt;

==== Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) family ====
The polymers in the PLGA family include poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), and their copolymer poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). All three polymers have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for employment in various devices. These polymers are brittle and they do not have regions for permissible chemical modification; in addition, they degrade by bulk rather than by surface, which is not a smooth and ideal degradation process.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; In an attempt to overcome the lack of functionalities, free amines have been incorporated into their structures from which peptides can be tethered to control cell attachment and behavior.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt;

==== Methacrylated dextran (Dex-MA) copolymerized with aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA) ====
[[Dextran]] is a polysaccharide derived from bacteria; it is usually produced by enzymes from certain strains of [[leuconostoc]] or [[Streptococcus]]. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. Cross-linked dextran hydrogel beads have been widely used as low protein-binding matrices for [[column chromatography]] applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lévesque | first = S. G. |author2=Shoichet, M. S. |date=October 2006 | title = Synthesis of cell-adhesive dextran hydrogels and macroporous scaffolds | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 30 | pages = 5277–5285 | pmid = 16793132 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been until recently that dextran hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the macroporous geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.&lt;ref name="Lévesque-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) ====
A novel biodegradable, tough elastomer has been developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because it is able to recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a [[Young's modulus]] of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.&lt;ref name="Sundback-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Polyethylene glycol hydrogel ====
[[Polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) hydrogels are biocompatible and proven to be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mahoney | first = M. J. |author2=Anseth, K. S. |date=April 2006 | title = Three-dimensional growth and function of neural tissue in degradable polyethylene glycol hydrogels | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–2274 | pmid = 16318872 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able to serve as a scaffold for axon regeneration.&lt;ref name="Mahoney-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

=== Biological polymers ===
There are advantages to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are very likely to have good biocompatibility and be easily degraded, because they are already present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, there is always the possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; In the production of naturally-derived materials there will also be batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"/&gt; Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption.&lt;ref name="Cai-2005-JBMRa"/&gt; Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.

==== Polysialic acid (PSA) ====
Polysialic acid (PSA) is a relatively new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for artificial nerve conduits. It is a homopolymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues and a dynamically regulated posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Recent studies have demonstrated that polysialylated NCAM (polySia-NCAM) promotes regeneration in the motor system.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haile | first = Y. |author2=Haastert, K. |author3=Cesnulevicius, K. |author4=Stummeyer, K. |author5=Timmer, M. |author6=Berski. S. |author7=Dräger, G. |author8= Gerardy-Schahn, R. and Grothe, C.  |date=February 2007 | title = Culturing of glial and neuronal cells on polysialic acid | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1163–1173 | pmid = 17123601 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for induced degradation by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved in steering processes like neuritogenesis, axonal path finding, and neuroblast migration.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; Animals with PSA genetically knocked out express a lethal phenotype, which has unsuccessful path finding; nerves connecting the two brain hemispheres were aberrant or missing.&lt;ref name="Haile-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus PSA is vital for proper nervous system development.

==== Collagen Type I/III ====
[[Collagen]] is the major component of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able to be controlled by crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt; Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt; This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.&lt;ref name="Stang-2005-BME"/&gt;

==== Spider silk fiber ====
[[Spider silk]] fibers are shown to promote cellular adhesion, proliferation, and vitality. Allmeling, Jokuszies et al. showed that Schwann cells attach quickly and firmly to the silk fibers, growing in a bipolar shape; proliferation and survival rates were normal on the silk fibers.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allmeling | first = C. | author2 =  Jokuszies, A.; Reimers, K.; Kall, S. and Vogt P. M. |date=July–September 2006 | title = Use of spider silk fibres as an innovative material in a biocompatible artificial nerve conduit | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 770–777 | pmid = 16989736 | url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00436.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They used spider silk fibers to create a nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in a short amount of time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow ''in vivo'' after PNS injury.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt; Spider silk has not been used in tissue engineering until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt; Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks and the fact that it does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="Allmeling-2006-JCMM"/&gt;

==== Silkworm silk fibroin ====
In addition to spiders, silkworms are another source of silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of [[fibroin]] protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered that the cause of the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yang | first = Y. | author2 = Chen, X.; Ding, F.; Zhang, P.; Liu, J. and Gu, X. |date=March 2007 | title = Biocompatibility evaluation of silk fibroin with peripheral nerve tissues and cells in vitro | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1643–1652 | pmid = 17188747 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Chitosan ====
[[Chitosan]] and [[chitin]] belong to a family of biopolymers composed of β(1–4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine subunits.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freier | first = T. | author2 = Koh, H. S.; Kazazian, K. and Shoichet, M. S. |date=October 2005 | title = Controlling cell adhesion and degradation of chitosan films by N-acetylation | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 26 | issue = 29 | pages = 5872–5878 | pmid = 15949553 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitosan is formed by alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant natural polymer after cellulose.&lt;ref name="Itoh-2003-AO"/&gt; Chitosan is a biodegradable polysaccharide that has been useful in many biomedical applications such as a chelating agent, drug carrier, membrane, and water treatment additive.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; Chitosan is soluble in dilute aqueous solutions, but precipitates into a gel at a neutral pH.&lt;ref name="Huang-2005-JBMR"/&gt; It does not support neural cell attachment and proliferation well, but can be enhanced by ECM-derived peptide attachment. Chitosan also contains weak mechanical properties, which are more challenging to overcome.&lt;ref name="Crompton-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

Degree of acetylation (DA) for soluble chitosan ranges from 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; A study was conducted to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using [[acetic anhydride]] or [[alkaline hydrolysis]]. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan ''in vivo'' by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion.&lt;ref name="Freier-2005-Biomaterials"/&gt; Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help in the development of a nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.

==== Aragonite ====
[[Aragonite]] scaffolds have recently been shown to support the growth of neurons from rat hippocampi. Shany et al. (2006) proved that aragonite matrices can support the growth of astrocytic networks ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. Thus, aragonite scaffolds may be useful for nerve tissue repair and regeneration. It is hypothesized that aragonite-derived Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for promoting cell adherence and cell–cell contact. This is probably carried out through the help of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent adhesion molecules such as cadherins.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shany | first = B. |author2=Peretz, H. |author3=Blinder, P. |author4=Lichtenfeld, Y. |author5=Jeger, R. |author6= Vago, R. and Baranes, D.  |date=July 2006 | title = Aragonite crystalline biomatrices support astrocytic tissue formation in vitro and in vivo | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1763–1773 | pmid = 16889507 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.1763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aragonite crystalline matrices have many advantages over hydrogels. They have larger pores, which allows for better cell growth, and the material is bioactive as a result of releasing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which promotes cell adhesion and survival. In addition, the aragonite matrices have higher mechanical strength than hydrogels, allowing them to withstand more pressure when pressed into an injured tissue.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt;

==== Alginate ====
Alginate is a polysaccharide that readily forms chains; it can be cross-linked at its carboxylic groups with multivalent cations such as Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prang | first = P. |author2=Müller, R. |author3=Eljaouhari, A. |author4=Heckmann, K. |author5=Kunz, W. |author6=Weber, T. |author7=Faber, C. |author8=Vroemen, M. |author9= Bogdahn, U. and Weidner, N. |displayauthors=9  |date=July 2006 | title = The promotion of oriented axonal regrowth in the injured spinal cord by alginate-based anisotropic capillary hydrogels | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 19 | pages = 3560–3569 | pmid = 16500703 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.053 | last10 = Weidner | first10 = N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and have been used in tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.

Prang et al. (2006) assessed the capacity of ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, in addition to being able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target ''in vivo'' after a spinal cord injury.&lt;ref name="Prang-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

==== Hyaluronic acid hydrogel ====
[[Hyaluronic acid]] (HA) is a widely used biomaterial as a result of its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hou | first = S. |author2=Xu, Q. |author3=Tian, W. |author4=Cui, F. |author5=Cai, Q. |author6= Ma, J. and Lee, I. S.  | date = October 15, 2005 | title = The repair of brain lesion by implantation of hyaluronic acid hydrogels modified with laminin | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–70 | pmid = 15978668 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.04.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"/&gt; HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension.&lt;ref name="Hou-2005-JNM"/&gt; These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.

== Cellular therapies ==
In addition to scaffold material and physical cues, biological cues can also be incorporated into a bioartificial nerve conduit in the form of cells. In the nervous system there are many different cell types that help support the growth and maintenance of neurons. These cells are collectively termed glial cells. Glial cells have been investigated in an attempt to understand the mechanisms behind their abilities to promote axon regeneration. Three types of glial cells are discussed: Schwann cells, astrocytes, and olfactory ensheathing cells. In addition to glial cells, stem cells also have potential benefit for repair and regeneration because many are able to differentiate into neurons or glial cells. This article briefly discusses the use of adult, transdifferentiated mesenchymal, ectomesenchymal, neural and neural progenitor stem cells.

=== Glial cells ===
[[Glial cells]] are necessary for supporting the growth and maintenance of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Most glial cells are specific to either the peripheral or central nervous system. Schwann cells are located in the peripheral nervous system where they myelinate the axons of neurons. Astrocytes are specific to the central nervous system; they provide nutrients, physical support, and insulation for neurons. They also form the blood brain barrier. Olfactory ensheathing cells, however, cross the CNS-PNS boundary, because they guide olfactory receptor neurons from the PNS to the CNS.

==== Schwann cells ====
[[Schwann cells]] (SC) are crucial to peripheral nerve regeneration; they play both structural and functional roles. Schwann cells are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a peripheral nerve is damaged, Schwann cells alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation to become involved in [[Wallerian degeneration]] and Bungner bands.&lt;ref name="Yang-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt; In Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release neurotrophic factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using Schwann cells in neural tissue engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate Schwann cells and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nie | first = X. |author2=Zhang, Y.

Eguchi et al. (2003) have investigated the use of magnetic fields in order to align Schwann cells. They used a horizontal type superconducting magnet, which produces an 8 T field at its center. Within 60 hours of exposure, Schwann cells aligned parallel to the field; during the same interval, Schwann cells not exposed oriented in a random fashion. It is hypothesized that differences in magnetic field susceptibility of membrane components and cytoskeletal elements may cause the magnetic orientation.&lt;ref name="Eguchi-2003-NL"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eguchi | first = Y. | author2 = Ogiue-Ikeda, M. and Ueno, S. |date=November 2003 | title = Control of orientation of rat Schwann cells using an 8-T static magnetic field | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 130–132 | pmid = 14583398 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3940(03)00719-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collagen fibers were also exposed to the magnetic field, and within 2 hours, they aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, while collagen fibers formed a random meshwork pattern without magnetic field exposure. When cultured on the collagen fibers, Schwann cells aligned along the magnetically oriented collagen after two hours of 8-T magnetic field exposure. In contrast, the Schwann cells randomly oriented on the collagen fibers without magnetic field exposure. Thus, culture on collagen fibers allowed Schwann cells to be oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field and oriented much quicker.&lt;ref name="Eguchi-2003-NL"/&gt;

These findings may be useful for aligning Schwann cells in a nervous system injury to promote the formation of bands of Bungner, which are crucial for maintaining the endoneurial tube that guides the regrowing axons back to their targets. It is nearly impossible to align Schwann cells by external physical techniques; thus, the discovery of an alternative technique for alignment is significant. However, the technique developed still has its disadvantages, namely that it takes a considerable amount of energy to sustain the magnetic field for extended periods.

Studies have been conducted in attempts to enhance the migratory ability of Schwann cells. Schwann cell migration is regulated by integrins with ECM molecules such as fibronectin and laminin. In addition, neural cell adhesion molecule ([[NCAM]]) is known to enhance Schwann cell motility ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lavdas | first = A. A. | author2 = Franceschini, I.; Dubois-Dalcq, M. and Matsas, R. |date=June 2006 | title = Schwann cells genetically engineered to express PSA show enhanced migratory potential without impairment of their myelinating ability in vitro | journal = Glia | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 868–878 | pmid = 16598779 | url = | doi = 10.1002/glia.20340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAM is a glycoprotein that is expressed on axonal and Schwann cell membranes. Polysialic acid (PSA) is synthesized on NCAM by polysialyltransferase (PST) and sialyltransferase X (STX).&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt; During the development of the CNS, PSA expression on NCAM is upregulated until postnatal stages. However, in the adult brain PSA is found only in regions with high [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. PSA expression does not occur on Schwann cells.

Lavdas et al. (2006) investigated whether sustained expression of PSA on Schwann cells enhances their migration. Schwann cells were tranduced with a retroviral vector encoding STX in order to induce PSA expression. PSA-expressing Schwann cells did obtain enhanced motility as demonstrated in a gap bridging assay and after grafting in postnatal forebrain slice cultures.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt; PSA expression did not alter molecular and morphological differentiation. The PSA-expressing Schwann cells were able to myelinate CNS axons in cerebellar slices, which is not normally possible ''in vivo''. It is hopeful that these PSA-expressing Schwann cells will be able to migrate throughout the CNS without loss of myelinating abilities and may become useful for regeneration and myelination of axons in the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="Lavdas-2006-Glia"/&gt;

==== Astrocytes ====
[[Astrocytes]] are glial cells that are abundant in the central nervous system. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and [[fibroblasts]]; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.

The three distinct ways by which the cells acquired a 3D shape are:&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt;
# adhering to surface and following the 3D contour
# stretching some processes between 2 curvatures
# extending processes in 3D within cell layers when located within multilayer tissue

In conventional cell culture, growth is restricted to one plane, causing monolayer formation with most cells contacting the surface; however, the 3D curvature of the aragonite surface allows multiple layers to develop and for astrocytes far apart to contact each other. It is important to promote process formation similar to 3D ''in vivo'' conditions, because astrocytic process morphology is essential in guiding directionality of regenerating axons.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; The aragonite topography provides a high surface area to volume ratio and lacks edges, which leads to a reduction of the culture edge effect.&lt;ref name="Shany-2006-TE"/&gt; Crystalline matrices such as the aragonite mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches ''in vivo'' conditions.

==== Olfactory ensheathing cells ====
The mammalian primary [[olfactory system]] has retained the ability to continuously regenerate during adulthood.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ruitenberg | first = M. J. | author2 = Vukovic, J.; Sarich, J.; Busfield, S. J. and Plant, G. W. |date=March–April 2006 | title = Olfactory ensheathing cells: characteristics, genetic engineering, and therapeutic potential | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 23 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 468–478 | pmid = 16629630 | url = | doi = 10.1089/neu.2006.23.468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olfactory receptor neurons]] have an average lifespan of 6–8 weeks and therefore must be replaced by cells differentiated from the stem cells that are within a layer at the nearby epithelium's base. The new olfactory receptor neurons must project their axons through the CNS to an [[olfactory bulb]] in order to be functional. Axonal growth is guided by the glial composition and cytoarchitecture of the olfactory bulb in addition to the presence of [[olfactory ensheathing cells]] (OECs).&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;

It is postulated that OECs originate in the [[olfactory placode]], suggesting a different developmental origin than other similar nervous system microglia.

Another interesting concept is that OECs are found in both the peripheral and central nervous system portions of the primary olfactory system, that is, the olfactory epithelium and bulb.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;

OECs are similar to Schwann cells in that they provide an upregulation of low-affinity [[NGF receptor p75]] following injury; however, unlike Schwann cells they produce lower levels of [[neurotrophins]]. Several studies have shown evidence of OECs being able to support regeneration of lesioned axons, but these results are often unable to be reproduced.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg-2006-JN"/&gt;
Regardless, OECs have been investigated thoroughly in relation to spinal cord injuries, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], and other neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers suggest that these cells possess a unique ability to remyelinate injured neurons.&lt;ref name=Harberts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harberts|first=Erin|title=Human herpesvirus-6 entry into the central nervous system through the olfactory pathway|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13734–9|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105143108 |pmid=21825120|last2=Yao|first2=K.|last3=Wohler|first3=J.

OECs have properties similar to those of [[astrocytes]],&lt;ref name=CD46&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Cassiani-Ingoni | first1 = R.| last2 = Greenstone | first2 = H.

=== Stem cells ===
[[Stem cells]] are characterized by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be unipotent, multipotent, or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barrilleaux | first = B. | author2 = Phinney, D. G.; Prockop, D. J. and O'Connor, K. C. |date=November 2006 | title = Review: Ex Vivo Engineering of Living Tissues with Adult Stem Cells | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 3007–3019 | pmid = 17518617 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.3007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluripotent stem cells can become cells derived from any of the three embryonic germ layers.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"/&gt; Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt; Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.

==== Adult stem cells ====
Adult stem cells are not able to proliferate and differentiate as effectively ''in vitro'' as they are able to ''in vivo''. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, but it is difficult to isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used.&lt;ref name="Barrilleaux-2006-TE"/&gt; More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.&lt;ref name="Lavik-2004-AMB"/&gt;

==== Mesenchymal stem cells ====
[[Mesenchymal stem cells]] are adult stem cells that are located in the bone marrow; they are able to differentiate into lineages of mesodermal origin. Some examples of tissue they form are [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[fat]], and [[tendon]]. MSCs are obtained by aspiration of bone marrow. Many factors promote the growth of MSCs including: [[platelet-derived growth factor]], [[epidermal growth factor]] β, and [[insulin-like growth factor-1]]. In addition to their normal differentiation paths, MSCs can be transdifferentiated along nonmesenchymal lineages such as astrocytes, neurons, and PNS myelinating cells. MSCs are potentially useful for nerve regeneration strategies because:&lt;ref name="Keilhoff-2006-TE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keilhoff | first = G. | author2 = Goihl, A.; Stang, F.; Wolf, G. and Fansa, H. |date=June 2006 | title = Peripheral nerve tissue engineering: autologous Schwann cells vs. transdifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells | journal = Tissue Engineering | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1451–1465 | pmid = 16846343 | url = | doi = 10.1089/ten.2006.12.1451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# their use is not an ethical concern
# no immunosuppression is needed
# they are an abundant and accessible resource
# they tolerate genetic manipulations

Keilhoff et al. (2006) performed a study comparing the nerve regeneration capacity of non-differentiated and transdifferentiated MSCs to [[Schwann cell]]s in devitalized muscle grafts bridging a 2-cm gap in the rat sciatic nerve. All cells were autologous. The transdifferentiated MSCs were cultured in a mixture of factors in order to promote Schwann cell-like cell formation. The undifferentiated MSCs demonstrated no regenerative capacity, while the transdifferentiated MSCs showed some regenerative capacity, though it did not reach the capacity of the Schwann cells.&lt;ref name="Keilhoff-2006-TE"/&gt;

==== Ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) ====
The difficulty of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation is a large obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; EMSCs are [[multipotent]] and possess a self-renewing capacity. They can be thought of as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with [[dorsal root ganglion]] and motor nerve development. EMSC [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and [[neurotrophic factors]] essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name="Nie-2007-IJOMS"/&gt; Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines [[GDNF]], basic [[fibroblast growth factor]] and [[platelet-derived growth factor]], which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating [[MAP kinases]]. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10&amp;nbsp;mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. [[Myelinated]] axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.

==== Neural progenitor cells ====
Inserting neurons into a bioartificial nerve conduit seems like the most obvious method for replacing damaged nerves; however, neurons are unable to proliferate and they are often short-lived in culture. Thus, neural progenitor cells are more promising candidates for replacing damaged and degenerated neurons because they are self-renewing, which allows for the ''in vitro'' production of many cells with minimal donor material.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; In order to confirm that the new neurons formed from neural progenitor cells are a part of a functional network, the presence of synapse formation is required. A study by Ma, Fitzgerald et al. is the first demonstration of murine neural stem and progenitor cell-derived functional synapse and neuronal network formation on a 3D collagen matrix. The neural progenitor cells expanded and spontaneously differentiated into excitable neurons and formed synapses; furthermore, they retained the ability to differentiate into the three neural tissue lineages.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; It was also demonstrated that not only active synaptic vesicle recycling occurred, but also that excitatory and inhibitory connections capable of generating action potentials spontaneously were formed.&lt;ref name="Ma-2004-EN"/&gt; Thus, neural progenitor cells are a viable and relatively unlimited source for creating functional neurons.

==== Neural stem cells ====
[[Neural stem cells]] (NSCs) have the capability to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The [[neurotrophic factor]]s used were [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[fibroblast growth factor]]-2 (FGF-2), [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against [[nestin (protein)|nestin]], β-[[tubulin]] III, and [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]], which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively.&lt;ref name="Nakajima-2007-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nakajima | first = M. |author2=Ishimuro, T. |author3=Kato, K. |author4=Ko, I. K. |author5=Hirata, I. |author6= Arima, Y. and Iwata, H.  |date=February 2007 | title = Combinatorial protein display for the cell-based screening of biomaterials that direct neural stem cell differentiation | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1048–1060 | pmid = 17081602 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.&lt;ref name="Nakajima-2007-Biomaterials"/&gt;

== Neurotrophic factors ==
Currently, [[neurotrophic factors]] are being intensely studied for use in bioartificial nerve conduits because they are necessary ''in vivo'' for directing axon growth and regeneration. In studies, neurotrophic factors are normally used in conjunction with other techniques such as biological and physical cues created by the addition of cells and specific topographies. The neurotrophic factors may or may not be immobilized to the scaffold structure, though immobilization is preferred because it allows for the creation of permanent, controllable gradients. In some cases, such as [[neural drug delivery systems]], they are loosely immobilized such that they can be selectively released at specified times and in specified amounts. Drug delivery is the next step beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits.

== Biomimetic materials ==
Many biomaterials used for nerve guidance conduits are [[biomimetic materials]]. Biomimetic materials are materials that have been design such that they elicit specified cellular responses mediated by interactions with scaffold-tethered peptides from ECM proteins; essentially, the incorporation of cell-binding peptides into biomaterials via chemical or physical modification.&lt;ref name="Shin-2003-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shin | first = H. | author2 = Jo, S. and Mikos, A. G. |date=November 2003 | title = Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 24 | pages = 4353–4364 | pmid = 12922148 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00339-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synergism ==
[[Synergy|Synergism]] often occurs when two elements are combined; it is an interaction between two elements that causes an effect greater than the combined effects of each element separately. Synergism is evident in the combining of scaffold material and topography with cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors, and biomimetic materials. Investigation of synergism is the next step after individual techniques have proven to be successful by themselves. The combinations of these different factors need to be carefully studied in order to optimize synergistic effects.

=== Optimizing neurotrophic factor combinations ===

It was hypothesized that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of [[Nerve growth factor|NGF]], glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor ([[GDNF]]), and ciliary neurotrophic factor ([[CNTF]]) was presented to [[Dorsal root ganglion]] cultures ''in vitro''. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used.&lt;ref name="Deister-2006-JNE"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Deister | first = C. |author2=Schmidt, C. E. |date=June 2006 | title = Optimizing neurotrophic factor combinations for neurite outgrowth | journal = Journal of Neural Engineering | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–179 | pmid = 16705273 | url = | doi = 10.1088/1741-2560/3/2/011 | bibcode = 2006JNEng...3..172D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that there is not a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This was hypothesized to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients.&lt;ref name="Deister-2006-JNE"/&gt; Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.

=== Combination of neural cell adhesion molecules and GFD-5 ===
[[Cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) and neurotrophic factors embedded together into biocompatible matrices is a relatively new concept being investigated.&lt;ref name="Niere-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Niere | first = M. | author2 = Braun, B.; Gass, R.; Sturany, S. and Volkmer, H. |date=June 2006 | title = Combination of engineered neural cell adhesion molecules and GDF-5 for improved neurite extension in nerve guide concepts | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 18 | pages = 3432–3440 | pmid = 16497371 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMs of the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]] (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate neuronal differentiation. [[Neurotrophic factor]]s such as NGF and [[growth differentiation factor]] 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration ''in vivo''. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are not delivered individually.&lt;ref name="Niere-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; Not only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.

=== Topography in synergy with chemical and biological cues ===
The effect of presenting multiple stimuli types such as chemical, physical, and biological cues on neural progenitor cell differentiation has not been explored. A study was conducted in which three different stimuli were presented to adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs): postnatal rat type-1 astrocytes (biological), laminin (chemical), and micropatterned substrate (physical).&lt;ref name="Recknor-2006-Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Recknor | first = J. B. | author2 = Sakaguchi, D. S. and Mallapragada, S. K. |date=August 2006 | title = Directed growth and selective differentiation of neural progenitor cells on micropatterned polymer substrates | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 22 | pages = 4098–4108 | pmid = 16616776 | url = | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.03.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 75% of the AHPCs aligned within 20° of the grooves compared to random growth on the non-patterned substrates.&lt;ref name="Recknor-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt; When AHPCs were grown on micropatterned substrates with astrocytes, outgrowth was influenced by the astrocytes that had aligned with the grooves; namely, the AHPCs extended processes along the astrocytic cytoskeletal filaments. However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, the cells were stained with antibodies for class III β-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively. The greatest amount of differentiation was seen with AHPCs cultured on patterned substrates with astrocytes.&lt;ref name="Recknor-2006-Biomaterials"/&gt;

The '''Packard Humanities Institute''' ('''PHI''') is a [[non-profit foundation]], established in 1987, and located in [[Los Altos, California]], which funds projects in a wide range of [[conservation biology|conservation]] concerns in the fields of archaeology, music, film preservation, and historic conservation, plus Greek [[epigraphy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/ Packard Humanities Institute - Greek Epigraphy]&lt;/ref&gt; with an aim to create tools for basic research in the [[Humanities]].

==History==
Over the years, it has created databases on [[Latin literature]], [[Bible]] texts, texts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Ancient Greek [[papyri]] and inscriptions, [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]: [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others, and also [[Persian literature]] in translation. It also funds external projects such as the [[Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources]] and the complete works of [[C.P.E. Bach]].

PHI is also concerned with early education of children. The Institute is independent of the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] and is not associated in any way with any Hewlett-Packard Company foundations.

Its current president is former professor [[David Woodley Packard]], who has served as a director, but never an officer, of Hewlett Packard.

==National Audio-Visual Conservation Center==

[[File:Packard-campus-library-of-c.jpg|thumb|Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation]]
In 1997 with the approval of the [[United States Congress]] the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]] purchased the former high-security storage facility operated by the [[Federal Reserve Board]].  The facility  is located inside Mount Pony in [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. With Congress and the [[Library of Congress]] the facility was transformed into the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, which completed construction in mid-2007, called the Packard Campus (PCAVC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/the-library-of-congress-unlocks-the-ultimate-archive-system|title=Library of Congress Unlocks the Ultimate Archive System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation is a state-of-the-art facility funded as a gift to the nation by the Packard Humanities Institute. The Packard Campus is the site where the nation’s library acquires, preserves and provides access to the world’s largest and most comprehensive collection of motion pictures, television programs, radio broadcasts and sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/avconservation/ https://www.loc.gov/avconservation, Library of Congress AV webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; The Packard Campus is home to nearly 7 million collection items. It provides staff support for the Library of Congress National Film Preservation Board, the [[National Film Preservation Board]] and the national registries for film and recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-165.html loc.gov, News from the Library of Congress, by Press contact: Sheryl Cannady]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}
'''Procurement''' is the process of finding, agreeing terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive [[bidding]] process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services, or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weele|first=Arjan J. van|title=Purchasing and Supply Chain Management: Analysis, Strategy, Planning and Practice|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Andover|isbn=978-1-4080-1896-5|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimizing risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.

Almost all purchasing decisions include factors such as delivery and handling, marginal benefit, and price fluctuations. Procurement generally involves making buying decisions under conditions of scarcity. If good data is available, it is good practice to make use of economic analysis methods such as cost-benefit analysis or cost-utility analysis.

==Overview==
An important distinction should be made between analyses without risk and those with risk. Where risk is involved, either in the costs or the benefits, the concept of best value should be employed.

Procurement activities are also often split into two distinct categories, direct and indirect spend. Direct spend refers to the production-related procurement that encompasses all items that are part of finished products, such as raw material, components and parts. Direct procurement, which is the focus in [[supply chain management]], directly affects the production process of manufacturing firms. In contrast, [[indirect procurement]] concerns non-production-related acquisition: obtaining “operating resources” which a company purchases to enable its operations. Indirect procurement comprises a wide variety of goods and services, from standardized items like office supplies and machine [[lubricants]] to complex and costly products and services like heavy equipment, consulting services, and [[outsourcing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.A. and Roehrich, J.K. (2009), Contracts, relationships and integration: Towards a model of the procurement of complex performance. ''International Journal of Procurement Management'', 2(2):125–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, N.D. Roehrich, J.K. and Davies, A.C. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

=== Procurement vs. sourcing vs. acquisition ===
Procurement is one component of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement is viewed as more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition are viewed as more strategic and encompassing.

The [[Institute of Supply Management]] (ISM) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|title=ISM - Supply Management Defined|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213182841/https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines strategic sourcing as the process of identifying sources that could provide needed products or services for the acquiring organization. The term procurement used to reflect the entire purchasing process or cycle, and not just the tactical components. ISM defines procurement as an organizational function that includes specifications development, value analysis, supplier market research, negotiation, buying activities, contract administration, inventory control, traffic, receiving and stores. Purchasing refers to the major function of an organization that is responsible for acquisition of required materials, services and equipment.

The United States [[Defense Acquisition University]] (DAU) defines procurement as the act of buying goods and services for the government.&lt;ref name="DAUP 09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|title=Glossary of Defense Acquisition Acronyms and Terms, 12th Edition (plus updates since publication), accessed on 22 April 2009, Defense Acquisition University|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404030824/http://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|archivedate=4 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DAU defines acquisition as the conceptualization, initiation, design, development, test, contracting, production, deployment, Logistics Support (LS), modification, and disposal of weapons and other systems, supplies, or services (including construction) to satisfy [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] needs, intended for use in or in support of military missions.&lt;ref name = "DAUP 09"/&gt;

Acquisition and sourcing are therefore much wider concepts than procurement.

Multiple sourcing business models exist, and acquisition models exist.

===Acquisition process===
The revised acquisition process for major systems in industry and defense is shown in the next figure. The process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts, which are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field.&lt;ref name="DAUP 01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acquisition Process.jpg|center|thumb|560px|Model of the acquisition process&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;]]
The process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases. For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation, while a system based on mature and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or, conceivably, even production. The process itself includes four phases of development:&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;
* Concept and technology development is intended to explore alternative concepts based on assessments of operational needs, technology readiness, risk, and affordability.
* The concept and technology development phase begins with concept exploration. During this stage, concept studies are undertaken to define alternative concepts and to provide information about capability and risk that would permit an objective comparison of competing concepts.
* The system development and demonstration phase could be entered directly as a result of a technological opportunity and urgent user need, as well as having come through concept and technology development.
* The last, and longest phase is the sustainable and disposal phase of the program. During this phase all necessary activities are accomplished to maintain and sustain the system in the field in the most cost-effective manner possible.

===Sourcing business models===
Procurement officials increasingly realize that their make-buy supplier decisions fall along a continuum from simple buying transactions to more complex, strategic buyer-supplier collaborations. It is important for procurement officials to use the right sourcing business model that fits each buyer-seller situation. There are seven models along the sourcing continuum: basic provider, approved provider, preferred provider, performance-based/managed services model, [[Vested]] business model, [[shared services]] model and equity partnerships.
* A basic provider model is transaction-based; it usually has a set price for individual products and services for which there are a wide range of standard market options. Typically these products or services are readily available, with little differentiation in what is offered.
* An approved provider model uses a transaction-based approach where goods and services are purchased from prequalified suppliers that meet certain performance or other selection criteria. 
* The preferred provider model also uses a transaction-based economic model, but a key difference between the preferred provider and the other transaction-based models is that the buyer has chosen to move to a supplier relationship where there is an opportunity for the supplier to add incremental value to the buyer’s business to meet strategic objectives.
* A performance-based (or managed services model) is generally a formal, longer-term supplier agreement that combines a relational contracting model with an output-based economic model. It seeks to drive supplier accountability for output-based service-level agreements (SLAs) and/or cost reduction targets.
* A vested sourcing business model is a hybrid relationship that combines an outcome-based economic model with a relational contracting model. Companies enter into highly collaborative arrangements designed to create and share value for buyers and suppliers above and beyond.
* A shared services model is typically an internal organization based on an arm’s-length outsourcing arrangement. Using this approach, processes are often centralized into an SSO that charges business units or users for the services they use. 
* An equity partnership creates a legally binding entity; it can take different legal forms, from buying a supplier (an acquisition), to creating a subsidiary, to equity-sharing joint ventures or entering into cooperative (co-op) arrangements.

===Procurement software===
Procurement software (often labeled as [[e-procurement]] software) manages the purchasing processes electronically or via [[cloud computing]].

===Procurement life cycle===
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}Most of the organizations think of their procurement process in terms of a life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Different consulting firms and experts have developed various frameworks. Some of the most common steps from the most popular frameworks include:
* '''Identification of need and requirements analysis''' is an internal step that involves an understanding of business objectives by establishing a short term strategy (three to five years) for overall spend category followed by defining the technical direction and requirements.
* '''External macro-level market analysis''': Once an organization understands its requirements, it should look outward to assess the overall marketplace. A key part of a market analysis is understanding the overall competitiveness of the marketplace and trends that are likely to impact the organization.
*'''Cost analysis''' is the accumulation, examination and manipulation of cost data for comparisons and projections. A cost analysis is important to help an organization make a make-buy decision.
* '''Supplier identification''' includes identifying particular suppliers that can provide the required product or services. There are many sources to search for potential suppliers. One good source is trade shows. Modern procurement software often incorporates a supplier catalog for standardized goods and services.
* '''[[Non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA)''': It is quite normal to request vendors to sign an NDA prior to engaging with them. This protects the organisation where sensitive information is shared with multiple potential vendors ahead of releasing detailed requirements which often point to strategic decisions a firm has taken.
* '''Supplier communication:''' When one or more suitable suppliers have been identified, an organization will typically conduct a competitive [[bidding]] process. Organizations can use a variety of competitive bidding methods including [[requests for quotation]], [[Request for proposal|requests for proposals]], [[Request for information|requests for information]], [[Request for tender|requests for tender]], [[Request for Solution|request for solution]] or a request for partnership. Some institutions choose to use a [[notification service]] in order to raise the competition for the chosen opportunity. These systems can either be direct from their e-tendering software, or as a re-packaged notification from an external system. During this step direct contact may be made with the suppliers. References for product/service quality are consulted, and any requirements for follow-up services including installation, maintenance, and [[warranty]] are investigated. Samples of the product/service being considered may be examined, or trials undertaken. Organizations should do a risk assessment, [[total cost of ownership]] analysis and [[best value]] assessment before selecting the final suppliers/solution.
* '''Negotiations and contracting:''' [[Negotiation]]s are undertaken that often include price, availability, customization, and delivery schedules. The details are outlined in a [[purchase order]] or more formal [[contract]].
*'''Logistics and performance management:''' Supplier preparation, [[expediting]], shipment, delivery, and payment for the product/service are completed, based on contract terms. Installation and training may also be included. An organization should evaluate the performance of the product/service as they are consumed. A supplier scorecard is a popular tool for this purpose. When the product/service has been consumed or disposed of, the contract expires, or the product or service is to be re-ordered, the organization should review their experience with the product/service. If the product/service is to be re-ordered, the company determines whether to consider other suppliers or to continue with the same supplier.
* '''Supplier management and liaison:''' Organizations that have more strategic goods or services that require ongoing interfaces with a supplier will use a [[supplier relationship management]] process. Strategic [[outsourcing]] relationships should set up formal governance processes.

===Procurement performance===
The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply|Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply]] (CIPS) promotes a model of "five rights" which it claims are "a traditional formula expressing the basic objectives of procurement and the general criteria by which procurement performance is measured", namely that goods and services purchased should be of the right '''quality''', in the right '''quantity''', delivered to the right '''place''' at the right '''time''' and obtained at the right '''price'''.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; CIPS also offers an alternative listing of the five rights as "buy[ing] goods or services of the right quality, in the right quantity, from the right source, at the right time and at the right price.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS, [https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ Procurement Glossary - F] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081801/https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ |date=14 April 2017 }}, accessed 14 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardent Partners published a report in 2011 which presented a comprehensive, industry-wide view into what was happening in the world of procurement at that time by drawing on the experience, performance, and perspective of nearly 250 chief procurement officers and other procurement executives. The report includes the main procurement performance and operational benchmarks that procurement leaders use to gauge the success of their organizations. This report found that the average procurement department manages 60.6% of total enterprise spend. This measure commonly called "spend under management" refers to the percentage of total enterprise spend (which includes all direct and indirect spend) that a procurement organization manages or influences. The average procurement department also achieved an annual savings of 6.7% in the last reporting cycle, sourced 52.6% of its addressable spend, and has a contract compliance rate of 62.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=| url=http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| title=Ardent Partners Research - CPO 2011: Innovative Ideas for the Decade Ahead| access-date=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924045811/http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| archivedate=24 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Finance ===
Procurement and Finance have, as functions within the corporate structure, been at loggerheads. The contentious nature of their relationship can perhaps be attributed to the history of procurement itself. Historically, Procurement has been considered Finance’s underling. One reason behind this perception can be ascribed to semantics. When Procurement was in its infancy, it was referred to as a “commercial” operation. And so the procurement department was referred to as the ''commercial'' department rather than the procurement department: the word “commercial” was understood to be associated with money. And so it was obvious that Procurement would become directly answerable to Finance. Another factor, equally grounded in semantics, was that procurement departments (or rather, commercial departments) were always seen as “spending the money.” This impression was enough to situate Procurement within the Finance function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|title=Here’s What Happened To This Company After Procurement Was Freed From Finance’s Control|date=2017-02-22|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224024031/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It's easy to see why Procurement and Finance are functions with interests that are mutually irreconcilable. Whereas Procurement is fundamentally concerned with the spending or disbursal of money, Finance, by its very nature, performs a cost-cutting role. That is fundamentally the reason why Procurement's aspirations have been constantly checked by Finance's cost-cutting imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|title=Calling All CPOs: Here’s How You Can Stand Up To Your CFO|date=2017-01-25|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211042430/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion, however, has been changing as more chief procurement officers have begun to argue for more autonomy and less interference from Finance departments.

==Public procurement==
{{main article|Government procurement}}
Public procurement generally is an important sector of the economy. In Europe, public procurement accounts for 16.3% of the Community [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|title=Public contracts - Your Europe - Business|publisher=Europa.eu|access-date=16 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628072231/http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green public procurement===
In green public procurement (GPP), contracting authorities and [[entities]] take environmental issues into account when tendering for goods or services. The goal is to reduce the impact of the procurement on human health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |title=EC.Europa.eu |publisher=EC.Europa.eu |date= |access-date=16 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190556/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |archivedate=25 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative competitive bidding procedures ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}There are several alternatives to traditional competitive bid tendering that are available in formal procurement. One approach that has gained increasing momentum in the construction industry and among developing economies is the [[selection in planning]] (SIP) process, which enables project developers and equipment purchasers to make significant changes to their requirements with relative ease. The SIP process also enables vendors and contractors to respond with greater accuracy and competitiveness as a result of the generally longer lead times they are afforded.

==Fraud==
Recognizing the negative impact of procurement fraud, OECD has published guidelines on how to detect and combat bid rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|title=Detecting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement – OECD Guidelines|first=|last=networkthoughts|date=6 July 2016|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012181516/https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|archivedate=12 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procurement fraud can be defined as dishonestly obtaining an advantage, avoiding an obligation or causing a loss to public property or various means during procurement process by public servants, contractors or any other person involved in the procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23998519M/Combating_Procurment_Frauds|title=Combating Procurement Frauds Author Dr Irfan Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]], whereby a dishonest agent of the supplier pays a dishonest agent of the purchaser to select the supplier's bid, often at an inflated price. Other frauds in procurement include:
* Collusion among bidders to reduce competition.
* Providing bidders with advance "inside" information.
* Submission of false or inflated invoices for services and products that are not delivered or work that is never done. "Shadow vendors", shell companies that are set up and used for billing, may be used in such schemes.
* Intentional substitution of substandard materials without the customer's agreement.
* Use of "sole source" contracts without proper justification.
* Use of prequalification standards in specifications to unnecessarily exclude otherwise qualified contractors.
* Dividing requirements to qualify for small-purchase procedures to avoid scrutiny for contract review procedures of larger purchases.

{{short description| UK legislation protecting wreckage of military ships and aircraft }}
The '''Protection of Military Remains Act 1986''' (1986 c. 35) is an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which provides protection for the wreckage of military aircraft and designated military [[shipwreck|vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/35/ ''Protection of Military Remains Act 1986'' (UK)], legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act provides for two types of protection: ''protected places'' and ''controlled sites''.  Military aircraft are automatically protected but vessels have to be specifically designated.&lt;ref name="MCA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Protected Wrecks in the UK | publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] | url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-protectedwrecks.htm | accessdate=2008-08-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905172145/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-protectedwrecks.htm | archivedate=2008-09-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for designation is to protect as a '[[war grave]]' the last resting place of UK servicemen (or other nationals); however, the Act does not require the loss of the vessel to have occurred during war.&lt;ref name="legproj"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marine Archaeology Legislation Project page 23| publisher=[[English Heritage]] | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/marine_archaeology_legislation_project.pdf | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been six statutory instruments designating wrecks under the Act, in 2002&lt;ref name="SI2002"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2002 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1761/contents/made | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;(amended 2003&lt;ref name="SI2003"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2003 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/405/contents/made| accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), 2006&lt;ref name="SI2006"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2006 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2616/contents/made| accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2008&lt;ref name="SI2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2008 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/950/contents/made | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2009&lt;ref name="SI2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2009 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3380/contents/made | accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2012&lt;ref name="SI2012"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2012 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1110/contents/made|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2017&lt;ref name="SI2017"&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2017 | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/147/contents/made | access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Twelve wrecks are designated as controlled sites, on which diving is banned.  These twelve vessels (including one [[Unterseeboot B-81|German submarine]]), all lost on military service, provide a small representative sample of all such vessels.&lt;ref name="navynews2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Warship wrecks gain greater protection | publisher=[[Royal Navy]] | url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2001/0111/0001111201.asp | accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All other vessels that meet the criteria of the act are subject to a rolling programme of assessment and those that meet the criteria will be designated as protected places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lords Hansard text for 14 November 2005 (51114w04) |work=[[Hansard]] |publisher=Parliament Publication and Records | url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51114w04.htm | accessdate=2008-08-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The order that is currently in force, since March 2017, designates 79 wrecks as protected places. This means that diving is allowed but divers must follow the rule of ''look, don't touch''.&lt;ref name="navynews2001"/&gt;

==Protection under the Act==
The Act provides for two types of protection: ''protected places'' and ''controlled sites''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Protected Wrecks in the UK | publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] | url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-protectedwrecks/mcga-protectedwrecks-military.htm | accessdate=2008-07-21 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727032645/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-protectedwrecks/mcga-protectedwrecks-military.htm | archivedate=27 July 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary reason for designation is to protect the last resting place of UK servicemen (or other nationals).  While this is often referred to as protection as a war grave, the protected wrecks are not graves in the sense of falling under the control of the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], nor are they required to have been lost during wartime.&lt;ref name="legproj"/&gt;

The wreckage of all military aircraft (UK or other nations) that crashed in the United Kingdom, in United Kingdom territorial waters or in United Kingdom controlled waters are automatically protected irrespective of whether there was loss of life or whether the wrecking occurred during peacetime or in a combat.  The wreckage of United Kingdom military aircraft are also protected under the act elsewhere in the world.

===Protected places===
Wrecks are designated by name and can be designated as protected places even if the location of the site is not known.  Thus, the wreckage of a UK military aircraft is automatically a protected place even if the physical remains have not been previously discovered or identified.  Shipwrecks need to be specifically designated, and designation as a protected place applies only to vessels that sank after 4 August 1914 (the date of the United Kingdom's entry into the [[First World War]]).  The Act makes it an offence to interfere with a protected place, to disturb the site or to remove anything from the site.  Divers may visit the site but the rule is ''look, don't touch and don't penetrate''.  The law concerning protected places applies anywhere in the world, but in practice, outside the UK, the sanctions can only be enforced against UK citizens, UK flagged ships, or vessels landing in the UK, unless backed by local legislation.  The first and only licence granted in respect of a vessel designated a ''protected place'' was granted to Mike Williams of the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]], for a project to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the loss of the [[HMS M2|M2 submarine]] including the placing of a white ensign underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M2 Submarine Disaster Commemorated 75 years on| publisher=[[Nautical Archaeology Society]] | url=http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/projects/M2_2007.php | accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlled sites===
''Controlled sites'' must be specifically designated by location, where the site contains the remains of an aircraft or a vessel that crashed, sank or was stranded within the last two hundred years.  The Act makes it illegal to conduct any operations (including any diving or excavation) within the controlled site that might disturb the remains unless licensed to do so by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].  Licences have been granted for excavation of aircraft, provided that it is not thought that there are human remains present or unexploded ordnance.&lt;ref name="MODSPVA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aviation Archaeology | publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/Personnel/SPVA/AviationArchaeology.htm | accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sunken vessels, any activities necessary, such as the recovery of extant human remains and the sealing of openings into wrecks, is generally carried out by Ministry of Defence diving teams.  Controlled sites at sea are marked on [[admiralty charts]] and their physical location is marked by means of a buoy ([[sea mark]]).

==Protection of aircraft==
During the 1970s there was a rapid growth in excavation of the crash sites of military aircraft.  These were sometimes carried out by interested amateur souvenir hunters, and sometimes by more serious prospectors of valuable military artefacts.  The rights and wrongs of this activity was confused by conflicting statements from the Ministry of Defence, who, in 1973 stated that they had abandoned all claim to crashed planes and that any of official interest had been recovered.  Later on they reversed this position, claiming Crown title of both RAF and German wrecks and stating that any excavation required official permission, issuing guidelines and threatening that excavation without such permission was illegal interference with Crown Property.  Excavations continued however, and several incidents involving the discovery of human remains and live ordnance (along with concerns about divers and shipwrecks) led to the passing of the Protection of Military Remains Act in 1986.&lt;ref name="BA75f1a"&gt;{{cite web |title=Corroded in Action:Excavating plane crash sites can bring special rewards, by Saunders, Andy | publisher=British Archaeology | url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba75/feat1a.shtml | accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the passing of the Act, investigators have been able to obtain licences to excavate subject to a number of conditions.  The applicant must have thoroughly researched the crash and be able to identify the aircraft and the fate of the crew.  This research becomes the property of the Ministry of Defence.  The landowner of the site of the crash must have given permission.  Special conditions may be imposed by local councils or heritage agencies.  Following excavation all material recovered must be identified to the Ministry of Defence.  Personal property of the aircrew is likely to be returned to next of kin, and military artefacts of historical interest are likely to be placed in the care of the [[Royal Air Force Museum]], but the licensee may apply for ownership of other material.  Licences cannot be issued for sites where there is likely to be unexploded ordnance, and Ministry of Defence policy is not to issue licences where human remains are likely to be found.  The Ministry of Defence reserves the right to witness all excavations.&lt;ref name="MODSPVA"/&gt;

A large number of aircraft were lost in the sea off the South and East Coasts of England during the [[Second World War]].  These areas are commercially important for marine aggregates. Since the aircraft are protected under this Act, the discovery of aircraft remains during aggregate dredging means that dredging must stop and an exclusion zone around the position of the wreck established.  The disturbance of wrecks by dredging is also of concern for potential disturbance of human remains and because of damage to an important historical resource.  A project undertaken in 2007–2008 by [[Wessex Archaeology]] funded under the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund managed by [[English Heritage]], looked at the potential of the historical resource of such wrecks and also for issuing guidance to the aggregates industry to manage the impact of finding remains.&lt;ref name="WessexALSF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aircraft Crash Sites at Sea | publisher=[[Wessex Archaeology]] | url=http://blogs.wessexarch.co.uk/aircraftcrashsitesatsea/ | accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for designation of wrecks==
As a result of an extensive consultation carried out in 2000–2001, the Ministry of Defence announced that it would carry out a rolling programme of assessment of all British military wrecks known to have been lost on military service. Designation as a ''controlled site'' is only applicable in waters controlled by the United Kingdom.  Wrecks considered dangerous will be designated as ''controlled sites''. Wrecks that met a set of criteria would be designated.  Under the act, wrecks to be designated as ''controlled sites'' must have sunk within the last two hundred years.  Wrecks to be designated as ''protected places'' must have been lost after 4 August 1914.  The criteria for designation announced by the Ministry of Defence include: whether the wreck represents the last resting place of servicemen; whether the wreck has suffered sustained disturbance and looting, and whether designation is likely to stop such disturbance; whether diving on the wreck attracts public criticism; whether the wreck is of historical significance.  In addition it was announced that if a wreck designated as a ''protected place'' suffers sustained disturbance it will be designated as a ''controlled site''.&lt;ref name="navynews2001"/&gt;

==History of designations under the Act==
:''For a complete list see [[List of designations under the Protection of Military Remains Act]]''.
The Act was passed in 1986, partly in response to concerns over excavation of military aircraft, partly over public disquiet about the fate of sunken military ships and also because in the aftermath of the [[Falklands War]], public opinion supported the idea that a maritime war grave should be sacrosanct.  The ships of concern included {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|6}}, where it is alleged that personal possessions of casualties had been looted by divers and where the British Government gave rights for the salvage of {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} which had occurred without respecting the human remains that it contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bowens, Amanda|title=Underwater Archaeology: The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405175913&amp;site=1|edition=2nd Edition (2008)|date=|year=|month=|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-7591-3|chapter=International and National Laws Relating to Archaeology Under Water|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203124030/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405175913&amp;site=1|archivedate=3 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although the Act gave immediate protection to wrecked aircraft, the wrecks of ships needed to be individually designated to be protected.

[[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] (the ships of Force Z) as well as [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS Hampshire]] were included in the designations.  However, HMS ''Ardent'' and HMS ''Antelope'' were already protected (as prohibited sites because they were considered dangerous) by an order passed in 1983 under the [[Protection of Wrecks Act 1973#Falkland Islands protected wrecks|Falkland Islands Protection of Wrecks Ordinance 1977]].&lt;ref name="FIPOW"&gt;Protection of Wrecks Ordinance 1977 (No. 12) 7 July 1977 (Falkland Islands)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Protection of Wrecks (Ardent and Antelope Designation) Order 1983 (No. 2) 20 October 1983 (Falkland Islands)&lt;/ref&gt;  HMS ''Coventry'' and HMS ''Sheffield'' had to wait until 2006 to be protected.

The coordinates given for the position of {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|6}} had to be corrected in a subsequent order in 2003.&lt;ref name="SI2003"/&gt;

[[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']] was one of the protected places added.  At around the same time, the Falkland Islands issued an order under the Falkland Islands Protection of Wrecks Ordnance 1977 designating [[HMS Coventry (D118)|HMS ''Coventry'']] as a restricted area.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of Wrecks (Designation) Order 2006 (no. 24) 23 October 2006 (Falkland Islands)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Storaa'' judgment and third tranche===
{{main|SS Storaa}}
The [[SS Storaa|SS ''Storaa'']] was a merchant vessel sunk by a German torpedo on 3 November 1943 while she was part of a military convoy.  Those who died included Royal Navy personnel, as well as merchant seamen.&lt;ref name="HighCourt"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE QUEEN ON THE APPLICATION OF (1) ROSEMARY FOGG (2) VALERIE LEDGARD Claimants and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE, Case No: CO/132/2005 Neutral Citation Number: 2005 EWHC 2888 (Admin) |work=Richard Buxton.co.uk |url=http://www.richardbuxton.co.uk/reference/view.php?table=transcripts&amp;id=149&amp;flag=name |accessdate=2006-10-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420175123/http://www.richardbuxton.co.uk/reference/view.php?table=transcripts&amp;id=149&amp;flag=name |archivedate=2006-04-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }} In the transcript, the Judge, Mr Justice Newman, identifies the uncontested facts of the history of the SS Storaa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary Fogg and Valerie Ledgard (the claimants), the daughters of one of the men who died, Petty Officer James Varndell RN, requested that the Ministry of Defence designate the wreck.  When the Ministry of Defence refused on the grounds that this was a merchant ship and therefore not eligible for designation, the claimants launched a judicial appeal, supported by Peter Marsden (a local historian and maritime archaeologist) and the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Legal Fight to Protect Grave of Wartime Seamen | work=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 November 2003 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/15/military.arts| accessdate=2008-08-08 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge, Mr Justice Newmann, decided in favour of the claimants on 13 December 2005.&lt;ref name="HighCourt"/&gt;  The Ministry of Defence appealed, but on 5 October 2006, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Appeal Court]] upheld the High Court decision.  The court ruled that the act could apply to merchant vessels and that the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] was therefore required to reconsider whether or not the ''Storaa'' should be designated under the act.  Note that the judgement did not guarantee that the wreck would be designated, only that it was eligible for consideration.  However, the wreck was subsequently designated in 2008.&lt;ref name="SI2008" /&gt;

The third tranche came into force on 1 May 2008, revoking the 2006 order, but re-designating the wrecks and adding 10 more vessels designated as protected places.&lt;ref name="announce2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ten military shipwrecks protected as final resting places |work=Ministry of Defence – Defence News |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |url=http://www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/defencenews/historyandhonour/tenmilitaryshipwrecksprotectedasfinalrestingplaces.htm |accessdate=2008-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612163044/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/TenMilitaryShipwrecksProtectedAsFinalRestingPlaces.htm |archivedate=2008-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These included the first merchant ships to be protected, [[SS Storaa|SS ''Storaa'']] and ''[[Atlantic Conveyor]]'', which had been requisitioned to serve as a transport ship in the [[Falklands War]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7107">'''Protein–lipid interaction''' is the influence of [[membrane protein]]s on the [[lipid]] [[physical state]] or vice versa.

The questions which are relevant to understanding of the [[structure]] and [[Function (biology)|function]] of the membrane are: 1) Do intrinsic membrane proteins bind tightly to lipids (see [[annular lipid shell]]), and what is the nature of the layer of lipids adjacent to the protein? 2) Do membrane proteins have long-range effects on the order or dynamics of membrane lipids? 3) How do the lipids influence  the structure and/or function of membrane proteins? 4) How do [[peripheral membrane protein]]s which bind to the layer surface interact with lipids and influence their behavior?

== Binding of lipids to intrinsic membrane proteins in the bilayer ==

A large research effort involves approaches to know whether proteins have binding sites which are specific for particular lipids and whether the protein–lipid complexes can be considered to be long-lived, on the order of the time required for the turnover a typical [[enzyme]], that is 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; sec. This is now known through the use of [[Deuterium NMR|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR]], [[Electron spin resonance|ESR]], and [[fluorescent]] methods.

There are two approaches used to measure the relative affinity of lipids binding to specific membrane proteins. These involve the use of lipid analogues in reconstituted [[phospholipid]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing the protein of interest:
1) [[Spin label|Spin-labeled]] phospholipids are motionally restricted when they are adjacent to membrane proteins. The result is a component in the [[ESR spectrum]] which is broadened. The experimental spectrum can be analyzed as the sum of the two components, a rapidly tumbling species in the "bulk" lipid phase with a sharp spectrum, and a [[Motion (physics)|motionally]] restricted component adjacent to the protein. Membrane protein denaturation causes further broadening of ESR spin label spectrum and throws more light on membrane lipid-proteins interactions &lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1991) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21306553_Protein_heat_denaturation_and_study_of_membrane_lipid-protein_interactions_by_spin_label_ESR?ev=prf_pub "Protein heat denaturation and study of membrane lipid-protein interactions by spin label ESR"]. ''Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods'', vol. 22(1), pp. 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Spin-labeled and [[bromination|brominated]] lipid derivatives are able to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from membrane proteins. The efficiency of quenching depends on the distance between the lipid derivative and the fluorescent tryptophans.

== Perturbations of the lipid bilayer due to the presence of lateral membrane proteins ==

Most &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR experiments with deuterated phospholipids demonstrate that the presence of proteins has little effect on either the order [[parameter]] of the lipids in the bilayer or the lipid [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], as measured by relaxation times. The overall view resulting from NMR experiments is 1) that the exchange rate between boundary and free lipids is rapid, (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 2) that the order parameters of the bound lipid are barely affected by being adjacent to proteins, 3) that the dynamics of the [[acyl chain]] reorientations are slowed only slightly in the [[frequency]] range of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 4) that the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] and the dynamics of the polar headgroups are similarly unaffected in any substantial manner by being adjacent to [[transmembrane protein]]s. 13C-NMR spectrum also gives information on specific lipid-protein interactions of biomembranes &lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1991) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21376891_13C-NMR_studies_of_membrane_lipid-protein_interactions_upon_protein_heat_denaturation?ev=prf_pub "13C-NMR studies of membrane lipid-protein interactions upon protein heat denaturation"]. ''Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical methods'', vol. 23, pp. 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent results using non labeled optical methods such as [[Dual Polarisation Interferometry]] which measure the birefringence&lt;ref&gt;Alireza Mashaghi et al. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac800027s "Optical anisotropy of supported lipid structures probed by waveguide spectroscopy and its application to study of supported lipid bilayer formation kinetics"] ''Anal. Chem.'', 80 (10), 3666–3676 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;(or order) within lipid bilayers have been used to show how peptide and protein interactions can influence bilayer order, specifically demonstrating the real time association to bilayer and critical peptide concentration after which the peptides penetrate and disrupt the bilayer order.&lt;ref&gt;Tzong-Hsien Lee, Christine Heng, Marcus J. Swann, John D. Gehman, Frances Separovic, Marie-Isabel Aguilar, "Real time quantitative analysis of lipid disordering by aurein 1.2 during membrane adsorption, destabilisation and lysis", ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'' (BBA) - ''Biomembranes'' Volume 1798, Issue 10, October 2010, Pages 1977–1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backbone and solid chain dynamics of membrane proteins ==

[[Solid-state NMR]] techniques have the potential to yield detailed information about the dynamics of individual amino acid residues within a membrane protein. However, the techniques can require large amounts (100–200&amp;nbsp;mg) of isotopically labeled proteins and are most informative when applied to small proteins where spectroscopic assignments are possible.

== Binding of peripheral membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer ==

Many [[peripheral membrane protein]]s bind to the membrane primarily through interactions with [[integral membrane protein]]s.  But there is a diverse group of proteins which interact directly with the surface of the [[lipid bilayer]]. Some, such as [[myelin basic protein]], and [[spectrin]] have mainly structural roles.  A number of [[water-soluble]] proteins can bind to the bilayer surface transiently or under specific conditions.

[[Protein misfolding|Misfolding processes]], typically exposing hydrophobic regions of proteins, often are associated with binding to lipid membranes and subsequent aggregation, for example, during [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s, [[Stress (biology)|neuronal stress]] and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Narinder Sanghera, Marcus J. Swann, Gerry Ronan, Teresa J.T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">In [[computational complexity theory]], a numeric algorithm runs in '''pseudo-polynomial time''' if its [[Computation time|running time]] is a [[polynomial]] in the ''numeric value'' of the input (the largest integer present in the input) — but not necessarily in the ''length'' of the input (the number of bits required to represent it), which is the case for [[polynomial time]] algorithms. 

In general, the numeric value of the input is exponential in the input length, which is why a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm does not necessarily run in polynomial time with respect to the input length.

An [[NP-complete]] problem with known pseudo-polynomial time algorithms is called [[weakly NP-complete]].
An [[NP-complete]] problem is called [[strongly NP-complete]] if it is proven that it cannot be solved by a  pseudo-polynomial time algorithm unless [[P=NP]]. The strong/weak kinds of [[NP-hard]]ness are defined analogously.

==Example==
Consider the problem of [[Primality test|testing whether a number ''n'' is prime]], by naively checking whether no number in {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\{ 2, 3, \dots, \sqrt{n} \}&lt;/math&gt;}} divides &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; evenly.  This approach can take up to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{n} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;}} divisions, which is sub-linear in the ''value of n'' but exponential in the ''length of n'' (which is about &lt;math&gt;\log(n)&lt;/math&gt;).  For example, a number ''n'' slightly less than {{nowrap|10,000,000,000}} would require up to approximately 100,000 divisions, even though the length of ''n'' is only 10 digits. Moreover one can easily write down an input (say, a 300-digit number) for which this algorithm is impractical. Since computational complexity measures difficulty with respect to the ''length'' of the (encoded) input, this naive algorithm is actually exponential. It ''is'', however, pseudo-polynomial time.

Contrast this algorithm with a true polynomial numeric algorithm — say, the straightforward algorithm for addition:  Adding two 9-digit numbers takes around 9 simple steps, and in general the algorithm is truly linear in the length of the input.  Compared with the actual numbers being added (in the billions), the algorithm could be called "pseudo-logarithmic time", though such a term is not standard.  Thus, adding 300-digit numbers is not impractical.  Similarly, long division is quadratic: an ''m''-digit number can be divided by a ''n''-digit number in &lt;math&gt;O(mn)&lt;/math&gt; steps (see [[Big O notation]].)

In the case of primality, it turns out there is a different algorithm for [[AKS primality test|testing whether ''n'' is prime]] (discovered in 2002), which runs in time &lt;math&gt;O((\log {n})^6)&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example of a problem that, generally, can only be solved in pseudo-polynomial time is the [[Knapsack problem]] — unless P=NP.

==Generalizing to non-numeric problems==
Although the notion of pseudo-polynomial time is used almost exclusively for numeric problems, the concept can be generalized:
The function ''m'' is pseudo-polynomial if
''m''(''n'') is no greater than a [[polynomial function]] of the [[problem size]] ''n'' and an additional property of the input, ''k''(''n'').  (Presumably, ''k'' is chosen to be something relevant to the problem.)
This makes numeric polynomial problems a special case by taking ''k'' to be the numeric value of the input.

The distinction between the value of a number and its length is one of encoding: if numeric inputs are always encoded in [[Unary numeral system|unary]], then ''pseudo-polynomial'' would coincide with ''polynomial''.

== Roles ==

'''Auditor''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing their own companies or their suppliers for compliance to international quality standards such as [[ISO9000]] and [[AS9100]]. They may also be independent auditors under an auditing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc176sc2/home/page/iso-9001-auditing-practices-grou.html|title=ISO 9001 Auditing Practices Group|website=committee.iso.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process quality''': Quality engineers may be tasked with value stream mapping and statistical process control to determine if a process is likely to produce defective product. They may create inspection plans and criteria to ensure defective parts are detected prior to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveengineeringhq.com/process-quality-engineer/|title=Process Quality Engineer|website=''automotiveengineeringhq.com''|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplier quality''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing suppliers or performing root cause and corrective action at their facility or overseeing such activity to prevent the delivery of defective product.

== Software ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
IT services are increasingly interlinked in workflows across platform boundaries, device and organisational boundaries, for example in cyber-physical systems, business-to-business workflows or when using cloud services. In such contexts, quality engineering facilitates the necessary all-embracing consideration of quality attributes.

In such contexts an "end-to-end" view of quality from management to operation is vital. Quality engineering integrates methods and tools from [[enterprise architecture]]-management, [[Software product management]], [[IT service management]], [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]], and from [[software quality management]] and [[information security management]]. This means that quality engineering goes beyond the classic disciplines of software engineering, information security management or software product management since it integrates management issues (such as business and IT strategy, risk management, business process views, knowledge and information management, operative performance management), design considerations (including the [[software development process]], [[requirements analysis]], [[software testing]]) and operative considerations (such as configuration, monitoring, [[IT service management]]). In many of the fields where it is used, quality engineering is closely linked to compliance with legal and business requirements, contractual obligations and standards. As far as quality attributes are concerned, reliability, security and safety of IT services play a predominant role.

In quality engineering, quality objectives are implemented in a collaborative process. This process requires the interaction of largely independent actors whose knowledge is based on different sources of information.

== Quality objectives ==

[[Quality objectives]] describe basic requirements for [[software quality]]. In quality engineering they often address the quality attributes of availability, security, safety, reliability and performance. With the help of quality models like ISO/IEC 25000 and methods like the [[GQM|Goal Question Metric]] approach it is possible to attribute metrics to quality objectives. This allows measuring the degree of attainment of quality objectives. This is a key component of the quality engineering process and, at the same time, is a prerequisite for its continuous monitoring and control. To ensure effective and efficient measuring of quality objectives the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering |author1=Michael Kläs |author2=Frank Elberzhager |author3=Jürgen Münch |author4=Klaus Hartjes |author5=Olaf von Graevemeyer | title=Transparent combination of expert and measurement data for defect prediction: an industrial case study | accessdate=8 April 2014 | date=2–8 May 2010 | publisher=ACM New York, USA | volume=2 | url=http://www.klaes.org/Z-files/Klaes-2010-ICSE-Paper.pdf | pages=119–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actors ==

The end-to-end quality management approach to quality engineering requires numerous actors with different responsibilities and tasks, different expertise and involvement in the organisation.

Different roles involved in quality engineering:
* Business architect, 
* IT architect, 
* Security officer, 
* Requirements engineer, 
* Software quality manager,
* Test manager,
* Project manager,
* Product manager and 
* Security architect.

Typically, these roles are distributed over geographic and organisational boundaries. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to coordinate the heterogeneous tasks of the various roles in quality engineering and to consolidate and synchronize the data and information necessary in fulfilling the tasks, and to make them available to each actor in an appropriate form.

== Knowledge management ==

[[Knowledge management]] plays an important part in quality engineering.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=IEEE Software |author1=Jacek Czerwonka |author2=Nachiappan Nagappan |author3=Wolfram Schulte |author4=Brendan Murphy | title=CODEMINE: Building a Software Development Data Analytics Platform at Microsoft | accessdate=7 April 2014 | date=July–August 2013 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | volume=30 | number=4 | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/200717/CodeMine.pdf | pages=64–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality engineering knowledge base comprises manifold structured and unstructured data, ranging from code repositories via requirements specifications, standards, test reports, enterprise architecture models to system configurations and runtime logs. Software and system models play an important role in mapping this knowledge. The data of the quality engineering knowledge base are generated, processed and made available both manually as well as tool-based in a geographically, organisationally and technically distributed context. Of prime importance is the focus on [[quality assurance]] tasks, early recognition of risks, and appropriate support for the collaboration of actors.

This results in the following requirements for a quality engineering knowledge base:

* Knowledge is available in a quality as required. Important quality criteria include that knowledge is consistent and up-to-date as well as complete and adequate in terms of granularity in relation to the tasks of the appropriate actors.
* Knowledge is interconnected and traceable in order to support interaction between the actors and to facilitate analysis of data. Such traceability relates not only to interconnectedness of data across different levels of abstraction (e.g. connection of requirements with the services realizing them) but also to their traceability over time periods, which is only possible if appropriate versioning concepts exist. Data can be interconnected both manually as well as (semi-) automatically.
* Information has to be available in a form that is consistent with the [[domain knowledge]] of the appropriate actors. Therefore, the knowledge base has to provide adequate mechanisms for information transformation (e.g. aggregation) and visualization. The [[RACI matrix|RACI]] concept is an example of an appropriate model for assigning actors to information in a quality engineering knowledge base.
* In contexts, where actors from different organisations or levels interact with each other, the quality engineering knowledge base has to provide mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
* Quality engineering knowledge bases offer a whole range of possibilities for analysis and finding information in order to support quality control tasks of actors.

== Collaborative processes ==

The quality engineering process comprises all tasks carried out manually and in a (semi-)automated way to identify, fulfil and measure any quality features in a chosen context. The process is a highly collaborative one in the sense that it requires interaction of actors, widely acting independently from each other.

The quality engineering process has to integrate any existing sub-processes that may comprise highly structured processes such as [[IT service management]] and processes with limited structure such as [[agile software development]]. Another important aspect is change-driven procedure, where change events, such as changed requirements are dealt with in the local context of information and actors affected by such change. A pre-requisite for this is methods and tools, which support change propagation and change handling.

The objective of an efficient quality engineering process is the coordination of automated and manual [[quality assurance]] tasks. Code review or elicitation of quality objectives are examples of manual tasks, while regression tests and the collection of code metrics are examples for automatically performed tasks. The quality engineering process (or its sub-processes) can be supported by tools such as ticketing systems or security management tools.

'''Radiopharmacology''' or '''medicinal radiochemistry''' is [[radiochemistry]] applied to [[medicine]] and thus the [[pharmacology]] of radiopharmaceuticals ([[medicinal radiocompounds]], that is, [[pharmaceutical drug]]s that are [[radioactive]]). Radiopharmaceuticals are used in the field of [[nuclear medicine]] as [[radioactive tracer]]s in [[medical imaging]] and in [[therapy]] for many [[disease]]s (for example, [[brachytherapy]]). Many radiopharmaceuticals use [[technetium-99m]] (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a [[Gamma decay#Radioactive decay (gamma decay)|gamma-emitting]] [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] [[nuclide]]. In the book ''Technetium'' a total of 31 different radiopharmaceuticals based on Tc-99m are listed for imaging and functional studies of the [[brain]], [[myocardium]], [[thyroid]], [[lungs]], [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[kidneys]], [[skeleton]], [[blood]] and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schwochau, Klaus. ''Technetium''. Wiley-VCH (2000). {{ISBN|3-527-29496-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''radioisotope''''', which in its general [[word sense|sense]] refers to any radioactive [[isotope]] ([[radionuclide]]), has historically been used to refer to all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a [[radioactive tracer]] atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a [[gamma camera]] or similar gamma imaging device. An example is [[fludeoxyglucose]] in which [[fluorine-18]] is incorporated into [[deoxyglucose]]. Some radioisotopes (for example [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]]) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body.

==History==
See [[nuclear medicine]].

==Production==

Production of a radiopharmaceutical involves two processes:

* The production of the [[radionuclide]] on which the pharmaceutical is based.
* The preparation and packaging of the complete radiopharmaceutical.

Radionuclides used in radiopharmaceuticals are mostly radioactive [[isotopes]] of elements with atomic numbers less than that of [[bismuth]], that is, they are radioactive isotopes of elements that also have one or more stable isotopes. These may be roughly divided into two classes:

* Those with more neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as '''proton-deficient''', and tend to be most easily produced in a [[nuclear reactor]]. The majority of radiopharmaceuticals are based on proton deficient isotopes, with [[technetium-99m]] being the most commonly used medical isotope, and therefore nuclear reactors are the prime source of medical [[radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100708111326.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those with fewer neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as '''neutron-deficient''', and tend to be most easily produced using a proton accelerator such as a medical [[cyclotron]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/32941/Nuclear_Medicine_Brochure_May08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical use ==
Because radiopharmeuticals require special licenses and handling techniques, they are often kept in local centers for medical radioisotope storage, often known as [[radiopharmacy|radiopharmacies]]. A [[radiopharmacist]] may dispense them from there, to local centers where they are handled at the [[practical medicine]] facility.

==Drug nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals==
As with other pharmaceutical drugs, there is [[standardization]] of the [[drug nomenclature]] for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as atomic weight, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and superscript superimposed onto the INN name, because [[chemical nomenclature]] (such as IUPAC nomenclature) uses those. The [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, atomic weight) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as one and the same in some publications (e.g., ''[[AMA Manual of Style|AMA]],''&lt;ref name="AMA_10e_15.9.2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=[[AMA Manual of Style]] |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |chapter=15.9.2 Radiopharmaceuticals |chapter-url=http://www.amamanualofstyle.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The [[United States Pharmacopeia|United States Pharmacopeial Convention]] is a sponsor organization of the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN Council]], and the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7428">The maximal total '''range''' is the maximum distance an [[aircraft]] can fly between [[takeoff]] and [[landing]], as limited by fuel capacity in [[powered aircraft]], or cross-country speed and environmental conditions in [[unpowered aircraft]]. The range can be seen as the cross-country [[ground speed]] multiplied by the maximum time in the air. The fuel time limit for powered aircraft is fixed by the fuel load and rate of consumption. When all fuel is consumed, the engines stop and the aircraft will lose its propulsion.

'''[[Ferry flying|Ferry range]]''' means the maximum range the aircraft can fly. This usually means maximum [[fuel]] load, optionally with extra fuel tanks and minimum equipment. It refers to transport of aircraft without any passengers or cargo. '''Combat range''' is the maximum range the aircraft can fly when carrying [[List of aircraft weapons|ordnance]]. '''[[Combat radius]]''' is a related measure based on the maximum distance a warplane can travel from its base of operations, accomplish some objective, and return to its original airfield with minimal reserves.

==Derivation==
For most unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is variable, limited by available daylight hours, aircraft design (performance), weather conditions, aircraft potential energy, and pilot endurance. Therefore, the range equation can only be calculated exactly for powered aircraft. It will be derived for both propeller and jet aircraft. If the total weight &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of the aircraft at a particular time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;W_0 + W_f&lt;/math&gt;,
 
where &lt;math&gt;W_0&lt;/math&gt; is the zero-fuel weight and &lt;math&gt;W_f&lt;/math&gt; the weight of the fuel (both in kg), the fuel consumption rate per unit time flow &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (in kg/s) is equal to
 
&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dW_f}{dt} = -\frac{dW}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

The rate of change of aircraft weight with distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (in meters) is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dW}{dR}=\frac{\frac{dW}{dt}}{\frac{dR}{dt}}= - \frac{F}{V}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the speed (in m/s), so that

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dR}{dt}=-\frac{V}{F}{\frac{dW}{dt}}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the range is obtained from the definite integral below, with &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;  the start and finish times respectively and &lt;math&gt;W_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_2&lt;/math&gt; the initial and final aircraft weights

&lt;math&gt;R= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{dR}{dt} dt = \int_{W_1}^{W_2} -\frac{V}{F}dW =\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac{V}{F}dW&lt;/math&gt;.

The term &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called the specific range (= range per unit weight of fuel; S.I. units: m/kg). The specific range can now be determined as though the airplane is in quasi steady-state flight. Here, a difference between jet and propeller driven aircraft has to be noticed.

===Propeller aircraft===
With propeller driven propulsion, the level flight speed at a number of airplane weights from the equilibrium condition &lt;math&gt;P_a = P_r&lt;/math&gt; has to be noted. To each flight velocity, there corresponds a particular value of propulsive efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_j&lt;/math&gt; and [[brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt;. The successive engine powers can be found:

&lt;math&gt;P_{br}=\frac{P_a}{\eta_j}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding fuel weight flow rates can be computed now:

&lt;math&gt;F=c_p P_{br}&lt;/math&gt;

Thrust power, is the speed multiplied by the drag, is obtained from the [[lift-to-drag ratio]]:

&lt;math&gt;P_a=V\frac{C_D}{C_L}W&lt;/math&gt; ; here ''W'' is a force in newtons

The range integral, assuming flight at constant lift to drag ratio, becomes

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\eta_j}{g c_p}\frac{C_L}{C_D}\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac{dW}{W}&lt;/math&gt; ; here ''W'' is the mass in kilograms, therefore [[standard gravity]] ''g'' is added. Its exact value depends on the distance to the centre of gravity of earth, but it averages 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

To obtain an [[analytic expression]] for range, it has to be noted that specific range and fuel weight flow rate can be related to the characteristics of the airplane and propulsion system; if these are constant:

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\eta_j}{g c_p} \frac{C_L}{C_D} ln \frac{W_1}{W_2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Jet propulsion===
The range of jet aircraft can be derived likewise. Now, quasi-steady level flight is assumed. The relationship &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{C_D}{C_L}W&lt;/math&gt; is used. The thrust can now be written as:

&lt;math&gt;T=D=\frac{C_D}{C_L}W&lt;/math&gt; ; here ''W'' is a force in newtons

Jet engines are characterized by a [[thrust specific fuel consumption]], so that rate of fuel flow is proportional to drag, rather than power.

&lt;math&gt;F=-c_TT=-c_T\frac{C_D}{C_L}W&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[lift (force)|lift]] equation, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 S C_L = W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the air density, and S the wing area.

the specific range is found equal to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{F}=\frac{1}{c_T} \sqrt{\frac{C_L}{C_D^2}\frac{2}{\rho S W}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the range (in meters) becomes:

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{1}{c_T} \sqrt{\frac{C_L}{C_D^2}\frac{2}{g \rho S}}\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac {1}{\sqrt{W}}dW&lt;/math&gt; ; here &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is again mass.

When cruising at a fixed height, a fixed [[angle of attack]] and a constant specific fuel consumption, the range becomes:

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{2}{c_T} \sqrt{\frac{C_L}{C_D^2}\frac{2}{g \rho S}} \left(\sqrt{W_1}-\sqrt{W_2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the compressibility on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane are neglected as the flight speed reduces during the flight.

===Cruise/climb===

For long range jet operating in the [[stratosphere]] (altitude approximately between 11–20&amp;nbsp;km), the speed of sound is constant, hence flying at fixed angle of attack and constant [[Mach number]] causes the aircraft to climb, without changing the value of the local speed of sound.  In this case:

&lt;math&gt;V=aM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the cruise Mach number and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of sound]]. W is the weight in kilograms (kg). The range equation reduces to:

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{aM}{g c_T}\frac{C_L}{C_D}\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac{dW}{W}&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;a= \sqrt{\frac{7}{5} R_sT}&lt;/math&gt; ; here &lt;math&gt; R_s&lt;/math&gt;is the specific heat constant of air 287.16 &lt;math&gt; \frac{J}{kgK} &lt;/math&gt; (based on aviation standards) and &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 7/5 = 1.4&lt;/math&gt; (derived from &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{c_p}{c_v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_p=c_v+R_s&lt;/math&gt;). &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt;en &lt;math&gt;c_v&lt;/math&gt; are the specific [[Heat capacity|heat capacities]] of air at a constant pressure and constant volume.

Or  &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{aM}{g c_T}\frac{C_L}{C_D}ln\frac{W_1}{W_2}&lt;/math&gt;, also known as the ''Breguet range equation'' after the French aviation pioneer, [[Louis Charles Breguet|Breguet]].

[[File:Megger Time-Domain Reflectometer MTDR1.jpg|thumb|A [[time-domain reflectometer]]; an instrument used to locate the position of faults on lines from the time taken for a reflected wave to return from the discontinuity.]]
A signal travelling along an electrical [[transmission line]] will be partly, or wholly, [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] back in the opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] in the [[characteristic impedance]] of the line, or if the far end of the line is not [[Electrical termination|terminated]] in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.

This article is about [[signal reflection]]s on [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] lines. Such lines are loosely referred to as [[copper]] lines, and indeed, in telecommunications are generally made from copper, but other metals are used, notably [[aluminium]] in power lines. Although this article is limited to describing reflections on conducting lines, this is essentially the same phenomenon as optical reflections in [[fibre-optic]] lines and [[microwave]] reflections in [[waveguide]]s.

Reflections cause several undesirable effects, including modifying [[frequency response]]s, causing [[Overcurrent|overload]] power in [[transmitter]]s and [[overvoltage]]s on [[power line]]s. However, the reflection phenomenon can also be made use of in such devices as [[stub (electronics)|stubs]] and [[quarter wave impedance transformer|impedance transformers]].  The special cases of open circuit and short circuit lines are of particular relevance to stubs.

Reflections cause [[standing wave]]s to be set up on the line.  Conversely, standing waves are an indication that reflections are present.  There is a relationship between the measures of [[reflection coefficient]] and [[standing wave ratio]].

==Specific cases==
There are several approaches to understanding reflections, but the relationship of reflections to the [[conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s is particularly enlightening. A simple example is a step voltage, &lt;math style="vertical-align:-15%;"&gt; V\,u(t)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math style="vertical-align:baseline;"&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the step and &lt;math style="vertical-align:-15%;"&gt; u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit step function]] with time &lt;math style="vertical-align:baseline;"&gt; t&lt;/math&gt;), applied to one end of a lossless line, and consider what happens when the line is terminated in various ways. The step will be propagated down the line according to the [[telegrapher's equation]] at some velocity &lt;math&gt; \kappa&lt;/math&gt; and the incident voltage, &lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt;, at some point &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; on the line is given by&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pages&amp;nbsp;70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm i = V\,u(\kappa\,t - x)\,\! &lt;/math&gt;

The incident current, &lt;math&gt; i_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt;, can be found by dividing by the characteristic impedance, &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_\mathrm i = \frac{v_\mathrm i}{Z_0} = I\,u(\kappa\,t-x)&lt;/math&gt;

===Open circuit line===
[[File:Step disturbance on transmission line.svg|thumb|430px|'''Fig. 1.''' Step voltage disturbance ''V&amp;thinsp;u(t)'' is injected into the input of the line, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; travels down the line and is reflected back at the far end as ''v''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The incident wave travelling down the line is not affected in any way by the open circuit at the end of the line. It cannot have any effect until the step actually reaches that point. The signal cannot have any foreknowledge of what is at the end of the line and is only affected by the local characteristics of the line. However, if the line is of length &lt;math&gt; \ell&lt;/math&gt; the step will arrive at the open circuit at time &lt;math&gt; t = \ell/\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, at which point the current in the line is zero (by the definition of an open circuit). Since charge continues to arrive at the end of the line through the incident current, but no current is leaving the line, then conservation of electric charge requires that there must be an equal and opposite current into the end of the line. Essentially, this is [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] in operation. This equal and opposite current is the reflected current, &lt;math&gt; i_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt;, and since

:&lt;math&gt;i_\mathrm r = \frac{v_\mathrm r}{Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;

there must also be a reflected voltage, &lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt;, to drive the reflected current down the line. This reflected voltage must exist by reason of conservation of energy. The source is supplying energy to the line at a rate of &lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm i i_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt;. None of this energy is dissipated in the line or its termination and it must go somewhere. The only available direction is back up the line. Since the reflected current is equal in magnitude to the incident current, it must also be so that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm r = v_\mathrm i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These two voltages will ''add'' to each other so that after the step has been reflected, twice the incident voltage appears across the output terminals of the line. As the reflection proceeds back up the line the reflected voltage continues to add to the incident voltage and the reflected current continues to subtract from the incident current. After a further interval of &lt;math&gt; t = \ell/\kappa&lt;/math&gt; the reflected step arrives at the generator end and the condition of double voltage and zero current will pertain there also as well as all along the length of the line. If the generator is matched to the line with an impedance of &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; the step transient will be absorbed in the generator internal impedance and there will be no further reflections.&lt;ref name=Pai&gt;Pai &amp; Zhang, pages&amp;nbsp;89–96&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Equivalent generator and line.svg|thumb|300px|left|'''Fig. 2.''' Equivalent circuit of generator feeding a line.]]
This counter-intuitive doubling of voltage may become clearer if the circuit voltages are considered when the line is so short that it can be ignored for the purposes of analysis. The equivalent circuit of a generator matched to a load &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; to which it is delivering a voltage &lt;math&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as in figure&amp;nbsp;2. That is, the generator can be represented as an ideal voltage generator of twice the voltage it is to deliver and an internal impedance of &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Pai/&gt;

[[File:Equivalent generator open circuit.svg|thumb|250px|right|'''Fig. 3.''' Open circuit generator]]
However, if the generator is left open circuit, a voltage of &lt;math&gt; 2\,V&lt;/math&gt; appears at the generator output terminals as in figure&amp;nbsp;3. The same situation pertains if a very short transmission line is inserted between the generator and the open circuit. If, however, a longer line with a characteristic impedance of &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; and noticeable end-to-end delay is inserted, the generator – being initially matched to the impedance of the line – will have &lt;math&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; at the output. But after an interval, a reflected transient will return from the end of the line with the "information" on what the line is actually terminated with, and the voltage will become &lt;math&gt; 2\,V&lt;/math&gt; as before.&lt;ref name=Pai/&gt;

===Short circuit line===
The reflection from a short-circuited line can be described in similar terms to that from an open-circuited line. Just as in the open circuit case where the current must be zero at the end of the line, in the short circuit case the voltage must be zero since there can be no volts across a short circuit. Again, all of the energy must be reflected back up the line and the reflected voltage must be equal and opposite to the incident voltage by [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm r = -v_\mathrm i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;i_\mathrm r = -i_\mathrm i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As the reflection travels back up the line, the two voltages subtract and cancel, while the currents will add (the reflection is double negative - a negative current traveling in the reverse direction), the [[Duality (electrical circuits)|dual]] situation to the open circuit case.&lt;ref name=Pai/&gt;

===Arbitrary impedance===
[[File:Equivalent incident wave and load.svg|thumb|300px|'''Fig. 4.''' Equivalent circuit of an incident wave on a transmission line arriving at an arbitrary load impedance.]]
For the general case of a line terminated in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a [[wave]] traveling down the line and analyse it in the [[frequency domain]]. The impedance is consequently represented as a [[frequency]] dependant [[complex function]].

For a line terminated in its own characteristic impedance there is no reflection. By definition, terminating in the characteristic impedance has the same effect as an infinitely long line. Any other impedance will result in a reflection. The magnitude of the reflection will be smaller than the magnitude of the incident wave if the terminating impedance is wholly or partly resistive since some of the energy of the incident wave will be absorbed in the resistance. The voltage (&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{o}&lt;/math&gt;) across the terminating impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;), may be calculated by replacing the output of the line with an equivalent generator (figure&amp;nbsp;4) and is given by&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 34&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{o} = 2\,V_\mathrm{i} \frac {Z_\mathrm{L}}{Z_\mathrm{0} + Z_\mathrm{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

The reflection, &lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{r}&lt;/math&gt; must be the exact amount required to make &lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{i} + V_\mathrm{r} = V_\mathrm{o}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{r} = V_\mathrm{o} - V_\mathrm{i} = 2\,V_\mathrm{i} \frac {Z_\mathrm{L}}{Z_\mathrm{0} + Z_\mathrm{L}} - V_\mathrm{i} = V_\mathrm{i} \frac {Z_\mathrm{L} - Z_\mathrm{0}}{Z_\mathrm{L} + Z_\mathrm{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient,  &lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma} = \frac{\,V_\mathrm{r}\,}{V_\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

and substituting in the expression for &lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{r}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma} = \frac{V_\mathrm{r}}{V_\mathrm{i}} = \frac{I_\mathrm{r}}{I_\mathrm{i}} = \frac {Z_\mathrm{L} - Z_\mathrm{0}}{Z_\mathrm{L} + Z_\mathrm{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

In general &lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is a complex function but the above expression shows that the magnitude is limited to

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\mathit{\Gamma}\,\right| \le 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}( Z_\mathrm{L}), \operatorname{Re}( Z_0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

The physical interpretation of this is that the reflection cannot be greater than the incident wave when only passive elements are involved (but see [[negative resistance#Amplifiers|negative resistance amplifier]] for an example where this condition does not hold).&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages&amp;nbsp;8–10&lt;/ref&gt; For the special cases described above,

{|class="wikitable"
! Termination!!&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Open circuit||&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma} = +1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Short circuit||&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma} = -1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L} = R_\mathrm{L}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = R_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\mathit{\Gamma}) &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(\mathit{\Gamma})=0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

When both &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; are purely resistive then &lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; must be purely real. In the general case when &lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is complex, this is to be interpreted as a shift in [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the reflected wave relative to the incident wave.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Reflection phase change}}

===Reactive termination===
Another special case occurs when &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; is purely real (&lt;math&gt; R_0&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm L&lt;/math&gt; is purely imaginary (&lt;math&gt; j\,X_\mathrm L&lt;/math&gt;), that is, it is a [[Electrical reactance|reactance]]. In this case,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = \frac {j\,X_\mathrm L - R_\mathrm 0}{j\,X_\mathrm L + R_\mathrm 0}&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;|j X_\mathrm L - R_\mathrm 0| = |j X_\mathrm L+R_\mathrm 0|\,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathit \Gamma| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that all the incident wave is reflected, and none of it is absorbed in the termination, as is to be expected from a pure [[electrical reactance|reactance]]. There is, however, a change of phase, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, in the reflection given by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta =
\begin{cases}
\pi - 2\,\arctan\frac{X_\mathrm L}{R_\mathrm 0} &amp; \mbox{if } {X_\mathrm L} &gt; 0 \\
-\pi - 2\,\arctan\frac{X_\mathrm L}{R_\mathrm 0} &amp; \mbox{if } {X_\mathrm L} &lt; 0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Discontinuity along line===
[[File:Mismatched transmission line.svg|thumb|500px|'''Fig. 5.''' Mismatch of transmission line characteristic impedances causes a discontinuity (marked with a star) in the line parameters and results in a reflected wave.]]
A discontinuity, or mismatch, somewhere along the length of the line results in part of the incident wave being reflected and part being transmitted onward in the second section of line as shown in figure&amp;nbsp;5. The reflection coefficient in this case is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = \frac {\,Z_{02} - Z_{01}\,\,}{Z_{02} + Z_{01}}&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar manner, a transmission coefficient, &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt;, can be defined to describe the portion of the wave, &lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm t&lt;/math&gt;, that it is transmitted in the forward direction:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {V_\mathrm t}{V_\mathrm i} = \frac {2\,Z_{02}}{\,Z_{02}+Z_{01}\,\,}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Discontinuity on transmission line.svg|thumb|500px|'''Fig. 6.''' Lumped components or networks connected to the line also cause a discontinuity (marked with a star).]]
Another kind of discontinuity is caused when both sections of line have an identical characteristic impedance but there is a lumped element, &lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm L&lt;/math&gt;, at the discontinuity. For the example shown (figure&amp;nbsp;6) of a shunt lumped element,
&lt;span style="line-height:450%;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = \frac {-Z_0}{\,Z_0 + 2\,Z_\mathrm L\,}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {2\,Z_\mathrm L}{\,Z_0 + 2\,Z_\mathrm L\,}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;
Similar expressions can be developed for a series element, or any electrical network for that matter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages&amp;nbsp;34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Networks===
Reflections in more complex scenarios, such as found on a network of cables, can result in very complicated and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ''ring waves'' as they are known&lt;ref&gt;Term originally defined in [http://ecatalog.squared.com/techlib/docdetail.cfm?oid=0900892680079340 IEEE Standard 587 Applicability to Adjustable Frequency Control (Surge Voltages)]&lt;/ref&gt; persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components in the tens of MHz range.&lt;ref&gt;Standler, pages&amp;nbsp;74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standing waves==
For a transmission line carrying sinusoidal waves, the phase of the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, with respect to the incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the [[amplitude]] of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as [[node (physics)|nodes]]. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a [[standing wave]].&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident wave can be characterised in terms of the line's [[propagation constant]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, source voltage &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, and distance from the source &lt;math style="vertical-align:0%;"&gt; x' &lt;/math&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V\,e^{-\gamma\,x'}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is often more convenient to work in terms of distance from the load (&lt;math style="vertical-align:0%;"&gt; x = \ell - x'&lt;/math&gt;) and the incident voltage that has arrived there (&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm {iL}&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V_\mathrm {iL}\,e^{\gamma\,x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign is absent because &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is measured in the reverse direction back up the line and the voltage is increasing closer to the source. Likewise the reflected voltage is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm r = \mathit \Gamma\,V_\mathrm {iL}\,e^{-\gamma\,x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The total voltage on the line is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm T = V_\mathrm i + V_\mathrm r = V_\mathrm {iL}\,\left(e^{\gamma\,x} + \mathit \Gamma\,e^{-\gamma\,x} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is often convenient to express this in terms of [[hyperbolic function]]s

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm T = V_\mathrm {iL}\,\left[\left(1+\mathit \Gamma\,\right)\,\cosh(\gamma\,x) + \left(1-\mathit \Gamma\,\right)\,\sinh(\gamma\,x)\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the total current on the line is

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm T = I_\mathrm {iL}\,[(1-\mathit \Gamma\,)\,\cosh(\gamma\,x) + (1+\mathit \Gamma\,)\,\sinh(\gamma\,x)]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage nodes (current nodes are not at the same locations) and anti-nodes occur when

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial \left|V_\mathrm T\right|}{\partial x} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Because of the absolute value bars, the general case  analytical solution is tiresomely complicated, but in the case of lossless lines (or lines that are short enough that the losses can be neglected) &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt; j\,\beta&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase change constant]]. The voltage equation then reduces to trigonometric functions

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm T = V_\mathrm {iL}\,\left[(1+\mathit \Gamma\,)\,\cos(\beta\,x) + j\,\left(1 - \mathit \Gamma\,\right)\,\sin(\beta\,x)\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the partial differential of the magnitude of this yields the condition,

:&lt;math&gt;-2\operatorname{Im}(\mathit \Gamma\,) = \tan(2\,\beta\,x)&lt;/math&gt;

Expressing &lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt; in terms of wavelength, &lt;math&gt; \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, allows &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; to be solved in terms of &lt;math&gt; \lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;-2\operatorname{Im}(\mathit \Gamma\,) = \tan \left( \frac{\,4\,\pi\,}{\lambda} \,x\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathit \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is purely real when the termination is short circuit or open circuit, or when both &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm L&lt;/math&gt; are purely resistive. In those cases the nodes and anti-nodes are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \left(\,\frac{4\,\pi\,}{\lambda}\,x \right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

which solves for &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; at

:&lt;math&gt;x = 0,~~ \tfrac{1}{4}\lambda,~~\tfrac{1}{2}\lambda,~~ \tfrac{3}{4}\lambda,~ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; R_\mathrm L &lt; R_0&lt;/math&gt; the first point is a node, for &lt;math&gt; R_\mathrm L &gt; R_0&lt;/math&gt; the first point is an anti-node and thereafter they will alternate. For terminations that are not purely resistive the spacing and alternation remain the same but the whole pattern is shifted along the line by a constant amount related to the phase of &lt;math&gt; \mathit \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage standing wave ratio===
The ratio of &lt;math&gt; |V_\mathrm T| &lt;/math&gt; at anti-nodes and nodes is called the [[voltage standing wave ratio]] (VSWR) and is related to the reflection coefficient by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{VSWR}= \frac{1 + \left|\mathit \Gamma\,\right|}{1 - \left|\mathit \Gamma\,\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

for a lossless line; the expression for the current standing wave ratio (ISWR) is identical in this case. For a lossy line the expression is only valid adjacent to the termination; VSWR [[Asymptote|asymptotically]] approaches unity with distance from the termination or discontinuity.

VSWR and the positions of the nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called a [[slotted line]]. This instrument makes use of the reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at microwave frequencies. One use is that VSWR and node position can be used to calculate the impedance of a test component terminating the slotted line. This is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engen, pages&amp;nbsp;73–76&lt;/ref&gt;

VSWR is the conventional means of expressing the match of a radio transmitter to its antenna. It is an important parameter because power reflected back into a high power transmitter can damage its output circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;Bowick ''et al.'', page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Input impedance==
The input impedance looking into a transmission line which is not terminated with its characteristic impedance at the far end will be something other than &lt;math&gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt; and will be a function of the length of the line. The value of this impedance can be found by dividing the expression for total voltage by the expression for total current given above:&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm {in}} = \frac {V_\mathrm T}{I_\mathrm T} = Z_0 \frac {(1 + \mathit \Gamma\,)\cosh(\gamma\,x) + (1-\mathit \Gamma\,)\,\sinh(\gamma\,x)}{(1-\mathit \Gamma\,)\,\cosh(\gamma\,x) + (1 + \mathit \Gamma\,)\,\sinh(\gamma\,x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt; x = \ell&lt;/math&gt;, the length of the line and dividing through by &lt;math&gt; (1 + \mathit \Gamma\,) \cosh(\gamma\,x)&lt;/math&gt; reduces this to

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm {in}} = Z_0 \frac {Z_\mathrm L + Z_0\tanh(\gamma\,\ell)}{Z_0 + Z_\mathrm L\tanh(\gamma\,\ell)}&lt;/math&gt;

As before, when considering just short pieces of transmission line, &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt; j\,\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the expression reduces to trigonometric functions

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm {in}} = Z_0 \frac {Z_\mathrm L + j\,Z_0\tan(\beta\,\ell)}{Z_0 + j\,Z_\mathrm L\tan(\beta\,\ell)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Applications===
There are two structures that are of particular importance which use reflected waves to modify impedance. One is the [[stub (electronics)|stub]] which is a short length of line terminated in a short-circuit (or it can be an open-circuit). This produces a purely imaginary impedance at its input, that is, a reactance

:&lt;math&gt;X_{\mathrm {in}} = Z_0\tan(\beta\,\ell)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By suitable choice of length, the stub can be used in place of a capacitor, an inductor or a resonant circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–35, Matthaei ''et al.'', pages&amp;nbsp;595–605&lt;/ref&gt;

The other structure is the [[quarter wave impedance transformer]]. As its name suggests, this is a line exactly &lt;math&gt; \lambda/4&lt;/math&gt; in length. Since &lt;math&gt; \beta \ell = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; this will produce the inverse of its terminating impedance&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages&amp;nbsp;434–435&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm {in}} = \frac{{Z_0}^2}{Z_\mathrm L}&lt;/math&gt;

Both of these structures are widely used in [[distributed element filter]]s and [[impedance matching]] networks.

'''SAVE Britain's Heritage''' was created in 1975, European Architectural Heritage Year,  by a group of journalists, historians, architects, and planners to campaign publicly for endangered historic buildings. Through press releases, leaflets, reports, books and exhibitions, SAVE Britain's Heritage champions the cause of decaying country houses, redundant churches and chapels, disused mills and warehouses, blighted streets and neighbourhoods, cottages and town halls, railway stations, hospitals, military buildings and asylums.

From the start, SAVE Britain's Heritage has always placed a special emphasis on the possibilities of alternative uses for historic buildings and has, on a number of occasions, prepared its own schemes for re-use of threatened buildings. On repeated occasions, its proposals have been instrumental in giving threatened buildings a renewed lease of life.

SAVE Britain's Heritage is also very active on the broader issues of [[historic preservation|preservation]] policy. Many of its campaigns have altered the way [[architectural conservation|conservation]] now protects Britain's built heritage. SAVE's attack on insensitive shop fronts contained guidelines now adopted by many local planning authorities, and SAVE Britain's Heritage was the first organisation to campaign for the introduction of the Thirty Year Rule, which now makes outstanding post-war buildings in England and Wales eligible for listing. SAVE Britain's Heritage is a registered [[charitable organization|charity]] governed by a board of trustees.

==Achievements and Failures==
SAVE Britain's Heritage was instrumental in saving buildings such as: 
*[[Calke Abbey]] in [[Derbyshire]] &amp;mdash; acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1983
*[[The Grange, Northington]] in [[Hampshire]] &amp;mdash; the surviving parts were acquired and restored by [[English Heritage]]
*[[Peninsula Barracks]] in [[Winchester]] &amp;mdash; converted to private residential use in 1998
*[[Tyntesfield]] &amp;mdash; acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 2002

It is not always successful. Its campaign in 1977 to 1978 to save the [[Baltic Exchange]] building and its collection for the nation failed; it was unable to stop the demolition of historic buildings in the [[City of London]] to make way for the new Baltic Exchange and could not prevent the disposal of the interior of the Baltic Exchange, which had been damaged by a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] bomb in 1992. It is currently campaigning to save the General Market Buildings of [[Smithfield Market]] on [[Farringdon Road]] and the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]].

It has also established charitable trusts to restore the following:
*[[All Souls Church, Halifax]] &amp;mdash; a church by [[George Gilbert Scott]]
*[[Bank Hall]], [[Bretherton]] &amp;mdash; a Jacobean mansion, built from handmade brick for the Bannastre Family in 1608.
*[[Barlaston Hall]] in [[Staffordshire]] &amp;mdash; a [[Palladian]] villa by [[Sir Robert Taylor]]
*[[6 Palace Street]] &amp;mdash; the oldest building in [[Caernarfon]] outside [[Caernarfon Castle|the castle]]

==Publications==
SAVE Britain's Heritage has published many campaigning books and leaflets, including: 
*''The Concrete Jerusalem'' (1976), 
*''Elysian gardens'' (1979), 
*''Vanishing London: A catalogue of decay'' (1979), 
*''The Fall of Zion'' (1980), 
*''The Country House: to be or not to be'' (1982), 
*''Estates Villages who cares?'' (1983),
* ''Crisis at Saltaire'' (1986),
*''Pavilions in peril'' (1987), 
*''Bright future: the reuse of industrial buildings'' (1990),
* ''Stop the destruction of Bucklesbury'' (1992),
* ''Beacons of learning'' (1995),
* ''Mind over matter'' (1995),
* ''Silence in Court'' (2004),
* ''The Guildhall Testimonial'' (2006), 

Advocating the preservation and reuse of, amongst other things, nonconformist chapels, redundant Anglican churches, Victorian mental hospitals, country houses, their gardens and outbuildings, and industrial buildings.

It also publishes an action guide, to assist campaigners with setting up their own groups to advocate the case for particular buildings. It maintains an electronic register of around 700 "buildings at risk", and publishes a paper version of the register annually.

An exhibition highlighting the first 30 years of its work was held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">The ''Secretum philosophorum'' was a popular [[Latin language|Latin]] text originating in England c.1300–1350.
Ostensibly a treatise on the Seven [[Liberal arts|Liberal Arts]], it merely uses them as a framework in which to describe and demystify practical tricks, ‘tricks of the trade’ and applied science. 

==Sections==
Prologue (''Iste liber quem per manibus habemus vocatur Secretum Philosophorum.'')

Book I is nominally on ‘[[Grammar]]’ which ‘teaches us to write correctly’ (''Grammatica docet recte scribere et recte loqui''). Explaining that no-one can write correctly without the proper instruments, the subsequent text consists of technical recipes for the materials required ‘for correct writing’, plus some recipes for concealing meanings by the use of [[invisible ink]] and [[cipher]]s. Book I is thus in fact an [[:Category:Art technological sources|artists' recipe book]]. Book I thus includes recipes for [[pigment]]s, tempering, [[adhesive]]s, varnish, writing tablets, artificial [[pumice]] and [[invisible ink]], and for writing on metal by [[etching]]; many of these technical  recipes are unique, rare, variant or unusually early witnesses to practices, or clarify obscure recipes in other treatises; the instructions appear to be for amateur use. Book I then ends with homilies on ‘correct speaking’ (discretion and the dangers of lying), taken from the pseudo-Aristotle ''[[Secretum secretorum]]'', with a note on ‘[[weasel words]]’ for concealing meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.co.uk/ |title=Clarke, M. (2009) “Writing recipes for non-specialists c.1300: The Anglo-Latin Secretum Philosophorum, Glasgow MS Hunterian 110”, in '&amp;#39;Sources and Serendipity: Testimonies of Artists' Practice'&amp;#39; Edited by Erma Hermens and Joyce H Townsend, pp. 50-64 and Plate 18. London: Archetype Publications |publisher=Archetype.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book II, ‘[[Rhetoric]]’ ‘teaches ornate speech’ (''Rethorica docet ornate loqui''). It collects [[riddle]]s.

Book III, ‘[[Dialectic]]’ ‘teaches to discern between true and false’ (''Dialetica docet discernere verum a falso et ab apparenti vero''). It collects various tricks for deceiving the five [[senses]], with mirrors and conjuring tricks.

Book IV, ‘[[Arithmetic]]’ ‘teaches numbers per se’ (''Arismetrica docet de numero per se''). It rejoices in the multiplication of chains of immense numbers.

Part V, ‘[[Medieval music|Music]]’ ‘teaches the numbers of sound’ (''Musica docet de numero sonoro''). It describes the [[monochord]], and a recipe for [[catgut|gut]] [[String instrument|strings]].

Book VI, ‘[[Geometry]]’ ‘teaches magnitudes, i.e. to measure’ (''Geometria docet de magnitudinibus id est de mensuris quantitatum''). It gives practical tricks for measuring, especially buildings.

Book VII, ‘[[Astrology and astronomy|Astronomy]]’ ‘teaches movements of the heavens and their effects on men’ (''Astronomia docet de magnitudine mobili hoc est de motibus firmamenti et planetarum et eorum effectibus''). It is principally astrology, but includes a very early illustrated treatise on [[hydraulics]].

==Manuscripts, editions and translations==
Nearly 30 [[manuscript]]s of the ''Secretum philosophorum'' survive,&lt;ref&gt;Most of which are listed in Clarke 2009 ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; making it something of a medieval 'bestseller', and [[Lynn Thorndike]] considered the ''Secretum philosophorum''  to have formed part of the general intellectual furniture of most even partially well-read individuals, and urged its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/224682 Thorndike, Lynn "Prospectus for a Corpus of Medieval Scientific Literature in Latin" ''Isis'' Vol. 14 No. 2 (Oct. 1930) pp.368-384: p. 379 item 120]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, as yet no complete edition or translation has been published.

Book I: An edition and translation of the recipes for [[scribe]]s and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators]], together with a technical commentary, has been published by Clarke (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; which see for a list of surviving manuscripts.

Book II: Some of the riddles are edited (with suggested solutions) by Galloway (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2864706 Andrew Galloway, The Rhetoric of Riddling in Late-Medieval England: The "Oxford" Riddles, the Secretum philosophorum, and the Riddles in Piers Plowman, ''Speculum'' 70 (1995): 68-105]&lt;/ref&gt;

Book III: An edition, English translation, and commentary has been published by Goulding (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Goulding, Robert. “Deceiving the Senses in the Thirteenth Century: Trickery and Illusion in the Secretum Philosophorum” in ''Magic and the Classical Tradition'', ed. Charles S. F. Burnett and William F. Ryan, Warburg Institute Colloquia 7, London: Warburg Institute and Turin: Nino Aragono Editore (2006), pp. 135-162. &lt;/ref&gt;

Book V: The recipe for [[catgut|gut strings]] has been published by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Handschin|de}} (1944-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handschin |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Handschin |title=Aus der alten Musiktheorie.

The '''sievert''' (symbol: '''Sv'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not be confused with the [[sverdrup]] or the [[svedberg]], two non-SI units that sometimes use the same symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] of [[ionizing radiation]] dose in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) and is a measure of the health effect of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body. The sievert is of importance in [[dosimetry]] and [[radiation protection]], and is named after [[Rolf Maximilian Sievert]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] medical physicist renowned for work on radiation dose measurement and research into the biological effects of radiation.

The sievert is used for radiation dose quantities such as [[equivalent dose]] and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, and [[committed dose]] which represents the risk of internal irradiation due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. The sievert is intended to represent the [[stochastic]] health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of [[radiation-induced cancer]] and genetic damage. One sievert carries with it a 5.5% chance of eventually developing cancer based on the [[linear no-threshold model]].&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says, "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues." ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt;

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] into equivalent dose and effective dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these. These are under continual review, and changes are advised in the formal "Reports" of those bodies.

Conventionally, the sievert is not used for high dose rates of radiation that produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, such as [[acute radiation syndrome]]; these effects are compared to the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] measured by the unit [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

One sievert equals 100 [[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]]. The rem is an older, non-SI unit of measurement.

==Definition==

===CIPM definition of the sievert===

The SI definition given by the [[CIPM|International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM)]] says:

"The quantity dose equivalent ''H'' is the product of the absorbed dose ''D'' of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor ''Q'' (quality factor) defined as a function of [[linear energy transfer]] by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|ICRU]]"

:''H'' = ''Q'' × ''D''&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"&gt;{{citation |title=CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ |year=2000 |publisher=BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of ''Q'' is not defined further by CIPM, but it requires the use of the relevant ICRU recommendations to provide this value.

The CIPM also says that "in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose ''D'' and the dose equivalent ''H'', the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose ''D'' and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent ''H''".&lt;ref name="CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2"/&gt;

In summary:

'''The gray''' – quantity ''D''
:1&amp;nbsp;Gy = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a physical quantity. 1&amp;nbsp;Gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kg of matter or tissue.

'''The sievert''' – quantity ''H''
:1&amp;nbsp;Sv = 1&amp;nbsp;joule/kilogram – a biological effect. The sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue.  The equivalence to absorbed dose is denoted by Q.

===ICRP definition of the sievert===
The ICRP definition of the sievert is:&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;
: "The sievert is the special name for the SI unit of equivalent dose, effective dose, and operational dose quantities. The unit is joule per kilogram."

The sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the ICRP and ICRU.

===Naming conventions===
The ICRU/ICRP dose quantities have specific purposes and meanings, but some use common words in a different order. There can be confusion between, for instance, ''equivalent dose'' and ''dose equivalent''.

Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function (Q) of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 60 published in 1991&lt;/ref&gt; developed the "protection" dose quantities ''effective'' and ''equivalent'' dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase ''dose equivalent'' in their name. Only the operational dose quantities which still use Q for calculation retain the phrase ''dose equivalent''. However, there are joint ICRU/ICRP proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities. These were outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015, and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing "dose to lens of eye" and "dose to local skin" as ''equivalent doses''.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

In the [[United states of america|USA]] there are differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2009/pdfs/9444.pdf "The confusing world of radiation dosimetry"] - M.A. Boyd, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009. An account of chronological differences between US and ICRP dosimetry systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External dose quantities==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External radiation dose quantities used in radiological protection]]
The sievert is used to represent the biological effects of different forms of external ionizing radiation on various types of human tissue. Some quantities cannot be practically measured, but they must be related to actual instrumentation and dosimetry measurements. The resultant complexity has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the ICRU working with the ICRP.

The external dose quantities and their relationships are shown in the accompanying diagram. The ICRU is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities, based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology, and the ICRP is primarily responsible for the protection quantities, based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body.

===Physical quantities===
These are directly measurable physical quantities in which no allowance has been made for biological effects. Radiation [[fluence]] is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time, [[Kerma (physics)|kerma]] is the ionising effect of the radiation field, and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass.

===Protection quantities===
Protection quantities are calculated models, and are used as "limiting quantities" to specify exposure limits to ensure, in the words of ICRP, "that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration"&gt;{{citation |title=Calibration of Radiation Protection Monitoring Instruments |series=Safety Reports Series 16 |quote=In 1991, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [7] recommended a revised system of dose limitation, including specification of primary ''limiting quantities'' for radiation protection purposes. These protection quantities are essentially unmeasurable |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/P074_scr.pdf |year=2000 |publisher=IAEA |isbn=92-0-100100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These quantities cannot be measured in practice but their values are derived using models of external dose to internal organs of the human body, using [[Computational human phantom|anthropomorphic phantom]]s. These are 3D computational models of the body which take into account a number of complex effects such as body self-shielding and internal scattering of radiation. The calculation starts with organ absorbed dose, and then applies radiation and tissue weighting factors.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B64&lt;/ref&gt;

As protection quantities cannot practically be measured, operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational quantities===
Operational quantities can be measured in practice, and are the means of measuring dose uptake due to exposure or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment, in relation to protection dose values. In this way they are used for practical dose control, by providing an estimate or upper limit for the value of the protection quantities related to an exposure. They are used in practical regulations and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B147&lt;/ref&gt;

The calibration of individual and area dosemeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision "air kerma free in air" under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium. Then the appropriate operational quantity is derived applying a conversion coefficient that relates the air kerma to the appropriate operational quantity. The conversion coefficients for photon radiation are published by the ICRU.&lt;ref&gt;''Measurement of H*(10) and Hp(10) in Mixed High-Energy Electron and Photon Fields.''  E. Gargioni, L. Büermann and H.-M. Kramer Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple (non-anthropomorphic) "phantoms" are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation. The ICRU sphere phantom is based on the definition of an ICRU 4-element tissue-equivalent material which does not really exist and cannot be fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;"Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure,  Actual Shortcomings and Alternative Options", G. Dietze, D.T.  Bartlett, N.E. Hertel, given at IRPA 2012, Glasgow, Scotland. May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRU sphere is a theoretical 30&amp;nbsp;cm diameter "tissue equivalent" sphere consisting of a material with a density of 1 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and a mass composition of 76.2% oxygen, 11.1% carbon, 10.1% hydrogen and 2.6% nitrogen. This material is specified to most closely approximate human tissue in its absorption properties. According to the ICRP, the ICRU "sphere phantom" in most cases adequately approximates the human body as regards the scattering and attenuation of penetrating radiation fields under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B159&lt;/ref&gt; Thus radiation of a particular energy fluence will have roughly the same energy deposition within the sphere as it would in the equivalent mass of human tissue.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

To allow for back-scattering and absorption of the human body, the "slab phantom" is used to represent the human torso for practical calibration of whole body dosimeters. The slab phantom is {{nowrap|300 mm × 300 mm × 150 mm}} depth to represent the human torso.&lt;ref name="IAEACalibration" /&gt;

The joint ICRU/ICRP proposals outlined at the 3rd International Symposium on Radiological Protection in October 2015 to change the definition of operational quantities would not change the present use of calibration phantoms or reference radiation fields.&lt;ref name="endo" /&gt;

===Instrument and dosimetry response===
This is an actual reading obtained from such as an ambient dose [[gamma ray|gamma]] monitor, or a personal [[dosimeter]]. Such instruments are calibrated using radiation metrology techniques which will trace them to a national radiation standard, and thereby relate them to an operational quantity. The readings of instruments and dosimeters are used to prevent the uptake of excessive dose and to provide records of dose uptake to satisfy radiation safety legislation; such as in the [[UK]], the [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]].

==Calculating protection dose quantities==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of "protection dose" quantities in [[SI]] units]]
The sievert is used in external radiation protection for [[equivalent dose]] (the external-source, whole-body exposure effects, in a uniform field), and [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] (which depends on the body parts irradiated).

These dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the [[stochastic]] health effects of radiation, and use of the sievert implies that appropriate [[Relative biological effectiveness|weighting factors]] have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation (expressed in grays).&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=2007 |volume=37 |series=ICRP publication 103 |issue=2–4 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP calculation provides two weighting factors to enable the calculation of protection quantities.
:&amp;nbsp;1. The radiation factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for radiation type ''R'' – This is used in calculating the equivalent dose ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; which can be for the whole body or for individual organs.
:&amp;nbsp;2. The tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is specific for tissue type T being irradiated. This is used with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate the contributory organ doses to arrive at an effective dose ''E'' for non-uniform irradiation.

When a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used, and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose. But if the irradiation of a body is partial or non-uniform the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is used to calculate dose to each organ or tissue. These are then summed to obtain the effective dose. In the case of uniform irradiation of the human body, these summate to 1, but in the case of partial or non-uniform irradiation, they will summate to a lower value depending on the organs concerned; reflecting the lower overall health effect. The calculation process is shown on the accompanying diagram. This approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body, taking into account complete or partial irradiation, and the radiation type or types.
The values of these weighting factors are conservatively chosen to be greater than the bulk of experimental values observed for the most sensitive cell types, based on averages of those obtained for the human population.

===Radiation type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{Main article|equivalent dose}}

Since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy, a corrective [[Relative biological effectiveness|radiation weighting factor]] ''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue, is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose.  The result is given the unit sievert.

The equivalent dose is calculated by multiplying the absorbed energy, averaged by mass over an organ or tissue of interest, by a radiation weighting factor appropriate to the type and energy of radiation. To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy dose.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_T = \sum_R W_R \cdot D_{T,R}\ &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue ''T''
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorbed dose in tissue ''T'' by radiation type ''R''
:''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1&amp;nbsp;Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20&amp;nbsp;Sv.

[[File:Neutron radiation weighting factor as a function of kinetic energy.gif|thumb|300px|The radiation weighting factor for neutrons has been revised over time and remains controversial.]]

This may seem to be a paradox. It implies that the energy of the incident radiation field in [[joule]]s has increased by a factor of 20, thereby violating the laws of [[Conservation of energy]]. However, this is not the case. The sievert is used only to convey the fact that a gray of absorbed alpha particles would cause twenty times the biological effect of a gray of absorbed x-rays. It is this biological component that is being expressed when using sieverts rather than the actual energy delivered by the incident absorbed radiation.

===Tissue type weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;===

{{Main article|effective dose (radiation)}}
The second weighting factor is the tissue factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, but it is used only if there has been non-uniform irradiation of a body. If the body has been subject to uniform irradiation, the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose, and only the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is used. But if there is partial or non-uniform body irradiation the calculation must take account of the individual organ doses received, because the sensitivity of each organ to irradiation depends on their tissue type. This summed dose from only those organs concerned gives the effective dose for the whole body. The tissue weighting factor is used to calculate those individual organ dose contributions.

The ICRP values for ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; are given in the table shown here.

The article on [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] gives the method of calculation. The absorbed dose is first corrected for the radiation type to give the equivalent dose, and then corrected for the tissue receiving the radiation. Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

In summary, the sum of tissue-weighted doses to each irradiated organ or tissue of the body adds up to the effective dose for the body. The use of effective dose enables comparisons of overall dose received regardless of the extent of body irradiation.

==Operational quantities==
The operational quantities are used in practical applications for monitoring and investigating external exposure situations. They are defined for practical operational measurements and assessment of doses in the body.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;  Three external operational dose quantities were devised to relate operational dosimeter and instrument measurements to the calculated protection quantities. Also devised were two phantoms, The ICRU "slab" and "sphere" phantoms which relate these quantities to incident radiation quantities using the Q(L) calculation.

===Ambient dose equivalent===
This is used for area monitoring of penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H''*(10). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found 10&amp;nbsp;mm within the ICRU sphere phantom in the direction of origin of the field.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B163 - B164&lt;/ref&gt; An example of penetrating radiation is [[gamma ray]]s.

===Directional dose equivalent===
This is used for monitoring of low penetrating radiation and is usually expressed as the quantity ''H'''(0.07). This means the radiation is equivalent to that found at a depth of 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm in the ICRU sphere phantom.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B165- B167&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of low penetrating radiation are alpha particles, beta particles and low-energy photons. This dose quantity is used for the determination of equivalent dose to such as the skin, lens of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Mattsson |first1=Sören |last2=Söderberg |first2=Marcus |title=Radiation Protection in Nuclear Medicine |chapter=Dose Quantities and Units for Radiation Protection |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642311666-c2.pdf |publisher=Springer Verlag |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31167-3 |isbn=978-3-642-31166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In radiological protection practice value of omega is usually not specified as the dose is usually at a maximum at the point of interest.

===Personal dose equivalent===
This is used for individual dose monitoring, such as with a personal dosimeter worn on the body. The recommended depth for assessment is 10&amp;nbsp;mm which gives the quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(10).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 paragraphs B168 - B170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals for changing the definition of protection dose quantities==
In order to simplify the means of calculating operational quantities, and assist in the comprehension of radiation dose protection quantities, ICRP Committee 2 &amp; ICRU Report Committee 26 started in 2010 an examination of different means of achieving this by dose coefficients related to Effective Dose or Absorbed Dose.

Specifically;

1. For area monitoring of effective dose of whole body it would be:

''H'' = Φ × conversion coefficient

The driver for this is that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(10) is not a reasonable estimate of effective dose due to high energy photons, as a result of the extension of particle types and energy ranges to be considered in ICRP report 116. This change would remove the need for the ICRU sphere and introduce a new quantity called ''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;

2. For individual monitoring, to measure deterministic effects on eye lens and skin, it would be:

''D'' = Φ × conversion coefficient for absorbed dose.

The driver for this is the need to measure the deterministic effect, which it is suggested, is more appropriate than stochastic effect. This would calculate equivalent dose quantities ''H''&lt;sub&gt;lens&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;skin&lt;/sub&gt;.

This would remove the need for the ICRU Sphere and the Q-L function. Any changes would replace ICRU report 51, and part of report 57.&lt;ref name= "endo"&gt;"Operational Quantities and new approach by ICRU" – Akira Endo. The 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection, Seoul, Korea – October 20–22, 2015 [http://www.icrp.org/docs/icrp2015/18%20Akira%20Endo%202015.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A final draft report was issued in July 2017 by ICRU/ICRP for consultation. &lt;ref&gt;ICRP draft "Operational Quantities for External Radiation Exposure" [http://www.icrp.org/docs/ICRU%20and%20ICRP%20Draft%20Joint%20Report%20Operational%20Quantities%20for%20External%20Radiation%20Exposure.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal dose quantities==
{{Main article|Committed dose}}
The sievert is used for human internal dose quantities in calculating [[committed dose]]. This is dose from radionuclides which have been ingested or inhaled into the human body, and thereby "committed" to irradiate the body for a period of time. The concepts of calculating protection quantities as described for external radiation applies, but as the source of radiation is within the tissue of the body, the calculation of absorbed organ dose uses different coefficients and irradiation mechanisms.

The ICRP defines Committed effective dose, E(''t'') as the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt;

The ICRP further states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

A committed dose from an internal source is intended to carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of effective dose applied to part of the body.

==Health effects==
Ionizing radiation has [[deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] effects on human health. Deterministic (acute tissue effect) events happen with certainty, with the resulting health conditions occurring in every individual who received the same high dose.  [[Stochastic]] (cancer induction and genetic) events are inherently [[random]], with most individuals in a group failing to ever exhibit any [[causal]] negative health effects after exposure, while an indeterministic random minority do, often with the resulting subtle negative health effects being observable only after large detailed [[epidemiology]] studies.

The use of the sievert implies that only stochastic effects are being considered, and to avoid confusion deterministic effects are conventionally compared to values of absorbed dose expressed by the SI unit gray (Gy).

===Stochastic effects===
Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. The consensus of nuclear regulators, governments and the [[UNSCEAR]] is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per sievert.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;  This is known as the [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT model). Some commentators such as the French Academy of Sciences (2005, ''Dose-effect relationships and...''Tubiana, M. and Aurengo, A.  Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie Nationale de Médecine. (2005) www.researchgate.net/publication/277289357) and Oxford University (Wade Allison, 2015, Nuclear is for Life, pp79–80, {{ISBN|978-0-9562756-4-6}}) argue that this LNT model is now outdated and should be replaced with a threshold below which the body's natural cell processes repair damage and/or replace damaged cells. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peck |first=Donald J. |title=How to Understand and Communicate Radiation Risk |url=http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208060102/http://www.imagewisely.org/Imaging-Professionals/Medical-Physicists/Articles/How-to-Understand-and-Communicate-Radiation-Risk.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 December 2010 |publisher=Image Wisely |accessdate=18 May 2012 |last2=Samei |first2=Ehsan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR"&gt;{{cite book |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Effects of ionizing radiation: UNSCEAR 2006 report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes |year=2008 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=978-92-1-142263-4 |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html |accessdate=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic effects===

The blue line is for cells which were not given a chance to recover; the radiation was delivered in one session, the red line is for cells which were allowed to stand for a time and recover. With the pause in delivery conferring [[radioresistance]].]]
The deterministic (acute tissue damage) effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of acute high doses (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h) and are conventionally not measured using the unit sievert, but use the unit gray (Gy).
A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose.

===ICRP dose limits===

The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of report 103. These limits are "situational", for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for the following groups;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Table 8, section 6.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public 
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – All persons exposed

For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period, and for the public to an average of 1&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.&lt;ref name="ICRP103" /&gt;

For comparison, natural radiation levels inside the US [[United States Capitol|capitol building]] are such that a human body would receive an additional dose rate of 0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the [[granite]] structure.&lt;ref name="FUSRAP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program |title=Radiation in the Environment |url=http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211162419/http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/fusrap/docs/fusrap-fs-radenvironment-2008-09.pdf |archive-date=11 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conservative ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk (calculated as: 20&amp;nbsp;a·0.85&amp;nbsp;mSv/a·0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv/mSv·5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%). However, that "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a 10% chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation (see natural [[Epidemiology of cancer]] and [[cancer rates]]).  These estimates are, however, unmindful of every living cell's natural repair mechanisms, evolved over a few billion years of exposure to environmental chemical and radiation threats that were higher in the past, and exaggerated by the evolution of [[oxygen metabolism]].

Significant radiation doses are not frequently encountered in everyday life. The following examples can help illustrate relative magnitudes; these are meant to be examples only, not a comprehensive list of possible radiation doses. An "acute dose" is one that occurs over a short and finite period of time, while a "chronic dose" is a dose that continues for an extended period of time so that it is better described by a dose rate.

==History==
The sievert has its origin in the [[roentgen equivalent man|röntgen equivalent man]] (rem) which was derived from [[CGS units]]. The [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) promoted a switch to coherent SI units in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=Round table on SI units: ICRU Activities |conference=International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association |date=April 1977 |url=http://www.irpa.net/irpa4/cdrom/VOL.2/P2_101.PDF |accessdate=18 May 2012 |location=Paris, France }}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in 1976 that it planned to formulate a suitable unit for equivalent dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyckoff |first=H. O. |title=The New Special Names of SI Units in the Field of Ionizing Radiations |journal=British Journal of Radiology |date=May 1976 |volume=49 |pages=476–477 |url=http://bjr.birjournals.org/content/49/581/476.2.full.pdf |accessdate=18 May 2012 |issn=1748-880X |pmid=949584 |last2=Allisy |first2=A. |last3=Lidén |first3=K. |issue=581 |doi=10.1259/0007-1285-49-581-476-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICRP pre-empted the ICRU by introducing the sievert in 1977.&lt;ref name="ICRP26"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recommendations of the ICRP |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=1977 |volume=1 |series=ICRP publication 26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%2026 |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sievert was adopted by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 1980, five years after adopting the gray. The CIPM then issued an explanation in 1984, recommending when the sievert should be used as opposed to the gray. That explanation was updated in 2002 to bring it closer to the ICRP's definition of equivalent dose, which had changed in 1990. Specifically, the ICRP had introduced equivalent dose, renamed the quality factor (Q) to radiation weighting factor (W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), and dropped another weighting factor 'N' in 1990. In 2002, the CIPM similarly dropped the weighting factor 'N' from their explanation but otherwise kept other old terminology and symbols. This explanation only appears in the appendix to the SI brochure and is not part of the definition of the sievert.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{SIbrochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common SI usage==
{{SI unit lowercase|Rolf Maximilian Sievert|sievert|Sv}}

Frequently used [[SI prefixes]] are the millisievert (1&amp;nbsp;mSv = 0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and microsievert (1&amp;nbsp;μSv = 0.000001&amp;nbsp;Sv) and commonly used units for [[time derivative]] or "dose rate" indications on instruments and warnings for radiological protection are μSv/h and mSv/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mSv/a or Sv/a, where they are understood to represent an average over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual limits. The conversion from hours to years varies because of leap years and exposure schedules, but approximate conversions are:

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 8.766&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 114.1&amp;nbsp;μSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

Conversion from hourly rates to annual rates is further complicated by seasonal fluctuations in natural radiation, decay of artificial sources, and intermittent proximity between humans and sources. The ICRP once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units |year=1950 |publisher=US Department of Commerce |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2012 |series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook |volume=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 8&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;day
: 40&amp;nbsp;h = 1&amp;nbsp;week
: 50&amp;nbsp;weeks = 1&amp;nbsp;year

Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,

: 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/h = 2&amp;nbsp;Sv/a
: 500&amp;nbsp;µSv/h = 1&amp;nbsp;Sv/a

==Ionizing radiation quantities==

{{Radiation related quantities}}

Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units [[curie]], [[rad (unit)|rad]], and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1004|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]] [[European units of measurement directives]] required that their use for "public health ... purposes" be phased out by 31 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Space vector modulation''' ('''SVM''') is an algorithm for the control of [[pulse width modulation]] (PWM).&lt;ref name=control&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the creation of [[alternating current]] (AC) [[waveform]]s; most commonly to drive [[3 phase]] AC powered motors at varying speeds from DC using multiple [[Switching amplifier|class-D amplifiers]]. There are variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.

==Principle==

[[File:Three leg inverter.gif|240px|thumb|right|Topology of a basic three phase inverter.]]

A three-phase inverter as shown to the right converts a DC supply, via a series of switches, to three output legs which could be connected to a three-phase motor.

The switches must be controlled so that at no time are both switches in the same leg turned on or else the DC supply would be shorted. This requirement may be met by the complementary operation of the switches within a leg. i.e. if A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is on then A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is off and vice versa. This leads to eight possible switching vectors for the inverter, V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through V&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; with six active switching vectors and two zero vectors.

Note that looking down the columns for the active switching vectors V&lt;sub&gt;1-6&lt;/sub&gt;, the output voltages vary as a pulsed sinusoid, with each leg offset by 120 degrees of [[Phasor (electronics)|phase angle]].

To implement space vector modulation, a reference signal V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is sampled with a frequency f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;). The reference signal may be generated from three separate phase references using the [[Alpha beta gamma transform|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform]]. The reference vector is then synthesized using a combination of the two adjacent active switching vectors and one or both of the zero vectors. Various strategies of selecting the order of the vectors and which zero vector(s) to use exist. Strategy selection will affect the harmonic content and the switching losses.

More complicated SVM strategies for the unbalanced operation of four-leg three-phase inverters do exist. In these strategies the switching vectors define a 3D shape (a hexagonal [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] in &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; coordinates&lt;ref&gt;R. Zhang, V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37332">{{distinguish|Statistical interference}}

'''Statistical inference''' is the process of using [[data analysis]] to deduce properties of an underlying [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) ''Oxford Dictionary of Statistics'', OUP. {{isbn|978-0-19-954145-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a [[Statistical population|population]], for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is [[Sampling (statistics)|sampled]] from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with [[descriptive statistics]]. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

== Introduction ==
Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) [[Model selection|selecting]] a [[statistical model]] of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state, "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling".&lt;ref&gt;Konishi &amp; Kitagawa (2008), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] of a statistical inference is a statistical [[proposition]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following:
* a [[point estimate]], i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest; 
* an [[interval estimate]], e.g. a [[confidence interval]] (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the [[frequency probability|probability]] at the stated [[confidence level]];
* a [[credible intervals|credible interval]], i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;
* rejection of a [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]];{{efn|According to Peirce, acceptance means that inquiry on this question ceases for the time being. In science, all scientific theories are revisable.}}
* [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] or [[Statistical classification|classification]] of data points into groups.

==Models and assumptions==
{{Main|Statistical model|Statistical assumptions}}
Any statistical inference requires some assumptions. A '''statistical model''' is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference.&lt;ref name=Cox2006&gt;Cox (2006) page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Evans|first=Michael|title=Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty|year=2004|publisher=Freeman and Company|page=267|display-authors=etal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkWK8kFzXWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22descriptive%20statistics%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780716747420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of models/assumptions===
Statisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions;
* '''[[Parametric model|Fully parametric]]''': The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters.&lt;ref name=Cox2006/&gt; For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]]. The family of [[Generalized linear model#Model components|generalized linear models]] is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.
* '''[[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|Non-parametric]]''': The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;van der Vaart, A.W. (1998) ''Asymptotic Statistics''  Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-78450-6}} (page 341)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the [[Hodges–Lehmann estimator|Hodges–Lehmann–Sen estimator]], which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.
* '''[[Semiparametric model|Semi-parametric]]''': This term typically implies assumptions 'in between' fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any [[heteroscedasticity]]). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into 'structural' and 'random variation' components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known [[Cox model]] is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.

===Importance of valid models/assumptions===
Whatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.

Incorrect assumptions of [[Simple random sample|'simple' random sampling]] can invalidate statistical inference.&lt;ref&gt;Kruskal 1988&lt;/ref&gt; More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David A. Freedman|Freedman, D.A.]] (2008) "Survival analysis: An Epidemiological hazard?". ''The American Statistician'' (2008) 62: 110-119. (Reprinted as Chapter 11 (pages 169–192) of Freedman (2010)).&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrect assumptions of Normality in the population also invalidates some forms of regression-based inference.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, R. (2003) ''Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique (Advanced Quantitative Techniques in the Social Sciences) (v. 11)'' Sage Publications. {{isbn|0-7619-2904-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of '''any''' parametric model is viewed skeptically by most experts in sampling human populations:  "most sampling statisticians, when they deal with confidence intervals at all, limit themselves to statements about [estimators] based on very large samples, where the central limit theorem ensures that these [estimators] will have distributions that are nearly normal."&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Brewer| title=Combined Survey Sampling Inference: Weighing of Basu's Elephants| publisher=Hodder Arnold|page=6|year= 2002|isbn=978-0340692295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a normal distribution "would be a totally unrealistic and catastrophically unwise assumption to make if we were dealing with any kind of economic population."&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt; Here, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean "for very large samples" is approximately normally distributed, if the distribution is not heavy tailed.

====Approximate distributions====
{{Main|Statistical distance|Asymptotic theory (statistics)|Approximation theory}}

Given the difficulty in specifying exact distributions of sample statistics, many methods have been developed for approximating these.

With finite samples, [[approximation theory|approximation results]] measure how close a limiting distribution approaches the statistic's [[sample distribution]]: For example, with 10,000 independent samples the [[normal distribution]] approximates (to two digits of accuracy) the distribution of the [[sample mean]] for many population distributions, by the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]].&lt;ref name=JHJ&gt;
Jörgen Hoffman-Jörgensen's ''Probability With a View Towards Statistics'', Volume I. Page 399 {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet for many practical purposes, the normal approximation provides a good approximation to the sample-mean's distribution when there are 10 (or more) independent samples, according to simulation studies and statisticians' experience.&lt;ref name=JHJ/&gt; Following Kolmogorov's work in the 1950s, advanced statistics uses [[approximation theory]] and [[functional analysis]] to quantify the error of approximation. In this approach, the [[metric geometry]] of [[probability distribution]]s is studied; this approach quantifies approximation error with, for example, the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], [[Bregman divergence]], and the [[Hellinger distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Cam (1986) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Torgerson (1991) ''Comparison of Statistical Experiments'', volume 36 of Encyclopedia of Mathematics. Cambridge University Press. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

With indefinitely large samples, [[asymptotic theory (statistics)|limiting results]] like the [[central limit theorem]] describe the sample statistic's limiting distribution, if one exists. Limiting results are not statements about finite samples, and indeed are irrelevant to finite samples.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov (1963, p.369): "The frequency concept, &lt;!-- comma missing in original --&gt; based on the notion of limiting frequency as the number of trials increases to infinity, does not contribute anything to substantiate the applicability of the results of probability theory to real practical problems where we have always to deal with a finite number of trials".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, limit theorems 'as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity' are logically devoid of content about what happens at any particular&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. All they can do is suggest certain approaches whose performance must then be checked on the case at hand." &amp;mdash; Le Cam (1986) (page xiv)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994): "The crucial drawback of asymptotic theory: What we expect from asymptotic theory are results which hold approximately . . . . What asymptotic theory has to offer are limit theorems."(page ix) "What counts for applications are approximations, not limits." (page 188)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the asymptotic theory of limiting distributions is often invoked for work with finite samples. For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the [[generalized method of moments]] and the use of [[generalized estimating equation]]s, which are popular in [[econometrics]] and [[biostatistics]]. The magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution (formally, the 'error' of the approximation) can be assessed using simulation&lt;!-- and approximation results --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1994) : "By taking a limit theorem as being approximately true for large sample sizes, we commit an error the size of which is unknown. [. . .] Realistic information about the remaining errors may be obtained by simulations." (page ix)
&lt;/ref&gt; The heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications, especially with low-dimensional [[statistical model|models]] with [[logarithmically concave function|log-concave]] [[likelihood function|likelihood]]s (such as with one-parameter [[exponential families]]).

===Randomization-based models===
{{Main|Randomization}}
{{See also|Random sample|Random assignment}}

For a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design, the randomization distribution of a statistic (under the null-hypothesis) is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design. In frequentist inference, randomization allows inferences to be based on the randomization distribution rather than a subjective model, and this is important especially in survey sampling and design of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman, J.]](1934) "On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', 97 (4), 557&amp;ndash;625 {{jstor|2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne(2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical inference from randomized studies is also more straightforward than many other situations.&lt;ref&gt;ASA Guidelines for a first course in statistics for non-statisticians. (available at the ASA website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman]] et alia's ''Statistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore et al. (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bayesian inference]], randomization is also of importance: in [[survey sampling]], use of [[sampling without replacement]] ensures the [[exchangeability]] of the sample with the population; in randomized experiments, randomization warrants a [[missing at random]] assumption for [[covariate]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gelman|Gelman A.]] et al. (2013). ''Bayesian Data Analysis'' ([[Chapman &amp; Hall]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a good observational study may be better than a bad randomized experiment.

The statistical analysis of a randomized experiment may be based on the randomization scheme stated in the experimental protocol and does not need a subjective model.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman, Jerzy. 1923 [1990]. "On the Application of Probability Theory to AgriculturalExperiments. Essay on Principles. Section 9." ''Statistical Science'' 5 (4): 465–472. Trans. [[Dorota Dabrowska|Dorota M. Dabrowska]] and Terence P. Speed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann &amp; Kempthorne (2008) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at any time, some hypotheses cannot be tested using objective statistical models, which accurately describe randomized experiments or random samples. In some cases, such randomized studies are uneconomical or unethical.

====Model-based analysis of randomized experiments====
It is standard practice to refer to a statistical model, often a linear model, when analyzing data from randomized experiments. However, the randomization scheme guides the choice of a statistical model. It is not possible to choose an appropriate model without knowing the randomization scheme.&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann and Kempthorne"/&gt; Seriously misleading results can be obtained analyzing data from randomized experiments while ignoring the experimental protocol; common mistakes include forgetting the blocking used in an experiment and confusing repeated measurements on the same experimental unit with independent replicates of the treatment applied to different experimental units.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008) Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms for inference==

Different schools of statistical inference have become established. These schools&amp;mdash;or "paradigms"&amp;mdash;are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.

Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster&lt;ref&gt;Bandyopadhyay &amp; Forster (2011). The quote is taken from the book's Introduction (p.3).  See also "Section&amp;nbsp;III: Four Paradigms of Statistics".&lt;/ref&gt;  describe four paradigms: "(i) classical statistics or error statistics, (ii) Bayesian statistics, (iii) likelihood-based statistics, and (iv) the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based statistics".  The classical (or [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]]) paradigm, the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] paradigm, and the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]]-based paradigm are summarized below.  The likelihood-based paradigm is essentially a sub-paradigm of the AIC-based paradigm.

===Frequentist inference===
{{See also|Frequentist inference}}

This paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset's characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified—although in practice this quantification may be challenging.

====Examples of frequentist inference====

* [[p-value|''p''-value]]
* [[Confidence interval]]

====Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory====

One interpretation of [[frequentist inference]] (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of [[frequency probability]]; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jerzy Neyman | year = 1937 | title = Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability | jstor = 91337 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 236 | issue = 767| pages = 333–380 | doi=10.1098/rsta.1937.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.

The frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to [[utility function]]s. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as [[statistical decision theory]], do incorporate [[utility function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]s, or [[uniformly most powerful test]]ing) make use of [[loss function]]s, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Pfanzagl.&lt;/ref&gt; However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under [[absolute value]] loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and [[least squares]] estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.

While statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the [[estimators]]/[[Test statistic#Common test statistics|test statistic]] to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as 'objective'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Bayesian inference===
{{See also|Bayesian Inference}}

The Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the 'language' of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate to one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are [[Bayesian probability#Justification of Bayesian probabilities|several different justifications]] for using the Bayesian approach.

====Examples of Bayesian inference====

* [[Credible interval]] for [[interval estimation]]
* [[Bayes factor]]s for model comparison

====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====

Many informal Bayesian inferences are based on "intuitively reasonable" summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user's [[utility function]] need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been [[Bayesian probability#Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors|proposed]] but not yet fully developed.)

Formally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the 'Bayes rule' is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides [[optimal decision]]s in a [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) [[Coherence (statistics)|incoherent]]; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be [[Coherence (statistics)|coherent]]. Some advocates of [[Bayesian inference]] assert that inference ''must'' take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that [[Bayesian inference]] should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.

===AIC-based inference===
{{Main|Akaike information criterion}}
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
The ''[[Akaike information criterion]]'' (AIC) is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

===Other paradigms for inference===

====Minimum description length====
{{Main|Minimum description length}}

The minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in [[information theory]]&lt;ref name="Soofi 2000 1349–1353"&gt;Soofi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name=HY&gt;Hansen &amp; Yu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable "data-generating mechanisms" or [[probability models]] for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.

However, if a "data generating mechanism" does exist in reality, then according to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s [[source coding theorem]] it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically.&lt;ref name=HY747&gt;Hansen and Yu (2001), page 747.&lt;/ref&gt; In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to [[maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[maximum a posteriori estimation]] (using [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum-entropy]] [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian priors]]). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.&lt;ref name=HY747/&gt;&lt;ref name=JR&gt;Rissanen (1989), page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDL principle has been applied in communication-[[coding theory]] in [[information theory]], in [[linear regression]],&lt;ref name=JR/&gt; and in [[data mining]].&lt;ref name=HY/&gt;

The evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from [[computational complexity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Traub, G. W. Wasilkowski, and H. Wozniakowski. (1988) {{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiducial inference====
{{Main|Fiducial inference}}
[[Fiducial inference]] was an approach to statistical inference based on [[fiducial probability]], also known as a "fiducial distribution". In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability,  and even fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;Neyman (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zabell (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However this argument is the same as that which shows&lt;ref&gt;Cox (2006) page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  that a so-called [[confidence distribution]] is not a valid [[probability distribution]] and, since this has not invalidated the application of [[confidence interval]]s, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments. An attempt was made to reinterpret the early work of Fisher's [[Fiducial probability|fiducial argument]] as a special case of an inference theory using [[Upper and lower probabilities]].{{sfn|Hampel|2003}}

====Structural inference====

Developing ideas of Fisher and of Pitman from 1938 to 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Davison, page 12. {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George A. Barnard]] developed "structural inference" or "pivotal inference",&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, G.A. (1995) "Pivotal Models and the Fiducial Argument", International Statistical Review, 63 (3), 309–323. {{jstor|1403482}}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach using [[Haar measure|invariant probabilities]] on [[group family|group families]]. Barnard reformulated the arguments behind fiducial inference on a restricted class of models on which "fiducial" procedures would be well-defined and useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9642">'''Stellar mass''' is a phrase that is used by [[astronomer]]s to describe the mass of a [[star]]. It is usually enumerated in terms of the Sun's mass as a proportion of a [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}). Hence, the bright star [[Sirius]] has around {{Solar mass|2.02|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Liebert2005" /&gt; A star's mass will vary over its lifetime as additional mass becomes accreted, such as from a companion star, or mass is ejected with the [[stellar wind]] or pulsational behavior.

==Properties==
Stars are sometimes grouped by mass based upon their evolutionary behavior as they approach the end of their nuclear fusion lifetimes.

''Very low mass stars'' with masses below 0.5 {{Solar mass|link=yes}} do not enter the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) but evolve directly into white dwarfs. (At least in theory; the lifetimes of such stars are long enough—longer than the age of the universe to date—that none has yet had time to evolve to this point and be observed.)

''Low mass stars'' with a mass below about 1.8–2.2 {{Solar mass}} (depending on composition) do enter the AGB, where they develop a degenerate helium core.

''Intermediate-mass stars'' undergo [[helium fusion]] and develop a degenerate [[Carbon-burning_process|carbon-oxygen]] core.

''Massive stars'' have a minimum mass of 7–10 {{Solar mass}}, but this may be as low as 5–6 {{Solar mass}}. These stars undergo [[Carbon burning process|carbon fusion]], with their lives ending in a core-collapse [[supernova]] explosion.&lt;ref name=kwok2000/&gt; [[Black hole]]s created as a result of a stellar collapse are termed [[stellar mass black hole]]s.

The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the [[absorption line]]s.&lt;ref name="new cosmos" /&gt;

==Range==
One of the most massive stars known is [[Eta Carinae]],&lt;ref name=smith1998/&gt; with {{Solar mass|100–150|link=yes}}; its lifespan is very short—only several million years at most. A study of the [[Arches cluster]] suggests that {{Solar mass|150}} is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.&lt;ref name=nasa20050303/&gt; The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the [[Eddington luminosity]] which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named [[R136a1]] in the RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 {{Solar mass}}, putting this limit into question.&lt;ref name=eso20100721/&gt; A study has determined that stars larger than 150 {{Solar mass}} in [[R136]] were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close [[binary star|binary systems]], providing a way to sidestep the 150 {{Solar mass}} limit.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/mystery-monster-stars-solved-monster-mash-161251348.html?_esi=1 "Mystery of the 'Monster Stars' Solved: It Was a Monster Mash"], Natalie Wolchover, 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 {{Solar mass}} or more,&lt;ref name=hsca20050922/&gt; due to the complete absence of elements heavier than [[lithium]] in their composition. This generation of supermassive, [[population III stars]] is long extinct, however, and currently only theoretical.

With a mass only 93&amp;nbsp;times that of [[Jupiter]] ({{Jupiter mass|link=yes}}), or .09 {{Solar mass}}, [[AB Doradus|AB Doradus C]], a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.&lt;ref name=eso20050101/&gt; For stars with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref name=boss20010403/&gt;&lt;ref name="minimum"/&gt; When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref name="minimum" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc20060818/&gt; Smaller bodies are called [[brown dwarf]]s, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and [[gas giant]]s.

==Change==
In the present day, the Sun is losing mass from the emission of electromagnetic energy and by the ejection of matter with the [[solar wind]]. It is expelling about (2&amp;ndash;3){{e|-14}} {{Solar mass|link=yes}} per year.&lt;ref name=carroll_ostlie1995/&gt; The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the [[red giant]] stage, climbing to (7&amp;ndash;9){{e|−14}} {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; when it reaches the [[tip of the red giant branch]]. This will rise to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[asymptotic giant branch]], before peaking at a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the Sun generates a [[planetary nebula]]. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate [[white dwarf]], it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6819">'''Tank blanketing''', also referred to as tank padding, is the process of applying a [[gas]] to the empty space in a storage container. The term storage container here refers to any container that is used to store products, regardless of its size. Though tank blanketing is used for a variety of reasons, it typically involves using a [[buffer gas]] to protect products inside the storage container. A few of the benefits of blanketing include a longer life of the product in the container, reduced hazards, and longer equipment life cycles.

==Methods==
In 1970, Appalachian Controls Environmental (ACE) was the world’s first company to introduce a [[storage tank|tank]] blanketing [[valve]]. There are now many ready-made systems available for purchase from a variety of process equipment companies. It is also possible to piece together your own system using a variety of different equipment. Regardless of which method is used, the basic requirements are the same.  There must be a way of allowing the blanketing gas into the system, and a way to vent the gas should the [[pressure]] get too high.

Since ACE introduced its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though many of the products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point.  This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas at a much higher than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure reducing valve to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.

Although it varies from application to application, blanketing systems usually operate at a slightly higher than atmospheric pressure (a few inches of [[pressure#Stagnation pressure|water column]] above [[atmospheric pressure|atmospheric]]). Higher pressures than this are generally not used as they often yield only marginal increases in results while wasting large amounts of expensive blanketing gas.

Some systems also utilize inert gases to agitate the liquid contents of the container. This is desirable because products, such as citric acid, are added to food oils the tank will begin to settle over time with the heavier contents sinking to the bottom. However, a system that utilizes nitrogen [[sparging (chemistry)|sparging]] (and then subsequently tank blanketing once the nitrogen reaches the vapor space) may have negative impact on the products involved. Nitrogen sparging creates a significantly higher amount of surface contact between the gas and the product, which in turn creates a much larger opportunity for undesired oxidation to occur. It is possible for nitrogen that is as much 99.9% free of oxygen to increase the amount of oxidation within the product due to the high amount of surface contact.

==Common practices==
The most common gas used in blanketing is [[nitrogen]]. Nitrogen is widely used due to its inert properties, as well as its availability and relatively low cost. Tank blanketing is used for a variety of products including [[cooking oil]]s, volatile [[combustion|combustible]] products, and [[purified water]]. These applications also cover a wide variety of storage containers, ranging from as large as a tank containing millions of gallons of vegetable oil down to a quart-size container or smaller. Nitrogen is appropriate for use at any of these scales.

The use of an inert blanketing gas for food products helps to keep [[oxygen]] levels low in and around the product. Low levels of oxygen surrounding the product help to reduce the amount of oxidation that may occur, and increases shelf life.  In the case of cooking oils, lipid [[redox|oxidation]] can cause the oil to change its [[color]], [[flavor]], or [[aroma]]. It also decreases the [[nutrient]] levels in the food and can even generate [[toxicity|toxic]] substances. Tank blanketing strategies are also implemented to prepare the product for transit ([[railcar]] or [[truck]]) and for final [[packaging]] before sealing the product.

When considering the application for combustible products, the greatest benefit is process safety. Since fuels require oxygen to combust, reduced oxygen content in the vapor space lowers the risk of unwanted combustion.

Tank blanketing is also used to keep contaminants out of a storage space. This is accomplished by creating positive pressure inside the container. This positive pressure ensures that if a leak should occur, the gas will leak out rather than having the contaminants infiltrate the container. Some examples include its use on purified water to keep unwanted minerals out and its use on food products to keep contaminants out.

To ensure their safety, gas-blanketing systems for food use are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and must adhere to strict maintenance schedules and follow all product-contact regulations with regards to purity, toxicity, and filter specs. As with any use of inert gases, care must be taken to ensure that workers are not exposed to large quantities of nitrogen or other non-breathable substances, which can quickly result in [[nitrogen asphyxiation|asphyxiation]] and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianeng.com/inertgas.html] Reference Data Sheet on Inert Gases and Atmospheres, by Richard Gullickson, CIH&lt;/ref&gt; Use of them in commercial applications is subject to the regulation of [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] in the USA and similar regulatory bodies elsewhere.

"'''Teddy'''" is a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]], completed on November 22, 1952 and originally published in the January 31, 1953
issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', Salinger created an engaging child character, Teddy McArdle, to introduce to his readership some of the basic concepts of [[Zen]] enlightenment and [[Vedanta]] reincarnation – a task that Salinger recognized would require overcoming some 1950s American cultural chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "In 1952, most Americans thought their way of life superior to that of Eastern cultures. Salinger was well aware of this chauvinism. It was clear to him that his reading audience was not going to accept the notions of mysticism or reincarnation easily."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger wrote "Teddy" while he was arranging publication for a number of his [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|short stories]] and crafted the story to balance and contrast the collections' intended opening work "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]".&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;

In Salinger's novella, "[[Seymour: An Introduction]]", a meditation written by a member of the fictional Glass family, [[Buddy Glass]] writes about his brother, [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], where Buddy claims authorship to "Teddy" as well as other pieces in ''Nine Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;Wenke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The story comprises several vignettes which take place aboard a luxury liner. The events occur roughly between 10:00 and 10:30 am on October 28, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teddy is Theodore "Teddy" McArdle, a 10-year-old mystic-savant returning home to America with his entertainer-socialite parents and his younger sister. As part of their tour of [[Great Britain]], Teddy has been interviewed as an academic curiosity by professors of religious and philosophical studies - the "Leidekker examining group" - from various European universities in order to test his claims of advanced spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first scene opens in the McArdles' stateroom. Teddy is standing on his father’s expensive suitcase, peering out of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "His father, a bellicose actor and not in the best of moods, struggles to assert his authority over his child. Teddy’s mother lies under the covers in bed, taunting her husband and listlessly issuing commands to Teddy in an attempt to irritate his father."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates the nature of existence and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from [[Zen]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to his father and mother, they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.

Teddy is ordered to retrieve his six-year-old sister, Booper, who has absconded to the sport deck with her father’s expensive camera, which Teddy -  indifferent to its material value -  has bestowed upon her as a plaything. 
As he departs, Teddy delivers a short, cryptic caveat to his parents, informing them that they may never see him again outside the realm of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Main Deck, Teddy has a brief encounter with one of the ship's female officers, Ensign Mathewson. Forthright and exacting,  the boy questions the officer and obtains information about a shipboard word game competition - and disabuses the bemused woman as to her misapprehensions regarding his advanced intellectual development.

Teddy proceeds to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts the girl to return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.

The final scene takes place on the Sun Deck, where Teddy, reclining on one of his family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following ''non sequitur'': “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen. It is ridiculous to mention it even.”

Teddy is interrupted by a passenger named Bob Nicholson, a graduate of an unnamed university, who teaches curriculum and instruction. Nicholson is on a first name basis with the Leidekker group and has listened to a taped interview with Teddy, in which he shows a lurid interest. He peppers Teddy with questions on the boy’s commitment to the precepts of Vedantic reincarnation; Teddy remains composed in the face of the young man’s veiled hostility, and provides him with a brief sketch of this discovery of God, his relationships with his parents and his views on Zen philosophy. The boy offers Nicholson an extended metaphor on the nature of logic that challenges the young man’s rational and orthodox commitment to material reality. Teddy, in explaining his position on death and reincarnation gives a hypothetical example describing a series of events at his upcoming swimming lesson in which a fatality occurs: his own.

Teddy disengages from the interview and hurries to his lesson. Nicholson pursues him through the levels of the ship's decks, and as he begins to descend the stairs to the swimming pool, he hears the scream of "a small, female child" emanating from the enclosed walls of the indoor pool. The story ends on this ambiguous note.

==Analysis==

===The porthole and the orange peel===

In the opening scene set in the Mr. and Mrs. McArdle's state room, Salinger presents two facets of Zen enlightenment: "God-consciousness", a profound awareness of "inner spirit", in contrast to material concerns, and secondly, "the notion of impermanence", based on "the Vedantic belief that separate existence is an illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy, perched on a piece of luggage, pokes his head through the open porthole, penetrating figuratively into a zone of enlightenment and sublimity; his body remains in the cabin, where his parents – “materialistic and self-centered” – engage in mildly abusive repartee, issuing petulant and ineffectual commands to their son, who endures them with tolerant detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy’s astonishing self-possession is a product of his adherence to Vedantic “philosophy of non-attachment”, enabling him to distinguish between “the world of illusion” – the material world – and “the world of reality”, where “only unity of God is real.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy focuses his attention on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “[[Solipsism|solipsistic]] contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this door, I may only exist in the minds of all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237: “It foreshadows the story’s ending…”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booper===

The same studied disengagement that characterizes Teddy’s relationship with his parents also informs the “amazing” toleration he exhibits toward his younger sister – a child that biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes as “a cruel little girl” and “perhaps the most vicious child ever discharged by Salinger’s imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booper announces that she “hates everybody in the ocean”, Salinger calls attention to the setting of his story: the sea, with its infinite horizons and indefinite boundaries where his characters drift – a seascape that reflects “the Zen and Vedantic concepts of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy’s tolerance of his sister is due to his understanding that few reincarnations have contributed to the six-year old’s spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238: “[Teddy] recognizes that  she has only just begun her spiritual journey and has many reincarnations ahead of her.”&lt;/ref&gt; Booper’s misanthropic persona make plausible her role in the sinister and unsettling denouement at the swimming  pool.

===Bob Nicholson===

The final vignette occurs on the Sun Deck. Bob Nicholson, a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, is acquainted with some members of the Leidekker group who examined Teddy; he engages the boy in an ''ad hoc'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238: “[Nicholson] imposes himself on Teddy and begins to pepper him with philosophical questions.”&lt;/ref&gt; This serves two purposes in Salinger’s story. First, he functions as a foil to Teddy,  posing logical questions challenging the tenets of Vendantic and Zen philosophy. Salinger uses this device to respond to hostile skeptics among his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p.238: “Nicholson’s character serves two purposes. Salinger uses him as a sounding board against which Teddy can express Vedantic and Zen viewpoints that Nicholson reacts to skeptically.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slawenski, Nicholson “embodies the logic that poisons God-consciousness, and he represents the power of the intellect to blind individuals from spiritual truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson additionally functions as a witness to Teddy’s final discourse on the nature of existence and death, in which the boy formulates the circumstances that might lead to his reincarnation. In a lull in their exchange, Teddy becomes momentarily distracted by an inner voice or vision, and spontaneously recites to Nicholson two haiku by the 17th Century poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]: “Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die” and “Along this road goes no one, this autumn eve.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson, pursuing Teddy to the indoor swimming pool, hears, but does not see, the event that the boy prophesied, providing the reader with tantalizing evidence that leaves the boy's ultimate fate a mystery.

===The "swimming pool ending"===

The ending of Salinger’s “Teddy” has been described as “controversial” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 1999,  p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; and “the most widely criticized ending of any story that he ever wrote.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger thrice provides the  reader with intimations of Teddy’s demise: in statements to his parents, in his diary and to Nicholson. This has led readers to interpret the final passage as confirmation of the boy’s premonition  i.e. Booper shoves her older brother into the empty concrete pool and screams when she sees the deadly consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239: “Most readers have interpreted the closing lines of “Teddy” as indicating Teddy’s death at the hand of Booper. This conclusion is derived from Teddy’s own predictions rather than the text itself.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Slawenski reports two additional interpretations that might be derived from the final passage. One option is that Teddy “recognizing the threat his sister poses” evades her thrust and pushes her to her death, as act of premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; A third option is that both children plunge into the empty basin when Teddy carries Booper with him off the precipice – in order to advance her into her next reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these" says Slawenski, "is very satisfying."

Critics of the story may have targeted the ending for disapproval, rather than engage in a culturally biased critique of Salinger’s foray into Zen philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240: “[T]he story's critics – many of whom found fault with in its Eastern tenets – conveniently delivered the brunt of disapproval to the story's ambiguous ending, rather than condemn cultural philosophies they did not understand.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger himself regarded the work as “exceptionally Haunting [sic]” and “memorable” yet “unpleasantly controversial” and “thoroughly unsuccessful.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6199">'''Theophilus Presbyter''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] c. 1070–1125) is the pseudonymous author or compiler of
a [[Latin]] text containing detailed descriptions of various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] arts, a text commonly known as the ''Schedula diversarum artium'' ("List of various arts") or ''De diversis artibus'' ("On various arts"), probably first compiled between 1100 and 1120. The oldest manuscript copies of the work are found in Vienna ([[Austrian National Library]], Codex 2527) and in [[Wolfenbüttel]] (Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. Gud. Lat. 69 2°). [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] rediscovered the document when he worked as librarian in Wolfenbüttel, and published excerpts in 1774.  These aroused great interest as they disproved [[Vasari]]'s myth of [[Jan van Eyck]] developing the technique of [[oil painting]] in the early 15th century, about which [[antiquaries]] had already become suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, Marc, "The Painter's Secret: Invention and Rivalry from Vasari to Balzac", p. 473, ''The Art Bulletin'' , Vol. 84, No. 3 (Sep., 2002), pp. 469–490, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177309 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus' ''Schedula'' allows detailed insights into the techniques used in the applied arts in the [[high Middle Ages]]. The work is divided into three books. The first covers the production and use of painting and drawing materials ([[painting#Painting techniques|painting techniques]], [[paint]]s, and [[ink]]), especially for [[illumination (manuscript)|illumination]] of texts and painting of walls. The second deals with the production of [[stained glass]] and techniques of glass painting, while the last deals with various techniques of [[jewellery|goldsmithing]] and other metalwork. It also includes an introduction into the building of [[organ (music)|organ]]s. Theophilus contains perhaps the earliest reference to [[oil paint]]. The work has been translated into English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Russian, mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries.

'Theophilus' was quite possibly a [[Benedictine]] monk. It has been suggested (particularly by [[Eckhard Freise]]) that Theophilus is the same person as the artisan monk [[Roger of Helmarshausen]]. Roger appears to have come from [[Stavelot Abbey]] in the [[Meuse River]] region, was active as an artist and author between 1100 and 1107 in [[St. Pantaleon]]'s church in [[Cologne]], and moved to [[Helmarshausen Abbey]] in 1107. The identity of the two men has been argued among researchers for some time, but Freise's conclusions have not yet been accepted by all researchers. Other suggestions have also been made, and at present there can not be said to be a consensus.&lt;ref name="HAB"&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-soz-u-kult&amp;month=1004&amp;week=c&amp;msg=LUbuR%2BKQguXvmNhWv6Hq3w&amp;user=&amp;pw=], "Around Theophilus": expert meeting, Wolfenbüttel 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus, as the author of a "handbook", has been described as a mere theorist, but this view is currently in the minority. The First Book, on painting, is not particularly well-informed, but adequately reliable, the Second, on glass, is better, while most of the Third Book is clearly the work of a practising metalworker. It has recently been suggested that the apparent contradictory evidence as to dating, practical experience, and location of 'Theophilus' is best explained if the ''Schedula'' is understood to be a compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’''. London: Archetype Publications: 56–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of California, Riverside''' ('''UCR''' or '''UC Riverside'''), is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] and one of the 10 general campuses of the [[University of California]] system. The main campus sits on {{convert|1900|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in a suburban district of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], California, United States, with a branch campus of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]]. In 1907 the predecessor to UCR was founded as the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]], Riverside which pioneered research in [[biological pest control]] and the use of [[plant hormone|growth regulators]] responsible for extending the [[citrus]] growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|citrus diversity]] and [[Entomology Research Museum|entomology]], as well as [[Eaton collection|science fiction]] and [[UCR/California Museum of Photography|photography]], are located at Riverside.

UCR's undergraduate [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|College of Letters and Science]] opened in 1954. The [[Regents of the University of California]] declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000&amp;nbsp;students by 2015, more than $730&amp;nbsp;million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999.&lt;ref name="UCR factsheet"&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Factsheet | url=https://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside | accessdate=2007-08-22| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070820032842/https://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html| archivedate = August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007"&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Facts and Impacts 2007| url=https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary accreditation of the [[UC Riverside School of Medicine]] granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013.

UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the [[Big West Conference]] of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of [[Box Springs Mountain]]. The UCR women's basketball team won back-to-back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.

In 2018, the university hired its first two Nobel Prize winners to its faculty. Richard Schrock and Barry Barish joined UCR's College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/55018|title=Nobel Laureate Barry Barish Joins UC Riverside Faculty|work=UCR Today|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Gary Anderson Graduate School of Managment.JPG|thumb|left|The original UC Citrus Experiment Station which now houses the [[A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management]] at the [[UCR School of Business Administration]].]]

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Southern California]] was a major producer of citrus, the region's primary [[export|agricultural export]]. The industry developed from the country's first [[navel orange]] trees, planted in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC [[Citrus Experiment Station]] (CES) on February 14, 1907, on {{convert|23|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} of land on the east slope of [[Mount Rubidoux]] in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in [[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop]] improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, {{convert|475|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} near Box Springs Mountain.&lt;ref name="citrus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruther |first=Walter |author2=E.

The 1944 passage of the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|GI Bill]] during [[World War II]] set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered [[liberal arts college]] next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman [[Philip L. Boyd]] and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite press release | title=University of California, Riverside Campus Timeline | url=http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | year=2002 | publisher=UCR News | accessdate=2008-01-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021017025918/http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | archivedate=2002-10-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gabbert Oral History transcript | url=http://www.ucrhistory.ucr.edu/pdf/gabbert.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California, Riverside, Oral History Project | date=1998-04-02 |accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Earl Warren]] signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2&amp;nbsp;million for initial campus construction.&lt;ref name="Lovekin"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lovekin | first=Kris | title= Enjoying Our Past | journal=Fiat Lux | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=14–17 | publisher= University of California, Riverside |date=February 2004 | url=http://www.fiatlux.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=583 | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Campus, occupying approximately {{convert|600|acre|ha|0|sp=us}}, hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the [[architecture]] of the major buildings followed the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt;

[[Image:Bell Tower, UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Carillon]] [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]] is the dominant landmark in the center of the main campus.]]
Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more [[Modern architecture|Modern]] style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a "general campus" of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east–west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt; The Bell Tower, one of only five [[carillon]]s in California, was built in this period. Designed by [[A. Quincy Jones]], the tower is {{convert|161|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and contains 48&amp;nbsp;bells, each weighing from {{convert|28|lb|kg}} to {{convert|5091|lb|kg}}, covering four chromatic [[octave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= History of the Bell Tower | publisher= UCR Bell Tower Fund | url= http://www.belltower.ucr.edu/subpage.php?content=history.html | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UCR Belltower night.JPG|thumb|UCR Bell Tower at night]]After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: [[UC Riverside Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering|Bourns Hall]], completed in 1995; the Humanities &amp; Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998.

UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Duties and Structure of the Academic Senate: A Brief Review, Academic Senate Office | publisher=University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure | accessdate=2008-01-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106102624/http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure| archivedate = November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The [[College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences]], founded in 1960, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974.&lt;ref name="Hinderaker" /&gt; UCR's newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title= UC Riverside College of Engineering Hires Thirteen New Faculty Members | url = http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=717 | date=2003-12-22 | publisher = University of California, Riverside | accessdate = 2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnas.ucr.edu/about/history.html|title=UCR College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, History|publisher=University of California, Riverside|accessdate=2008-03-12

[[College and university rankings|Institutional rankings]] of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, UC Riverside was ranked the #15 college in the United States by the Social Mobility Index college rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialmobilityindex.org/|title=2017 Social Mobility Index|publisher=CollegeNET|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018 edition of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'''s "America's Best Colleges", UCR was ranked tied for 85th among national universities; criteria include professor peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty resources, financial resources, and alumni giving.&lt;ref name="USNews"/&gt; In the 2018 edition of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' college rankings, UCR ranked 28th among national universities. ''Washington Monthly'' assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the 2018 edition of ''Webometrics Ranking of World Universities'' based in Spain, UCR was ranked 67th among national universities and 127th among world universities. ''Money'' magazine ranked UC Riverside 32nd in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2018 Best Colleges ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Money's Best Colleges |url=http://time.com/money/collection/moneys-best-colleges/ |publisher= Money|date=2018 |accessdate=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daily Beast ranked UC Riverside 153rd in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Daily Beast's Guide to the Best Colleges 2013 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/16/college-rankings-2013-daily-beast-guide-to-the-best-colleges.html |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]] published by ''Academic Analytics'' in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors.&lt;ref name="A New Standard for Measuring Doctoral Programs"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Fogg | first= Piper | title=A New Standard for Measuring Doctoral Programs | journal= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date= 2007-01-12 | url=http://chronicle.com/free/v53/i19/19a00801.htm | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, more than 110&amp;nbsp;UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Over the course of UCR's history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and more than 50 have received [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt;

===Economic and research impact===
UCR operated under a $435&amp;nbsp;million budget in fiscal year 2005–06. The state government provided $153&amp;nbsp;million, student fees accounted for $111&amp;nbsp;million, the federal government financed $84&amp;nbsp;million, and $45&amp;nbsp;million came from university sales and services. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $18&amp;nbsp;million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion in California.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt; Faculty members received nearly $87&amp;nbsp;million in research funding in 2005–06, mostly from federal agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Sponsored Programs Activity, Fiscal Year 2006 Annual Summary Report | publisher= University of California, Riverside, Office of Research | year= 2006 | url= http://or.ucr.edu/Files/pdf/annual2006.pdf | format= PDF | accessdate= 2007-08-22 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808175051/http://or.ucr.edu/Files/pdf/annual2006.pdf | archivedate= 2007-08-08 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total research [[expenditure]]s at Riverside are significantly concentrated in [[agricultural science]], accounting for 53% of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture"&gt;{{cite web | last = ICF Consulting | url = http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/itstartshere/report/fullreport.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030530034047/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/itstartshere/report/fullreport.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-05-30 | format = PDF | title = California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture | date = March 2003 | publisher = University of California, Office of the President | accessdate = 2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt;

Throughout UCR's history, researchers have developed more than 40&amp;nbsp;new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $960&amp;nbsp;million-a-year California [[agribusiness|citrus industry]] fight pests and diseases.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt; In 1927, [[entomologist]]s at the CES introduced two [[wasp]]s from [[Australia]] as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus [[mealybug]], saving growers in Orange County $1&amp;nbsp;million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing [[biological control]] as a practical means of reducing pest populations.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Saywer | first= Richard C. | title=To Make a Spotless Orange: Biological Control in California | location=[[West Lafayette, Indiana]] | publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] | year= 1996 | isbn=1-55753-285-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of [[gibberellic acid]] allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt; In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco [[grapefruit]], its first [[patent]]ed citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or [[tangerine]]), and others that have yet to be given [[trademark]] names.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt; To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the [[Riverside County, California|County of Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;

Admission to UC Riverside is rated as "selective" by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-riverside-1316|title=University of California-Riverside |year=2014|accessdate=2014-08-23|publisher=[[U.S. News and World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Fall 2015, UCR received 38,505 freshmen applications; 21,608 were admitted (56.1%).&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; The average [[GPA]] of the enrolled freshmen was 3.69, while the average [[SAT]] scores were 545 for critical reading, 574 for math, and 549 for writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sara.ucr.edu/main_menu.html?id=profile |title=Student Profiles, New Freshman Profile – 2015 |publisher=University of California, Riverside |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030124155/http://sara.ucr.edu/main_menu.html?id=profile |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, 43.4 percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7 percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24 percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by [[Academic Performance Index]] (API) scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=California Freshman Admit Profile Fall 2004, 2005, 2006 | url=http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2006/freshman_admit_profile_2006.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California | accessdate=2006-08-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040309/http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2006/freshman_admit_profile_2006.pdf | archivedate=2006-09-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, ''[[U.S. News]]'' ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving [[Pell Grants]] (42&amp;nbsp;percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.&lt;ref name="ethnic diversity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economic diversity"/&gt;

According to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3 percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Measuring Up 2006, The National Report Card on Higher Education | url=http://measuringup.highereducation.org/_docs/2006/NationalReport_2006.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | accessdate=2007-08-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185403/http://measuringup.highereducation.org/_docs/2006/NationalReport_2006.pdf | archivedate=2007-09-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=University of California, Riverside, Graduation Rates | url=http://www.collegeresults.org/search1a.aspx?InstitutionID=110671 | publisher=The Education Trust | accessdate= 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39 percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], making the campus a model for successful approaches to [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in higher education.&lt;ref name="Hebel"/&gt;

Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]'' to run stories stating that UCR is a "campus of choice" for minority students.&lt;ref name="LAT011507"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Traub"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE2DA163DF931A35756C0A96F958260 |title=The Class of Prop. 209|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate=2008-01-29|last=Traub|first=James|authorlink=James Traub|date=1998-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a [[gender-neutral housing]] option in 2005.&lt;ref name="LGBT ranking"/&gt; In recognition of this, ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' recognized UCR as one of the nation's best campuses for LGBT students in 2006, although it did not make the top 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Windmeyer | first=Shane L. | title=The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students | publisher=Alyson Publications, Inc. | year=2006 | isbn=1-55583-857-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Princeton Review]]'' listed UCR as a "Best Western College."&lt;ref name="unhappy students"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_S_hiednotes11.468022b.html |title=UCR not ranked high in survey's happiness category |last=Regus |first=Elaine |date=2008-08-10 |work=[[Press Enterprise (California)|Press Enterprise]] |publisher=[[A.

===Housing===
[[Image:Sunset, UCR.jpg|thumb|The [[Box Springs Mountains]] at dusk from the Pentland Hills [[residence hall]].]]
UCR's residence halls consist of three structures—Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills—which {{as of|2002|lc=y}} housed 2,930&amp;nbsp;students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus [[apartment complex]]es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959&amp;nbsp;students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt; Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007.&lt;ref name="HighlanderRidge"&gt;{{cite press release | title=UC Riverside Buys University House at Highlander Ridge | url=http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1575 | publisher=University of California, Riverside | date=2007-04-27 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus.&lt;ref name="HighlanderRidge"/&gt; Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.&lt;ref name="University of California, Riverside, campus life"&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, campus life | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include ''Unete a Mundo'', for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a [[gender-neutral]] community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UCR Housing Services | publisher = University of California, Riverside | url = http://housing.ucr.edu/CampusLiving/SpecialInterestCommunities.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212232055/http://housing.ucr.edu/CampusLiving/SpecialInterestCommunities.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations and activities===
UCR hosts over 375&amp;nbsp;registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Organizations| publisher= University of California, Riverside |url=http://resources.ucr.edu/studentlife/studentorgs/default.aspx | accessdate= 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16&amp;nbsp;elected senators, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment, 5 Executive Cabinet Officers (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, and Vice President of Finance), and 6 Directors, who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR, and a Judicial Council of 6, which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ASUCR Constitution| publisher=Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside| url=http://asucrexchange.ucr.edu/asucr_constitution_2015.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2016-03-22}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ASUCR v.

Of the registered student groups, 40 are [[fraternities and sororities]]. Nine men's fraternities belong to the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]]; seven women's sororities belong to the [[National Panhellenic Conference]]; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the [[National Multicultural Greek Council]], and two others fall under the campus [[La Raza|Raza]] Assembly and are unique to UCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life |publisher=University of California, Riverside |url=http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student+Organizations/Fraternity+and+Sorority+Life.htm |accessdate=2007-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112901/http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student%2BOrganizations/Fraternity%2Band%2BSorority%2BLife.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted.&lt;ref name="University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars"&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drextras_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Community Involvement | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html |accessdate= 2007-08-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070727042846/http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html| archivedate = July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iehillel.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Student media organizations include ''The Highlander'' student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, ''The Highlander'' remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however ''The Highlander'' is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Highlander Referendum, 2001 | publisher= Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside |url=http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html | accessdate= 2007-08-22| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060904172637/http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html| archivedate = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, ''The Highlander'' published a comic depicting a stereotypical [[Asian American]] graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Healy | first=Scott.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Winter Soulstice, Homecoming Bonfire and Spring Splash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ASPB | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url= http://www.aspb.ucr.edu | accessdate= 2007-08-22 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070703212643/http://aspb.ucr.edu/ | archive-date= 2007-07-03 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a "party school" stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=GASUCR, About the Council| publisher=Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside| url=http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html| accessdate=2007-08-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721194608/http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html| archivedate=2007-07-21| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR's [[varsity team]]s compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men's and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from [[NCAA Division II]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="Division I"/&gt; While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball. {{as of|2006}}, UCR had produced 17&amp;nbsp;individual national champions, 175&amp;nbsp;[[All-American]]s and many conference and regional champions. The men's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back-to-back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country.

The '''Vienna School of Art History''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte}}) was the development of fundamental [[art history|art-historical]] methods at the [[University of Vienna]]. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.

A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School  combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.

The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by [[Otto Benesch]] in 1920 and by [[Julius von Schlosser]] in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.

== History ==

===Pragmatic art history===

[[Rudolf Eitelberger]] is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the [[Vormärz]], and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.

The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was [[Moritz Thausing]], who in 1879 became the second ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from [[aesthetics]].

===Formalist art history===

Thausing's students [[Franz Wickhoff]] (Professor 1891) and [[Alois Riegl]] (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of [[late antiquity]], which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of [[positivism]], focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.

===Idealist art history===

After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by [[Max Dvořák]], who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of [[Mannerism]]. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed "''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte''" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in [[Hans Tietze]] and [[Otto Benesch]].

===Structuralist art history===

Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 [[Julius von Schlosser]] was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Karl Vossler]], a Munich-based professor of the [[Romance languages]], under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the "''Stilgeschichte''" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the "''Sprachgeschichte''" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides [[Ernst Gombrich]], were [[Hans Sedlmayr]] and [[Otto Pächt]], who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."

===Ideological art history===

[[Josef Strzygowski]], who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of "''Planforschung''," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.

===Synthesis===

The era of [[Nazism]] signified a turning point for the Vienna School.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Aurenhammer, "Zäsur oder Kontinuität? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im Ständestaat und im Nationalsozialismus." In ''Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven'' (''Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte'', 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. [[Hans Sedlmayr]], a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, [[Karl Maria Swoboda]] assumed leadership of the ''Insitut'', where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two ''Ordinarius'' positions were once more created, and were filled by [[Otto Pächt]] (a student of Schlosser) and [[Otto Demus]] (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a "''Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte''" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of [[Fritz Novotny]]. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

'''Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani''' (born 1951, in [[Rome]], Italy) is an [[architect]], [[Architectural theory|architectural theorist]] and [[History of architecture|architectural historian]] as well as a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|professor]] [[Emeritus|emeritus]] for the History of Urban Design at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)]]. He practices and promotes a formally disciplined, site- specific, and aesthetically sustainable form of architecture, one without modernist or postmodernist extravagances. As an author and editor of several acclaimed works of architectural history and theory, his ideas are widely cited.

== Academic education ==
Attended the Swiss primary school in Rome, then the German grammar school in Rome. From 1970 to 1973, he studied architecture at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University La Sapienza]] in Rome as well as at the [[University of Stuttgart]]. Lampugnani graduated in 1973 and completed his doctorate at the [[University of Stuttgart]] in 1977. In 1983, he acquired the [[Doctorate|Dottore in Architettura]] at the University of Rome.

== Teaching and research ==
Between the years of 1974 to 1980, Lampugnani was a research assistant for architecture and design at the [[University of Stuttgart]] at the chair of Jürgen Joedicke. From 1981-1982, he was awarded a [[German Academic Exchange Service|German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)]] scholarship under the Berlin program of artistic exchanges. Following from 1981 to 1983, Lampugnani also held a research fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies at [[Columbia University]] in New York. In 1983, he was appointed professor at the International Summer School of Fine Arts in Salzburg. From 1984 to 1985, he was a visiting professor at the Department of Architecture, at the Graduate School of Design at [[Harvard University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1985-1986, he was a fellow at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study]]. In 1990, Lampugnani was appointed professor to the [[Städelschule|State University of Fine Arts (Städelschule)]] in Frankfurt am Main. From 1994 to 2016, he was a full professor for the History of Urban Design at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)]]. From 1998 to 2001, Lampugnani was appointed dean of the [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|Department of Architecture at ETH Zurich]], after which he was the vice-dean of the faculty (2001-2003). From 2005 to 2007, he was appointed dean of the Network City and Landscape (NSL) at ETH Zurich. In the years between 2002 and 2007, Lampugnani founded and directed the postgraduate program «Urban Forms. Conditions and Consequences». From 2007 to 2010, he was the director of the working group «Spatial Sciences in the ETH Domain». Since 2008, he was deputy dean, two years later in 2010, he was appointed dean of the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta). During his tenure at ETH Zurich, Lampugnani has given numerous international lectures as well as held visiting professorships at institutions including: [[Harvard University]], Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura at the [[University of Navarra]] in Pamplona, and the Faculty of Architecture at the Politecnico in Milan.

A '''wildlife garden''' (or '''wild garden''')  is an environment created by a gardener that serves as a sustainable haven for surrounding wildlife. Wildlife gardens contain a variety of habitats that cater to native and local [[plants]], [[birds]], [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], [[insects]], [[mammals]] and so on. Establishing a garden that emulates the environment before the residence was built, and/or renders the garden similar to intact wild areas nearby, will allow natural systems to interact and establish an [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], ultimately minimizing the need for gardener maintenance and intervention. Wildlife gardens can also play an essential role in [[biological pest control]], and also promote [[biodiversity]], native plantings, and generally benefit the wider environment.

==Habitats==
Building a successful garden suitable for local wildlife is best accomplished through the use of multiple three-dimensional habitats with diverse structures that provide places for animals to nest and hide. Wildlife gardens may contain a range of habitats, including: 
 
'''Log piles''' – Preferably located in a shady area, a pile of logs is a sanctuary for insects and other invertebrates, as well as reptiles and amphibians. The organic structure is a shelter for both protection and breeding. In addition to logs, garden debris may also be added around the garden to be used as a natural [[mulch]], [[fertilizer]], [[weed control]], [[soil amendment]], and habitat for arthropod predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 131|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Bird feeding stations and bird houses''' – A place for birds to eat and take shelter will increase the number of birds in the garden, which play a key role in biological pest control. Not only will food and shelter increase the survival rate of birds, but it will also ensure that they are healthy enough for a successful breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbowt.org.uk/wildlife/gardening-wildlife|title= Gardening for Wildlife|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016|website= www.bbowt.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
'''Bug boxes and bee hotels''' – Bundles of hollow stems (elderberry, Joe-Pye weed, bamboo) can be hung up as an alternate place of shelter and breeding for beneficial insects, such as the [[Mason bee]], which are valuable pollinators.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xerces.org/2017/03/17/bring-back-the-pollinators-5-ways-to-increase-nesting-habitat-for-native-bees|title= Bring Back the Pollinators|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.xerces.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sources of water''' – A water feature, such as a pond, has the potential to support a large biodiversity of wildlife. To maximize the amount of wildlife attracted to the water feature, it should consist of ranging depths. Shallow areas are used by birds to drink and by insects and amphibians to lay eggs. Deeper areas provide habitat for aquatic insects and a place for amphibians, or even fish to swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbowt.org.uk/wildlife/wildlife-advice/wild-info-ponds/how-build-pond-wildlife|title= How to build a pond for wildlife|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.bbowt.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
'''Pollinators''' – Flowers rich in nectar will attract bees and butterflies into the garden, which is of particular importance given the dramatic reduction in pollinator populations in the US, Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xerces.org/bringbackthepollinators|title= Bring Back the Pollinators Campaign|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.xerces.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildflower meadows are an alternative option for lawns in the garden and will serve as a sanctuary for pollinators. However, pollinating plants should not be confused with plants suitable for butterfly breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 111|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Plant diversity''' – The garden should include a range of plant types to act as different habitats. A balance between ground cover, shrub, understory, and canopy species will allow different sized wildlife shelters that fit their individual needs. It is particularly important to use species that are native to the area or state, as native plants will reliably attract more insects and other invertebrates than foreign (non-native) plants; the increased number and variety of insects are valuable for their own sake and as an attraction for birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.audubon.org/plantsforbirds|title= Plants for Birds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.audubon.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of plants==
Although some exotics may also be included, as discussed in the previous section, wild gardens usually mostly feature a variety of native species. Generally, these will be a part of the pre-existing natural ecology of an area, making them easier to grow than most exotic species. Choosing [[native plants]] comes with an array of benefits for both plant and animal diversity, especially the ability to support native insect and fungal populations.
 
[[Ornamental plants]] on the market tend to lean toward “pest-free” plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 50|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it hard for native insects to adapt, and ultimately reducing their food supply. Decreases in insect populations due to excessive ornamental planting will discourage bird populations from inhabiting the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.audubon.org/plantsforbirds|title= Plants for Birds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2018|website= www.audubon.org|publisher= |access-date=1 January 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Invasive species]] can always prove problematic in the garden due to the absence of natural predators and their ability to reproduce rapidly. Without any measures of control, invasive species can easily overtake native species in the garden. Addressing invasive plants can be done a variety of ways; however, to ensure the least amount of damage to the surrounding ecosystem, this is best done by cutting down the plant, followed by painting its stem with an herbicide, such as [[Glyphosate|Roundup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallamy|first= Douglas|date= 2007|title= Bringing Nature Home|url= |location= Portland, Oregon|publisher= Timber Press|page= 140|isbn= 978-0-88192-992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris from the invasive species can be piled and used as a home for smaller critters. In Australia, it has been found that invasive species such as Lantana (''[[Lantana camara]]'') can also provide refuge for bird species such as the [[superb fairywren]] (''Malurus cyaneus'') and [[silvereye]] (''Zosterops lateralis''), in the absence of native plant equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archibald|first=Carla L.|last2=McKinney|first2=Matthew|last3=Mustin|first3=Karen|last4=Shanahan|first4=Danielle F.|last5=Possingham|first5=Hugh P.|date=2017-06-01|title=Assessing the impact of revegetation and weed control on urban sensitive bird species|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2960/abstract|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=7|issue=12|pages=4200–4208|doi=10.1002/ece3.2960|issn=2045-7758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful thought about how to balance invasive species management with what is best for urban biodiversity is needed for the best outcome in your garden.

== In the Netherlands ==
Wildlife gardens in the Netherlands are called "heemtuinen". The first was created in 1925: [[Thijsse's Hof]] (Garden of Thijsse) in [[Bloemendaal]], near [[Haarlem]]. It was gifted to [[Jac. P. Thijsse]] on the occasion of his 60th anniversary, and still exists today. The garden gives a display of about 800 plants native to the dune region of South [[Kennemerland]], in which the garden is situated. It is said to be one of the oldest wildlife gardens of its sort in the world.

Nowadays some 25 wildlife gardens exist in the Netherlands.
