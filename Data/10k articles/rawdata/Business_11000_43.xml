      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14651">'''Advanced nuclear''' is an emerging area of the energy industry focused on designing and commercializing next generation reactors for nuclear energy production. Encompassing more comprehensive and radical technological innovations and design advancements, these innovations aim to dramatically improve performance and eliminate known problems associated with the existing generation [[nuclear reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (Gen I and Gen II) currently in use around the world.

The earliest Gen I and Gen II nuclear reactors built utilized the [[light-water reactor]] design in one of three variants: the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), the [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), and the [[supercritical water reactor]] (SCWR). The use of the light-water design (i.e. using regular water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and not [[heavy water]], &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as both its coolant and [[neutron moderator]] but needing a plentiful supply) in all commercial reactors was a trade-off that enabled the industry to leverage the purchasing clout of Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who was keen on procuring nuclear-powered submarines for the Navy, to grow quickly. The choice, however, imposed a riskier design that many argued was not optimized for terrestrial energy, bringing both competitive advantages as well as fateful disadvantages to the initial development and subsequent growth of the commercial nuclear power fleet. Despite operating to the military's exacting specifications and winning praise and massive contracts from government buyers, the industry quickly earned the distrust of the public. (See the [[Anti-nuclear movement]].)

[[Generation III reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s contain yet further incremental refinements to aspects of [[Generation II reactor|Generation II]] [[nuclear reactor]] designs but were not very popular. Improvements were developed for [[Nuclear fuel|fuel technology]], [[thermal efficiency]], to safety systems to reduce maintenance and capital costs. The first Generation III reactor was [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki 6]] (an [[Advanced boiling water reactor|ABWR]]) in 1996 but the declining support for the underlying Generation II light-water design, caused relatively few third generation reactors to be built. 

[[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV]] designs are the first generation where innovator in Advanced Nuclear technologies are exploring paradigm shifts in methodologies. Gen IV projects encompass not just innovative nuclear fission concepts, like the [[Molten salt reactor]], [[Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[High temperature gas cooled reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, but also [[Fusion power]] and even Low Energy Nuclear Reactors (LENR), which generate heat through a series of controlled chemical reactions that then cause a nuclear bond to shift, which results in heat output. Gen IV is still in development as of 2017, and are not expected to start entering commercial operation until after 2020.
[[File:ORNL Alvin Weinberg MSRE 6Kh.jpg|thumb|ORNL director Alvin Weinberg notes the 6,000 hour of molten salt reactor experiment full-power operation in 1968.]]
Some of the different reactor design ideas being explored and developed for Advanced nuclear reactors, now thought of as [[Generation IV reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ('''Gen IV''') today were actually first conceived within the National Labs back in the 1960s. Several of these concepts, including [[Alvin M. Weinberg]]'s [[Molten salt reactor]] (MSR) developed at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), even had the benefit of being prototyped and tested over a period of time. Weinberg's MSR became the first reactor to run on Uranium 233 in 1968 and logged more than 13,000 hours at "full power" before being shut down in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ornl.gov/blog/ornl-review/time-warp-molten-salt-reactor-experiment-alvin-weinberg-s-magnum-opus|title=Time Warp: Molten Salt Reactor Experiment—Alvin Weinberg’s magnum opus {{!}} ORNL|website=www.ornl.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the concept of using a molten salt brew that acts both as the fuel and the "containment" of the reaction by using the ionic bonds of the salt to capture and contain the heat generated from the nuclear reaction, thereby dispensing with the need for expensive containment structures and eliminating much of risk and cost, remains of keen interest to those exploring Advanced nuclear technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orr, Jr.|first=Robert|date=September 2013|title=The Molten Salt Reactor: Nuclear Energy Without Fear?|url=|journal=Infinite Energy|volume=Issue 111|pages=35-36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The birth of a new industry ==
In November 2015, the Obama White House hosted a Summit on Nuclear Energy to examine the role of nuclear energy in reducing carbon emissions as part of its efforts to combat the threat of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nei.org/News-Media/Media-Room/News-Releases/White-House-Summit-Spotlights-Nuclear-Energy-s-Val|title=White House Summit Spotlights Nuclear Energy's Value in Climate Change Fight|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2015|website=www.nei.org|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 2016, the first "Advanced Nuclear Summit and Showcase" was held in Washington, D.C., hosted by [[Third Way (United States)|Third Way]], in partnership with the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL), [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (ANL), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/events/advanced-nuclear-summit|title=Advanced Nuclear Summit &amp; Showcase|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was also attended by a bi-partisan group of senators—[[Lisa Murkowski]] (R-AK), [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI), [[Mike Crapo]] (R-ID) and [[Cory Booker]] (D-NJ)—along with representatives from more than 150 organizations to show support for advancing nuclear innovation in the U.S. According to Third Way, Advanced Nuclear technologies are developing more rapidly than most experts expected and, as of 2015, there were 48 companies, start-ups or projects with funding of more than $1.3 billion in private capital working to "build the next generation of nuclear reactors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-advanced-nuclear-industry|title=The Advanced Nuclear Industry|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like the growth in technological innovation in other parts of the energy industry, which has seen the emergence of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting methane from shale formations where previously it was unavailable and improvements in solar panel efficiency and wind turbine efficiency, there's been a resurgence of interest in nuclear from younger engineers, physics Ph.Ds and investors seeking scale-level solutions to meeting global energy need with non-carbon-emitting energy. (See for example [[Transatomic Power]], whose website says "We at Transatomic Power are nuclear engineers with a new approach for electricity generation. We started this company because we believe it is possible to power the world while helping it thrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transatomicpower.com/|title=Homepage - Transatomic|website=Transatomic|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Despite the reported $1.3 billion in private funding, in fact experts worry that the lack of federal support for nuclear innovation in the U.S., means that most of the critical design and development work in Advanced Nuclear reactors is now being done in India, Russia, China, Canada, France, Japan, Korea and even Saudi Arabia, where in 2010 a royal decree said: "The development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom's growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/saudi-arabia.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Saudi Arabia - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia will be investing $80 billion in nuclear development over the next decade or two. India, Russia and China have all made enormous investments in support of their country's nuclear energy capabilities and, in 1983 Russia became the first country to put a Molten Salt Reactor, the [[BN-600 reactor]] online, which it did without much fanfare in the aftermath of its [[Chernobyl disaster]]. India, which "published about twice the number of papers on thorium as its nearest competitors, during each of the years from 2002 to 2006"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=srikumar|date=September 2010|title=Thorium Utilisation for Sustainable Supply of Nuclear Energy (pdf)|url=http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~kimballton/gem-star/workshop/presentations/banerjee.pdf|journal=Virginia Tech|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is expected to complete the world's first Advanced Thorium Molten Salt Reactor in late 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/india-has-almost-finished-the-worlds-first-advanced-thorium-nuclear-reactor/|title=India Has Almost Finished The World’s First Advanced Thorium Nuclear Reactor|website=The Daily Caller|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; even while it is already in the process of building the next six reactors taking the advances even further, and hopes to provide as much as 25% of its future electricity needs with clean advanced nuclear energy, utilizing its abundant thorium reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theenergycollective.com/dan-yurman/2398307/india-goes-large-plans-build-next-round-reactors|title=India Goes Large in Plans to Build Next Round of Reactors - The Energy Collective|date=2017-02-13|work=The Energy Collective|accessdate=2017-07-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be outdone, China plans to spend $570 billion building more than 60 nuclear power plants over the next decade, with a portion of this to develop its Advanced Nuclear capabilities,[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467] positioning itself to be the "Amazon.com" of nuclear commerce, according to Kenneth Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467|title=Study: U.S. "Losing Ground" To Russia And China On Nuclear Power|last=Follett|first=Andrew|website=The National Interest|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Global Nexus Initiative (GNI) found that, with the U.S. practically ignoring the needs of those working on Advanced Nuclear, the U.S. will lose significant competitive advantage within the energy industry as well as forego geopolitical influence by allowing its nuclear power industry to stagnate and fall behind, even while fossil fuels become increasingly supplanted by clean alternatives. Richard Meserve, former Chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and a member of the GNI study working group, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“This report draws attention to nuclear power’s geopolitical dimension, which often is overlooked in the debate. The nuclear rules are shaped by the countries with the largest market share, and traditional leaders like the US will soon be overtaken by China and Russia. There is a danger that the U.S. will lose the capacity to influence the global norms for safety, security and non-proliferation. There thus are national security issues at stake.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalnexusinitiative.org/uncategorized/nuclear-energys-role-in-fighting-climate-change-under-threat/|title=Nuclear Energy’s Role in Fighting Climate Change Under Threat – GNI|website=globalnexusinitiative.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fighting an uphill battle to change a bad reputation ==
Despite having funded the birth of nuclear age, the U.S. has not chosen to fund the refining work needed to optimize nuclear reactors for terrestrial energy. Into this void, the Generation IV International Forum, founded in 2001, has stepped, as "a co-operative international endeavor . . . to carry out the research and development needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of the next generation nuclear energy systems." There are currently ten active members: [[Canada]], [[China]], the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom), [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]. The non-active members are [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Whether this framework will enable the job to get done is yet to be seen.

The global race is on to design and commercialize cheaper, safer, and more efficient nuclear reactors to provide clean energy to the world. Even though many of the original ideas, technologies and research came out of the U.S.'s early investments in nuclear research and the work of thousands of American nuclear physicists and engineers laboring in the National Laboratories and nuclear industry in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, whatever patents and [[Intellectual property]] protections there were have long been expired. Now anyone anywhere can look at the achievements of people like [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] and start to develop the perfect thorium molten salt reactor. Already it is evident that Russia, India and China have been investing heavily in such efforts. American entrepreneurs, while appearing to be up for the challenge, are handicapped by having no clear government support, no federal funding, no regulatory pathway and very little in the way public support for their search for technological solutions that could unleash a vast new [[clean energy]] industry, producing jobs and retaining geopolitical influence on nuclear performance and safety standards, while simultaneously contributing to our solution for climate change. Even with growing bipartisan support for maintaining a robust and innovative nuclear industry in the face of all of these challenges, the lingering opposition of the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] makes the work of America's Advanced Nuclear entrepreneurs an uphill battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.energyxxi.org/nuclear|title=Nuclear|date=2014-08-15|work=Global Energy Institute|accessdate=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''advisory board''' is a body that provides non-binding strategic advice to the [[management]] of a [[corporation]], organization, or foundation. The informal nature of an advisory board gives greater flexibility in structure and management compared to the board of directors. Unlike the [[board of directors]], the advisory board does not have authority to vote on corporate matters or bear legal [[fiduciary]] responsibilities. Many new or small businesses choose to have advisory boards in order to benefit from the knowledge of others, without the expense or formality of the board of directors.

==Function==
The function of an advisory board is to offer assistance to enterprises with anything from marketing to managing human resources to influencing the direction of regulators. Advisory boards are composed of accomplished experts offering innovative advice and dynamic perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Stautberg S, Green N. Innovation from the Outside-In: How A Design Advisory Board Drives Innovation at P&amp;G [Internet]. 1st ed. 2014 [cited 22 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.partner-com.com/files/Design_Advisory_Board_022607.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting quarterly or biannually, boards can provide strategic direction, guide quality improvement, and assess program effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Marino, D. Rasor-Greenhalgh, S &amp; Hudak, S. (2010). Navigating practice and academic change in  collaborative partnership with a community advisory board. Journal of Allied Health, 39(3), 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs, especially from startup companies or small business may not want to dilute their control of their business by establishing a board of directors with formal responsibilities and authorities. Thus, an advisory board may be a more suitable solution to entrepreneurs who want access to high-quality advice and network in the industry. Advisory board, as an external group, could also provide non-biased information and advice to entrepreneurs.

Advisory boards can be implemented in various different areas, including science, medicine, technology, [[Editorial board|editorial policy]], citizen participation, and other topics.

===Roles and responsibilities of advisory board members===
*developing an understanding of the business, market and industry trends
*provide “wise counsel” on issues raised by owners/directors or management
*provide unbiased insights and ideas from a third point-of-view (not involved in the operation of the business)
*encourage and support the exploration of new business ideas
*act as a resource for executives
*provide social networking platform for directors and the company
*encourage the development of a governance framework that  enable sustainable growth of the company
*monitor business performance
*impose challenges to directors and management that could improve the business

Available from: http://www.companydirectors.com.au/~/media/Resources/Director%20Resource%20Centre/Directorship%20in%20your%20organistation/00660_SME_FY_The_Benefits_of_an_Advisory%20Board_web.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for creating an advisory board==
The main reason to create an advisory board is to seek expertise outside of the company. Advisory board members should provide the company with knowledge, understanding and strategic thinking of the industry or management of the company.

Companies should seek advisory board members whose qualities complement the existing board of directors and not mask gaps in knowledge or skill in the main board. An advisory board strengthens the existing board, but does not interfere with authorities of the existing board. The former editor of The Economist, also an advisory board member, once said, “They (advisory boards) are there to give focus to or sometimes challenge research and intelligence work being done in the company, thus avoiding [[groupthink]] and giving direction on big picture issues.”.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomley V, Bingham K, Thorning-Lund S, Slattery R. The Role of Advisory Boards - Who, what, why and how? [Internet]. 1st ed. Odgers Berndtson; 2014 [cited 25 October 2014]. Available from: http://www.odgersberndtson.co.uk/fileadmin/uploads/united-kingdom/Documents/K_I/The_Role_of_Advisory_Boards_-_Who__What__Why_and_How..pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating and operating an advisory board==
There are two key questions to be asked when creating and operating an advisory board. The first question is who is trying to achieve what from an advisory board. The second question is how the business of the board should be conducted. The following issues need to be addressed.

===Mandate===
The type of advisory board members should be determined by the nature of what is sought and expected from them by the enterprise. Advisory board members should have distinctive knowledge on different aspects of business such as marketing, product development, sales techniques that are of use to the directors.

A lack of definition in “what is sought from the advisory board” or “what sort of advice is to be sought of” would lead to a disorganized board, which eventually could lead to an advisory board that provide less value per dollar or hour invested than a well-mandated one. Eventually, it could result in a waste of resources and time for the enterprise and the advisory board members.

===Focus===
The advisory board must determine what the focus of the committee is, whether it is a broad focus or a narrow one on a specific product feature. Individuals in an advisory board should share a common goal or similar interests.

===Size===
Size of an advisory board influences the efficiency of delivering ongoing information and effectiveness of organizing board meetings. A large advisory board may result in managerial issues. Therefore, it is recommended that an advisory board begin with the advisory board leader, and grow from a fairly small size to its ultimate number. [[Group dynamics]] suggests the maximum size for an advisory board is eight members, which takes into account of the need for enterprise people and other facilitators at meetings. Some advisory board’s mandate may require more significant representation of a specific and large number of constituencies.

===Meeting organization and frequency===
The functioning of an advisory board is affected significantly by how effectively the group’s activities are organized and directed. A fixed meeting should be held regularly (monthly, annually or other) and advisory board members must be well informed of the purpose and background information of the meeting in order for them to provide valuable advice.

A corollary should be provided to advisory board members, in which it should be of an appropriate length, organized, comprehensible and informative. While it should be concise, it should provide enough details to provide advisory board members a suitable foundation for them to advise on the business. Confidentiality of the information discussed in the meeting shall be considered.

A skilled facilitator, administrator or corporate secretary is required to organize schedules of advisory board meetings and meeting materials. The facilitator or chair of the board should be committed and aware of time management for the meeting. An agenda could improve the organization and time management for the meeting.

===Term of membership===
Advisory board members could be appointed to specific terms i.e. one, two or three years so that it ensures them to actively commit to the company and prevent them to get too comfortable with their positions. Term of membership is also important when it comes to expansion of the board; term of membership ensures that the size of the advisory board remains efficient and manageable.

===Compensation===
Advisory board members serve an enterprise for a range of reasons, from personal loyalty to direct compensation.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits of an advisory board===
The benefits of having an advisory board over board of directors may include the following:
*'''Distance control'''
[[Multinational corporation|Multinational companies]] have local companies running their business in a particular foreign jurisdiction for lower costs e.g. tax, price of raw materials, and organizational benefits. However, giving authority to an outside group of directors in the local company may increase risks and instability of the multinational corporation. Since an advisory board can operate in a different location, with different cultural and business norms, in a different language, multinational companies may choose to have an advisory board instead of a localized board of directors in order to avoid loss of control.

*'''Preparation for board of directors'''
Companies may choose to have an advisory board before they have a board of directors. The development of an effective board of directors requires a group of individuals with good chemistry and has the combination of appropriate skills to propel the business. Having an advisory board allows companies to assess the commitments and capabilities of each individual and observe the chemistry between them before appointing them to a board of directors.

*'''Higher efficiency'''
A large board of directors may grow to an unmanageable size where organizational complexity and communication breakdown may occur, leading to ineffective and inefficient function of the board. A smaller advisory board, without the complexity of authority involved in board of directors, may work more effectively compared to a board of directors that grows in size as the corporation grows.

*'''Formal advice'''
The complexity and speed of enterprises often make it difficult to seek advice on any particular topic. Enterprises may also find building trust in any person or group to provide on-going and meaningful guidance difficult. An advisory board can then provide the degree of consistency, longevity and background knowledge as advisory board members provide reliable advice on particular issues. Advisory board members receive compensation for committing to their positions. This gives incentives to advisory board members to provide quality advice and ensure that a request for assistance is taken formally.

*'''Less pressure on executives'''
Executives can express partially defined or tentative view to an advisory board since advisory board’s sole purpose is to provide advice. This allows them to “test-drive options” before they face the board of directors which demands definitive and assertive business decisions. The board of directors assesses the CEO and establishes his or her compensation. While an advisory board may induce change in the company for the benefits of the company, a board of directors inducing change in the company could suggest a lack of confidence in the senior management team. This imposes great pressure on senior executives and could become a barrier for senior executives to express their issues and seek advice from the board. Thus, an advisory board could be a ‘safe harbor’ for senior executives to seek advice and test business options.

*'''Directoral Input'''
Directors and Assistant Directors are still required to bring any changes to policy or financial matters to the board for direction. No directors or assistant directors are to make any changes without board approval.

*'''Focused input'''
An enterprise may need advice on a particular aspect of its business (such as marketing, product direction, customer service or contact network expansion). While board of directors need to take into account of all aspects and go through a series of administrative proceedings e.g. formal approvals, ratification, an advisory board can focus directly on a particular issue and give advice.

===Drawbacks of an advisory board===
The drawbacks of having an advisory board instead of a board of directors may include the following:
*'''Less compensation'''
An advisory board deals with a more narrow range of issues and meet less often than board of directors. There is less commitment for advisory board members compared to directors in the board. This is reflected in the lower compensation advisory board members receive as compared to those in the board of directors. Nevertheless, the compensation for advisory board members depends on various factors, including return of investments, time, organization and cost.

*'''Fiduciary duty/ liability issues'''
Board of directors is exposed to a variety of legislated liabilities, fiduciary and other duties. Responsibilities include unpaid wages, unpaid taxes, environmental damage, etc. By subjecting directors to such liabilities and fiduciary, directors are forced to make decisions and establish policies in a way that minimizes risks. Whereas, an advisory board is not subjected to fiduciary duties or liabilities and therefore could influence the enterprise by providing risky advice.

The '''Alberta Enterprise Group''' (AEG) is a member-based, non-profit business advocacy organization based in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/ccc/srch/nvgt.do?lang=eng&amp;prtl=1&amp;sbPrtl=&amp;estblmntNo=234567134622&amp;profile=cmpltPrfl&amp;profileId=1921&amp;app=sold|title=Alberta Enterprise Group|publisher=Industry Canada|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization claims its members collectively employ more than 150,000 people and generate billions in economic activity each year.&lt;ref name=AEG&gt;[http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/about-us ''Alberta Enterprise Group'', About us, Accessed: Feb. 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231054038/http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/about-us |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization states its mission as applying the collective experience of its members in order to solve public policy challenges and to form and promote public policy solutions and to provide forums for the exchange of ideas and best practices.&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

==History==
In 2006 a group of Alberta business leaders came together to form a [[fundraising]]/[[political]] action group called Grassroots Leadership Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= 
Norris takes business approach to leadership|url=http://www.edsonleader.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&amp;e=1908414|publisher=''Edson Leader'' |year=2006|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group unsuccessfully supported [[Mark Norris (Canadian politician)|Mark Norris]] on the first [[ballot]] in his [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]] leadership bid. After Norris dropped off the ballot, the group supported eventual winner [[Ed Stelmach]] on the second ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calgary|last=Herald|title= 
Consulting company set up to finance Norris's bid|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=0a181d46-2d32-466c-ac84-b3da7f7c792c|publisher=''Edmonton Journal'' |date=March 31, 2006|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the PC leadership process, Grassroots Leadership Group members decided to keep the group together as a business advocacy organization and re-branded as Alberta Enterprise Group, headed by then-Chairman [[Cal Nichols]].

Until 2013 the organization was led by Tim Shipton until his departure in November of that year.&lt;ref name="Tim Shipton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Shipton joins Rexall Sports Corp.|url=http://oilers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=688214|website=oilers.nhl.com|publisher=Edmonton Oilers|accessdate=5 June 2014|ref=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tim Shipton was previously director of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

In February, 2014 the organization announced the appointment of Josh Bilyk as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New leadership at business advocacy group|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/new-leadership-at-business-advocacy-group-3/|website=www.albertaenterprisegroup.com|publisher=Alberta Enterprise Group|accessdate=5 June 2014|ref=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The organization has conducted several meetings over the years trying to draw more business to Canada.  In 2008 AEG brought 100 of the province's business leaders to [[Washington D.C.]] to meet with congressional leaders and [[United States]] business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.alberta.ca/documents/International/Premier_Mission_to_Washington_DC.pdf|title=International Premier Mission to Washington|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2009 the organization brought more than 60 of the province's business leaders to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in an effort to showcase Alberta to the [[Europe]]an investment community. In both 2008 and 2009 the organization brought more than 150 businessmen and politicians from across [[North America]] to tour the [[Alberta oil sands|oil sands mining operations]]. Participants  visited [[Syncrude]], [[Albian]] and CNRL's Horizon Mine.&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

In the spring of 2010, AEG organized the Alberta Connects outreach mission to [[Ottawa]].  Alberta Connects introduced AEG members to [[Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], Finance Minister Flaherty, Environment Minister Prentice, Liberal Leader [[Michael Ignatieff]] and 55 other Members of Parliament and Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimcapitalcorp.com/pages/EventReview-AlbertaConnect2010.pdf|title=Alberta Connects 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the group returned to Washington, D.C. to engage U.S political leaders in a discussion on improving trade relations between Canada and the United States and ensuring market access for Canadian energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/05/26/david-maclean-in-washington-a-guest-blog/|title=''Edmonton Journal'', David MacLean in Washington: a guest blog|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the group brought a delegation of 40 business leaders to Quebec to meet with business and political leaders in that province, purportedly to improve trade ties between the two provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/news/canada-connects-quebec-review|title=''ALG'', Canada Connect Quebec|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the group [https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-heres-a-new-one-alberta-firms-seek-opportunities-in-b-c organized a trade mission to British Columbia] where it met with British Columbia Energy and Mines Minister Bill Bennett, First Nations Energy &amp; Mining Council CEO Dave Porter, and Iain Black, CEO of the Vancouver Board of Trade and others. A mission highlight was a keynote address by MEG Energy CEO Bill McCaffrey.

The organization is a strong proponent of what it calls "sustainable resource development," arguing that impediments to resource development imposed by excessive regulation hurt the Canadian economy and government revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/business/2035/Barbara+Yaffe+Alberta+must+satisfy+each+other+pipeline+concerns/7917453/story.html|title=''Vancouver Sun'', Barbara Yaffe: B.C., Alberta must satisfy each other's pipeline concerns|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has also been engaged in the discussion on Alberta's provincial budget, advocating spending restraint as opposed to tax increases to address a growing government deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/talk+about+control+public+spending/7538139/story.html|title=''Calgary Herald'', MacLean: Let's talk about out-of-control public spending|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business taxation advocacy===
In April 2015, during the [[2015 Alberta general election campaign]] the group released a [http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AEG-Alberta-business-tax-competitiveness-April-28-2015-final.pdf study] [https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/maclean-its-a-bad-idea-to-raise-corporate-taxes arguing that increasing business taxes would kill jobs and investment, increase consumer prices and reduce wages for workers.]

===Labour Reform===
The organization has also published information regarding [[collective bargaining]]. In December 2009 AEG released a study calling for reforms to provincial [[labour laws]], hoping to create good business climates while upholding the collective bargaining rights of workers. The paper argued that the Canada's labour laws lag behind [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  Some of the recommendations in the study included: having membership cards instead of signing petitions; requiring a quorum, and allowing unionized workers in Alberta be allowed opt out of the portion of their union dues that is spent on lobbying and political activities.&lt;ref name=labour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/news/aeg-calls-for-labour-reform|title=Alberta Enterprise Group calls for Labour Reform|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization supported enacting a Worker Free Choice Act (WFCA) to which would allow workers the right to choose whether or not to join or financially support a union as a condition of employment. Bob Barnetson, who is an associate professor of labour relations at Athabasca University, spoke out against the study's conclusions and how it was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertalabour.blogspot.com/2011/01/labour-reform-courtesy-of-alberta.html|title=Labour reform courtesy of the Alberta Enterprise Group|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the study was endorsed by the Merit Contractors Association, Canadian Constitution Foundation and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.&lt;ref name=labour/&gt; A survey conducted by AEG also found that 65 percent believed 70 percent of employees should vote to certify or decertify a union.  The poll also found that 78 percent agreed that union dues should only be spent on collective bargaining and union management instead of policy influence.

===Edmonton City Centre Airport===
Also in 2009, the organization waged a campaign to save the [[Edmonton City Centre Airport]] from closure, arguing that the facility is an economic asset and an important component of the province's health system, saying it provided $400 million in economic output annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/Ascend_AEG_report_--_June_23rd_Final.pdf|title=Ascent AEG Report|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group ran a petition to keep the airport open, collecting over 1000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Edmonton City Centre Airport debate heats up online |url=http://www.inews880.com/Channels/Reg/LocalNews/story.aspx?ID=1108542|publisher=''iNews 880'' |date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions about compromising and only closing one lane, Edmonton City Councillors ultimately voted to close the [[Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport|airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Kevin Libin: A plot to kill Edmonton's city airport?|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/23/kevin-libin-a-secret-plot-to-kill-edmontons-city-airport/|publisher=''National Post'' |date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil sands===
Im May 2011 AEG went to Washington, D.C. to talk about borders security, [[energy]] development and trade. Participants met with Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to discuss the pending decision on the [[Keystone XL pipeline]].&lt;ref name=keystone&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=David MacLean in Washington: a guest blog|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/05/26/david-maclean-in-washington-a-guest-blog/|publisher=''Edmonton Journal'' |date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meetings noted that [[tar sands]] knowledge had increased, discussed Canada's commitment to its environment and the benefits of the oil sands to America.  In December 2011, AEG led a counter-boycott of [[Chiquita Bananas]] in response to the company signing on to an anti-oil sands campaign coordinated by [[California]]-based environmental advocacy group Forest Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Oil sands lobby fires back at Chiquita|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=ee91cbbd-2ec0-45e8-a73b-572b2e340f1e|publisher=''National Post'' |date=December 17, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiquita later said that it would continue to use Canadian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Chiquita won't join bunch boycotting Alberta oilsands products|url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/Chiquita+join+bunch+boycotting+oilsands+products/5900976/story.html|publisher=''Montreal Gazette'' |date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi-Strauss and Timberland were also targeted by AEG in the boycott of the boycotters, but were later taken down from the page after the companies said they would not boycott Canadian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Canadians Urged to boycott GAP, Levi-Strauss and Timberland|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/681005/canadians-urged-to-boycott-gap-levi-strauss-and-timberland|publisher=''News Wire'' |date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Alberta business group applauds Gap, Levi clarification|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/579865/alberta-business-group-applauds-gap-levi-clarification|publisher=''News Wire'' |date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The '''Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA)''', formerly known as the '''International Crop Improvement Association,''' is a [[trade organization]] based in the United States. Founded in 1919, its function is to develop and promote [[Certification|certified]] varieties of [[seed]] for agricultural use.

==History==
The International Crop Improvement Association evolved from the [[Wisconsin Crop Improvement Association]] (WCIA), initially called the [[Wisconsin Experiment Association]]. This was organized in 1901 by [[Ransom Asa Moore]] at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]] College of Agriculture, aided by graduates of that college and farmers, with the objective of improving and disseminating strains of seed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;University of Wisconsin Agronomy Department, the First 100 Years: A Brief History of Agronomy at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison from 1903 to 2002, University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison. Dept. of Agronomy, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, 2003, {{ISBN|0967958741}}, 9780967958743&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the International Crop Improvement Association followed in December 1919 when Moore presented a proposed constitution for the organization in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was proposed that the organization be international rather than national to allow Canada to be a member.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moore was named the first president of the organization in 1920.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Functions==
The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) assists clients in the production, identification, distribution and promotion of certified classes of seed and other crop propagation materials. Its membership currently includes seed certifying agencies across the US, and member countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Brazil. Its mission is "To promote and facilitate the movement of seed or plant products in local, national, and international markets through the coordinated efforts of official seed certification agencies acting to evaluate, document, and verify that a seed or plant product meets certain accepted standards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aosca.org/Page/About_AOSCA.aspx?nt=85 About AOSCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">'''Association of Telehealth Service Providers''' (ATSP) is an international membership-based [[trade]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to improving health care through growth of the [[telehealth]] industry and promoting the use of [[telecommunications]] in healthcare. Its main activities are advocacy, education awareness programs, and business support services. It is a business-oriented group which focuses on providing members with information and tools to facilitate the success of their telehealth activities.

ATSP believes that [[telemedicine]] is a practical tool that can improve the distribution of healthcare services to the benefit of both patients and providers.

It was founded in 1996 by [[Douglas Perednia]], MD and is located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  Its executive director is [[Will Engle]].

==Telemedicine Information Exchange ==

In June 2006, the ATSP announced that it was taking over the hosting and updating responsibilities for the [[Telemedicine Information Exchange]] (TIE). The TIE's mission is to provide an online, unbiased, all-inclusive platform for information on telemedicine and telehealth. As of April 2012, this site seems to be down.

'''Ayo Ogunsheye''' is a [[Nigerian]] academic, [[nationalism]] scholar and former head of the extra murals department of [[University of Ibadan]]. In 1970, he was one of the major high-profile executive personnel brought into indigenous private enterprise which were historically family dominated at the executive level.&lt;ref&gt;Tom G. Forrest, The Advance of African Capital: The Growth of Nigerian Private Enterprise . p 95. University of Virginia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Henry Fajemirokun]] in 1979, he became the Chief Executive officer of Henry Stephens Nigeria Limited.

==Extra murals department==
The extra [[murals]] [[Academic department|department]] of the [[university]] of Ibadan was established in 1949 to focus on [[adult education]] in the nation. A reason given for its creation was to expand [[knowledge]] to non-Ibadan graduates so as not to create a dominant network of [[college graduate|graduate]] [[elites]]. However, the prospect of [[independence]] led to increased enthusiasm for knowledge in various towns and cities. The department soon devoted resources and research into the issue of self-government. A number of nationalistic politicians attended courses or seminars offered by the department in the 1950s. Ayo Ogunsheye, as director was a vital element in the department which included noted scholar [[Ulli Beier]].

===Self government seminar===
As an academic, Ayo Ogunsheye wrote often on the need to tilt education towards improving [[nation]]al [[consciousness]] and bringing the informal education sector into public consciousness. In 1959, when the clamor for independence was at it loudest, a conference was held at [[Ibadan]] to hash out impending independent issues. As chairman of the first of such [[seminar]] in the region, the international conference discussed 'representative government and Progress in West Africa'.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;K. A. B. Jones-Quartey, H. Passin; Africa: The Dynamic of Change. University Press, 1963. p 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his views about self-government emphasized the need to ensure internal [[Social cohesion|cohesion]] in order to improve the [[standard of living]] of citizens. Using the [[adage]], a nation divided against itself cannot stand, he stressed the extradition of internal chaos by the use of an appropriate  [[constitution]], which would become a necessary factor for strengthening the country,&lt;ref&gt;Jones p 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; However, like his views on education, a lot them dealt with nationalism and how to ensure dynamic progress for black Africa. He also emphasized major complementary cases for unity in [[West Africa]] and Nigeria. That Nigeria as a large and diverse nation will provide instances where regions can benefit from fair exchange of food and resources. The need to attract foreign [[Financial capital|capital]] will become closer to reality with the existence of a large [[country]] suitable for foreign investors.  Most of his views shed light on the need to maximize the potential of a large [[nation]] in order to benefit from increased external visibility and internal [[financial]] base for extended social services.&lt;ref&gt;Jones  p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Business/IT Fusion: How to Move Beyond Alignment and Transform IT in Your Organization''''' is a business book by [[Peter Hinssen]], published in 2009. It discusses an approach to [[IT management]] different to the classic model of [[business/IT alignment]]. In place of alignment focused on the collaboration between business and IT, Hinssen suggests that the future evolution in IT lies in the convergence of the two parties: integrating IT into the business rather than treating it as a supplier. The work is presented as a guidebook to "IT 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Can-the-IT-department-survive-Web-20|title=Can the IT department survive Web 2.0?|accessdate=November 24, 2013|work=[[Computer Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digimedia.be/News/nl/5060/column-sant-in-eigen-land.html|title=Column: sant in eigen land|date=December 22, 2008|accessdate=November 24, 2013|work=Digimedia|first=Ben|last=Caudron|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/team-building-and-staffing/global-cio-business-it-alignment-is-dead----whats-next/d/d-id/1076281?|title=Global CIO: Business/IT Alignment 'Is Dead' -- What's Next?|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=November 24, 2013|work=[[InformationWeek]]|first=Bob|last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6minutes.be/Artikel.aspx?ArtikelID=14735&amp;RubriekID=19|title=Peter Hinssen: fusion business–IT en livre|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=November 24, 2013|work=6minutes|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OpenTTD-1.1.0-en.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''[[OpenTTD]]'' (2014) is a business simulation game]]


There are many games in this genre which have been designed around numerous different enterprises and different simulations. ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'' can be called a business simulation because the goal of the game is to attract customers and make profits, but the game also involves a building aspect that makes it a [[construction and management simulation]].&lt;ref name="Rollings"/&gt; This genre also includes many of the "tycoon" games such as ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''. Another similar example of a business simulation (that models a startup business) is "SimVenture Classic".

[[Trevor Chan]] is a notable developer of business simulation games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/425/425910p1.html IGN: Joan of Arc Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; having developed the 1995 game ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]'' which has been described as the "best business simulation game".&lt;ref name="capitalism2review"/&gt; Similar in complexity and functionality is [[Virtonomics]] business simulation. This is a browser-based multiplayer game in which realistic market behavior is formed as a result of the interaction of a large number of players.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inc.com/margarita-hakobyan/2-types-of-brain-games-that-can-substantially-improve-your-decision-making.html INC: 2 Types of Brain Games That Can Substantially Improve Your Decision-Making&lt;/ref&gt;

Active development of Internet technologies and the growth of the Internet audience in recent years gave a powerful impetus to the development of the industry of online games, and in particular, online business simulations.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt; There are many varieties of online business simulations - browser-based and downloadable, single-player and multiplayer, real-time and turn-based. Some online simulations are aimed primarily at the leisure market while others have real world applications in training, education and modelling.

'''Cognos ReportNet (CRN)''' is a web-based [[software]] product for creating and managing [[ad hoc]] and custom-made reports. ReportNet is developed by the [[Ottawa]]-based  company [[Cognos]] (formerly Cognos Incorporated), an [[IBM]] company. The web-based reporting tool was launched in September 2003. Since IBM's acquisition of Cognos, ReportNet has been renamed ''IBM Cognos ReportNet'' like all other Cognos products.

ReportNet uses web services standards such as [[XML]] and [[Simple Object Access Protocol]] and also supports dynamic [[HTML]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312025955/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2123232/bear-sterns-chooses-cognos-reportnet Cognos ReportNet in news]&lt;/ref&gt; ReportNet is compatible with multiple databases including [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Teradata]], [[Microsoft SQL server]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]] and [[Sybase]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/solutions/data/ibm/advantages.html Data sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195555/http://www.cognos.com/solutions/data/ibm/advantages.html |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.cognos.com/en/support/products/crn101_software_environments.html CRN Environment details]&lt;/ref&gt; The product provides interface in over 10 languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/products/business_intelligence/reporting/features.html CRN Features] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330050308/http://www.cognos.com/products/business_intelligence/reporting/features.html |date=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has Web Services architecture to meet the needs of multi-national, diversified enterprises and helps reduce total cost of ownership. Multiple versions of Cognos ReportNet have since been released by the company. Cognos ReportNet was awarded the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) 2005 [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]]s for the "Best Business Intelligence or Knowledge Management Solution" category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywire.com/pubs/PRNewswire/2005/06/08/885642?extID=10051 Cognos ReportNet wins award]&lt;/ref&gt; CRN's capabilities have been further used in [[IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence|IBM Cognos 8 BI (2005)]], the latest reporting tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/products/cognos8businessintelligence Cognos 8 BI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415200240/http://www.cognos.com/products/cognos8businessintelligence/ |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRN comes with its own [[software development kit]] (SDK).

==Launch==
Early adopters of Cognos ReportNet for their corporate reporting needs included [[Bear Stearns]], [[BMW]] and [[Alfred Publishing]]. Around this same time of launch, Cognos competitor [[Business Objects]] released version 6.1 of its enterprise reporting tool. Cognos ReportNet has been successful since its launch, raising revenues in 2004 from licensing fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131525446.html Cognos ReportNet delivers $30 Million in License Revenue in one Quarter]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other major corporations like [[McDonald's]] adopted Cognos ReportNet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebizq.net/news/5538.html ReportNet and fries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Cognos rival [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] announced in 2005 that BusinessObjects XI significantly outperformed Cognos ReportNet in benchmark tests conducted by VeriTest, an independent software testing firm. The tests performed showed Cognos ReportNet performed poorly when processing styled reports, complex business reports and combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm2day.com/news/crm/114773.php BO XI Vs Cognos ReportNet]&lt;/ref&gt; The tests reported a massive 21 times higher report throughput for BusinessObjects XI than Cognos ReportNet at capacity loads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-4404821_ITM BO XI outperforms Cognos ReportNet]&lt;/ref&gt; Cognos soon dismissed the claims by stating Business Objects dictated the environment and testing criteria and Cognos did not provide the software to participate in benchmark test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2005/0624_3.html Cognos dismisses the Test results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405194220/http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2005/0624_3.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognos later performed their own test to demonstrate Cognos ReportNet capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/pdfs/whitepapers/wp_cognos_reportnet_scalability_benchmakrs_ms_windows.pdf Cognos scalability results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707044816/http://www.cognos.com/pdfs/whitepapers/wp_cognos_reportnet_scalability_benchmakrs_ms_windows.pdf |date=2008-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colm O'Rourke''' (born 31 August 1957) is a retired [[Gaelic football]]er and current [[Sports broadcasting|sports broadcaster]]. His [[National Football League (Ireland)|league]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] career with the [[Meath GAA|Meath]] senior team spanned twenty years from 1975 to 1995.

Born in Aughavas, [[County Leitrim]], O'Rourke was raised in [[Skryne]], [[County Meath]] after his family moved there in his youth. He played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at [[St Patrick's Classical School|St. Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]]. O'Rourke first appeared for the [[Skryne GFC|Skryne]] club at underage levels, before winning two [[Meath Senior Football Championship|county senior championship]] medals in 1992 and 1993. While studying at [[University College Dublin]] he won a [[Sigerson Cup]] medal in 1979.

O'Rourke made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked for the Meath minor team. He later joined the under-21 side but enjoyed little success in these grades. O'Rourke made his senior debut during the [[1975-76 National Football League (Ireland)|1975-76 league]]. Over the course of the next twenty years he was a regular member of the starting fifteen and won back-to-back [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] medals, three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] medals and was named [[Texaco Footballer of the Year|Footballer of the Year]] in 1991. O'Rourke played his last game for Meath in July 1995.

In retirement from playing O'Rourke combined his teaching career with a new position as a sports broadcaster. His media career began with [[RTÉ]] where he has worked as a studio analyst with the flagship programme ''[[the Sunday Game]]'' for over twenty-five years. O'Rourke also writes a weekly column for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.

==Personal life==
Despite becoming an inter-county Meath footballer, O'Rourke is not a Meathman by birth; he was born in the small parish of Aughavas within [[County Leitrim]].&lt;ref name="HoganStand"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hoganstand.com/Meath/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=48494 | title = Colm O'Rourke Happy 51st | work=The Hogan Stand | publisher = Lynn Publications | date = 13 September 1991 | accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his family as a youngster from Leitrim to [[County Meath]]

O'Rourke is a descendant of the Uí Ruairc royal house of [[Breffni]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He has, however, been accepted by the people of [[Skryne]] in Meath as one of their own forty years after arriving from Aughavas. He is the secondary school principal in [[St. Patrick's Classical School (Navan)|St. Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]] where he has trained the Gaelic football team to numerous successes at provincial and national level throughout the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of St. Patrick's Classical School, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also managed Colm O'Rourke Sports, his own sports shop in Navan Shopping Centre, during this period. He started working for RTÉ on [[The Sunday Game]] in 1991, and has been a contributor to sports columns in national newspapers. He is continuously being linked with managing the Meath senior football team, previously held by [[Seán Boylan]], another man with [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] connections.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} O'Rourke's son [[Shane O'Rourke|Shane]] also played with the Meath senior football team, while his nephew [[Patrick O'Rourke (Gaelic footballer)|Paddy]] has played as a goalkeeper for Meath.

==Playing career==
As a Gaelic footballer, O'Rourke won two [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals with Meath, in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]] medals and three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] titles.

O'Rourke received three All-Star for Meath in 1983, 1988 and 1991.

The '''Compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases''' is a workers compensation scheme administered by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. It was established in November 1982 by [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] and its [[Trade union|trade unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=shCh5KzE7xEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay7uRDDnnA&amp;sig=bHI_Fkk4rUc8nrJO_z454mgC10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=The Redfern Inquiry into human tissue analysis in UK nuclear facilities|last=|first=|date=2010-11-16|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=|isbn=9780102966183|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following legal actions brought against the company by nuclear industry workers in the late 1970s. At the time of its establishment, BNFL and its trade unions agreed that the causation of cancer by radiation was sufficiently well understood that "it should be possible to construct a scheme which would evaluate the probability that a diagnosed cancer may have been caused by radiation exposure at work." Initially the scheme only accepted claims in which a worker had died from a radiation-linked disease. In 1987 this was expanded to allow [[Disease|morbidity]] claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_history.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of participating member employers and trade unions has grown through the 1990s and 2000s. As of December 2015, 1525 claims have been made out of which 156 have been successful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/annual_statement.php|title=CSRLD: 2015 Compensation Scheme Annual Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-12-01|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible for compensation, a worker must have been employed by a listed company, and have received an occupational radiation dose. Then the claimant must have developed [[cancer]] of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Bone Cancer|bone]], [[Brain cancer|brain]] and central nervous system, [[Breast cancer|breast]] or [[Uterine cancer|uterus]] (for female workers), [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Liver cancer|liver]], [[Esophageal cancer|oesophagus]], respiratory or [[Lung cancer|lung]], prostate, [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], skin (non-Melanoma), [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] or other tissues. Other compensable diseases include [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[Leukemia|leukaemias]] (with two exceptions). Some diseases are excluded on the basis that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence to link them with ionising radiation exposure. Excluded diseases include: [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin’s disease]], [[Hairy cell leukemia|hairy cell leukaemia]], [[Chronic lymphatic leukemia|chronic lymphatic leukaemia]] (CLL), [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]] and [[mesothelioma]].

=== Member Trade Unions ===
In 1982, trade union members of the scheme included [[Transport and General Workers' Union|Transport and General Workers Union]], [[Institution of Professional Civil Servants]], [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and PCS. Other trades unions joined as the scheme expanded. Later members include the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|EETPU]] and [[Manufacturing Science Finance|MSF]], [[Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians|UCATT]], [[Engineers and Managers Association]], [[UNISON|Unison]], the [[First Division Association]] of Civil Servants, the AEA Constabulary Federation (now the Civil Nuclear Police Federation) and the [[Defence Police Federation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_employers.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme employers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming compensation ==
Claims may be lodged by the worker, his or her wife, husband or partner (including same sex), the worker's "first line children" (those born to or legally adopted by the claimant). Once diagnosed with or deceased from an eligible disease, the worker or surviving family members have 30 years in which to make a claim. Claims can be made online, by post, by phone or through the worker's trade union. Once made, claims are assessed on consideration of medical, employment and dosimetry histories and data. These are used to calculate the probability that the cancer could have been caused by occupational exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/qa.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Q &amp; A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payments ==
The payment received following a successful claim varies depending on the actual loss (in earnings and pension) suffered by the claimant and sums for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and number of dependents. The level of payment awarded to a claimant (or estate if deceased) is determined by the "causation probability". The greater the causation probability, the greater the payment. Top tier payments are awarded if the causation probability is 50% or more. The Scheme publishes an Annual statement which is approved by the Scheme Council. The report includes a paragraph updating the number of claims and payments awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/case_processing.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Case Processing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 February 2005, 1000 claims had been made, of which 97 had been awarded to varying degrees along a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oxqdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCtN2E6adQ&amp;sig=0MUeAJ5xKrJx-EFVDn_13BMYhEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2005-10-01|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309096102|location=|pages=137|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, 1525 cases had been considered since the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases was established. 156 of these claims were successful, and payments totaling £8.24 million had been dispatched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Dan Goldstein''' (b. 1954) is a pioneer of the Israeli software industry. He is the founder of  [[Formula Systems]], sold in 2006, and [[Formula Vision Technologies]]. Goldstein serves as Chairman of The Public Companies Association in Israel.

==Biography==
Dan Goldstein was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. He immigrated to [[Israel]] with his family in 1960. After completing his BA in computer science and mathematics and an MA in business administration, he studied for a PhD in mathematics.{{cn|date=September 2014}}
==Business and investment career==
In 1980, while writing his doctoral thesis on distributed networks, he founded Formula Software Services, providing professional software services to Israeli customers. By 1985 he expanded to other areas such as software products and consulting, and in 1985 he founded [[Formula Systems]] (1985) Ltd., as a holding corporation for his software products, services and consulting activities. In 1988 he acquired control of a publicly traded company named "Eichut Computers", which he turned into the communications arm of the developing '''Formula Group'''. He later acquired "Idan Inc.", a public company traded on Nasdaq,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated Ami Harel as its CEO. This company was a pioneer in the developing Israeli communications market in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the accelerated regulation of overseas voice and data communication. As the group grew, Goldstein formulated an investment strategy of specialization in software products and services for [[vertical market]]s. He acquired controlling interests in a number of young companies, such as ''Applicom'', a software house for [[Mini Computer]]s, ''Wiztech'', which specialized in Billing, and [[BluePhoenix|Crystal]], which specialized in large conversion projects. By 1990 Goldstein established the position of Formula Systems as a leading software group in Israel. He founded ''Foraz'', the first Israeli [[Venture Capital]] [[Funding|Fund]], together with ''Liraz'', a publicly traded company headed by Arik Kilman. Goldstein later acquired Liraz's share in the fund, and later acquired control of Liraz itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Goldstein acquired other technology companies. He bought a Telecom billing company headed by Amos Sivan and changed its name to ''Formula Telecom Solutions'' '''(FTS)''', Acquired an insurance software company headed by Zeev Alon and renamed it ''Formula Insurance Solutions'' '''(FIS)''', a retail software company called "Az-Ben", which he renamed ''Formula Retail Solutions'' '''(FRS)''', and a Travel solutions company headed by Menahem Shaked, which he named ''Formula Travel Solutions''. He also acquired ''Nikuv Computers'', one of the first publicly traded software services companies in Israel specializing in Salary calculation, which owned a prevalent [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system for small and medium clients. Throughout this decade, some of Goldstein's earlier investments have reached a size which justified public offerings, and raised funds on The [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] market in [[London]], and on [[Nasdaq]]: [[BluePhoenix|Crystal Software Solutions]] and ''Wiztech'' (later wholly acquired by [[Convergys]]) were the first two greatly successful offerings, followed by [[w:he:מטריקס (חברה)|ForSoft]], the traditional Software Services arm of the group throughout the 90s. Goldstein's holding company, [[Formula Systems]] also started trading on [[Nasdaq]]. He also founded a new Venture Capital Fund, ''Formula Ventures'' headed by Shay Beilis, and acquired a controlling interest in [[Sapiens International Corporation|Sapiens]].{{cn|date=September 2014}}

==Acquisition of Mashov Group==
In 1998 Goldstein acquired control of the [[Mashov Group]]. This publicly traded group of technology companies headed by [[Yaki Dunietz]] and [[David Assia]], consisted of established businesses such as [[Magic Software Enterprises]], [[Babylon (program)|Babylon]], Paradigm Geophysical and [[Walla!]] Communications. This acquisition, combined with the effects of the [[technology bubble]] which resulted in high evaluations of technology companies, brought The Formula Group to evaluations exceeding a Billion Dollars. In February 2000, Goldstein led a secondary public offering of [[Magic Software Enterprises]] on [[Nasdaq]], raising over $100 Million, at a valuation of $750 million. During this period, Goldstein partnered and worked with major players in the world of finance, such as [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Citibank]], and all major Israeli investment banks, Mezzanine funds such as ''FIMI'', ''Shamrock'' (Disney's investment arm), ''Discount Investments'' and many more. By the end of the millennium, Goldstein was by far the most prominent technology-oriented [[entrepreneur]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In March 2000, one month after [[Magic Software Enterprises|Magic Software]]'s successful secondary offering for a record evaluation, the [[technology bubble]] started to burst. Apart from the companies included in the [[Mashov]] portfolio, Goldstein  was not heavily invested in the technology sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein decided to reorganize, and entirely changed the corporate structure of the group he controlled. He consolidated and simplified the complicated multi-level corporate structure, which was a half arbitrary result of many historical and fiscal reasons. Formula Systems remained the top level holding company, with 3 distinct holdings: [[w:he:מטריקס (חברה)|Matrix]] (formerly Forsoft), which merged and acquired all wholly owned group members which were synergetic with its business (including education companies such as ''John Bryce'' and ''Sivan'', hardware companies such as ''2D'', ''Syntech'', software companies such as ''Applicom''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magic Software Enterprises]], and [[Formula Vision]] (formerly Mashov Computers). This reorganization also included sale of holdings (e.g., [[Walla!]] Communications and ''Paradigm Geophysical'', both mature holdings acquired with the [[Mashov Group]]) which were minority holdings, or not synergetic with other group activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Control of the Formula Group was transferred to ''Fimgold'', a partnership between Goldstein and the ''FIMI opportuniti fund'', headed by Ishay Davidi. This move was intended to "contribute to and upgrade the Company’s operations, help in the crystallization of the Company’s new strategy, and at the end of the day will add value to the Company’s shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Goldstein found himself leading a publicly traded corporate pyramid as well as group of young, promising yet struggling companies in the portfolio of Formula Vision. In 2006, he received an offer from [[w:he:אמבלייז|Emblaze]], another public company, run by Guy Bernstein. [[w:he:אמבלייז|Emblaze]] acquired Formula in December of that year, and Goldstein parted from the company he founded and managed for 25 years, in favor of a de facto start-up incubator, Formula Vision.{{cn|date=September 2014}}
==Public office==

Since 2000, Goldstein has been Chairman of The '''Public Companies Association''' in [[Israel]]. As such, he is very involved in legislation and public debate over issues pertaining to subjects such as [[corporate governance]], [[financial regulation]], reporting and [[accounting standards]]. He is a demanded speaker in panels, typically representing corporate business interests.

[[File:Production of cheese 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Industrial [[cheese]] production]]'''Food processing''' is the transformation of agricultural products into [[food]], or of one form of food into other forms.  Food processing includes many forms of processing foods, from grinding [[grain]] to make raw [[flour]] to [[home cooking]] to complex industrial methods used to make [[Convenience food|convenience foods]].

Primary food processing is necessary to make most foods edible, and secondary food processing turns the ingredients into familiar foods, such as bread.

Tertiary food processing has been criticized for promoting [[overnutrition]] and obesity, containing too much sugar and salt, too little fiber, and otherwise being unhealthful.

==Classification==

=== Primary food processing ===
[[File:03 Ban Bang Krathum Bananas.jpg|thumb|These whole, dried [[banana]]s in [[Thailand]] are an example of primary food processing.]]'''Primary food processing''' turns agricultural products, such as raw [[Wheat|wheat kernels]] or livestock, into something that can eventually be eaten.  This category includes ingredients that are produced by ancient processes such as [[Food drying|drying]], [[threshing]], [[winnowing]], and [[Grain mill|milling]] grain, [[Nutshell|shelling nuts]], and [[butchering]] animals for meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wIxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA430|title=Food Processing for Increased Quality and Consumption|last=Grumezescu|first=Alexandru Mihai|last2=Holban|first2=Alina Maria|date=2018-04-08|publisher=Academic Press|year=|isbn=9780128114995|location=|pages=430|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=Measurement, Modeling and Automation in Advanced Food Processing|last=Hitzmann|first=Bernd|date=2017-08-11|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319601113|location=|pages=30–32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also includes deboning and cutting meat, freezing and smoking fish and meat, extracting and filtering oils, [[canning]] food, preserving food through [[food irradiation]], and [[Candling|candling eggs]], as well as [[Homogenized milk|homogenizing]] and [[Pasteurized milk|pasteurizing milk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB9jDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|title=Sustainable Food and Beverage Industries: Assessments and Methodologies|last=Ionescu|first=Gabriela|date=2016-05-25|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781771884112|location=|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7mxV6X9lAYC&amp;pg=PA278|title=Integrated Renewable Resource Management for U.S. Insular Areas: Summary|last=US Congress|first=Office of Technology Assessment|date=June 1987|publisher=US Government Printing Office|year=|isbn=9781428922792|location=Washington, DC|pages=278–281|language=en|chapter=Chapter 8, Technologies Supporting Agricultural, Aquacultural, and Fisheries Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Contamination and [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] problems in primary food processing can lead to significant [[public health]] threats, as the resulting foods are used so widely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, many forms of processing contribute to improved food safety and longer [[shelf life]] before the food spoils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Commercial food processing uses control systems such as [[hazard analysis and critical control points]] (HACCP) and [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) to reduce the risk of harm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Secondary food processing ===
[[File:Baking Bread Communal Oven, 2011.jpg|alt=A man using a bread peel to slide a round disk of raw flatbread dough into a brick oven|thumb|Baking bread is an example of secondary food processing.]]

'''Secondary food processing''' is the everyday process of creating food from ingredients that are ready to use.  [[Bread making|Baking bread]], regardless of whether it is made at home, in a small bakery, or in a large factory, is an example of secondary food processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Fermented fish|Fermenting fish]] and making [[wine]], [[beer]], and other alcoholic products are traditional forms of secondary food processing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Sausage|Sausages]] are a common form of secondary processed meat, formed by [[comminution]] (grinding) of meat that has already undergone primary processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZRCMRXbbwoC&amp;pg=PA599|title=Handbook of Meat and Meat Processing, Second Edition|last=Hui|first=Y. H.|date=2012-01-11|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439836835|location=|pages=599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary food processing ===
'''Tertiary food processing''' is the commercial production of what is commonly called [[processed food]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These are ready-to-eat or heat-and-serve foods, such as [[TV dinner|TV dinners]] and re-heated [[Airline meal|airline meals]].  

==History==
Food processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with [[salt]], and various types of [[cooking]] (such as roasting, smoking, steaming, and oven baking), Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors' diets until the introduction of [[Canning|canning methods]]. Evidence for the existence of these methods can be found in the writings of the ancient [[Aegean civilization|Greek]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldean]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations as well as archaeological evidence from Europe, North and South America and Asia. These tried and tested processing techniques remained essentially the same until the advent of the [[industrial revolution]]. Examples of ready-meals also date back to before the preindustrial revolution, and include dishes such as [[Cornish pasty]] and [[Haggis]]. Both during ancient times and today in modern society these are considered processed foods.[[File:Wakefield, Nebraska Michael Foods plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Michael Foods [[egg (food)|egg]]-processing plant in Wakefield, Nebraska|alt=|left]]

Modern food processing technology developed in the 19th and 20th centuries was developed in a large part to serve military needs. In 1809 [[Nicolas Appert]] invented a hermetic bottling technique that would preserve food for French troops which ultimately contributed to the development of tinning, and subsequently canning by Peter Durand in 1810. Although initially expensive and somewhat hazardous due to the lead used in cans, canned goods would later become a staple around the world. [[Pasteurization]], discovered by [[Louis Pasteur]] in 1864, improved the quality and safety of preserved foods and introduced the wine, beer, and milk preservation.

[[File:Erbswurst-1.jpg|thumb|A form of pre-made [[Pea soup|split-pea soup]] that has become traditional]]
In the 20th century, [[World War II]], the [[space race]] and the rising consumer society in developed countries contributed to the growth of food processing with such advances as [[spray drying]], [[Climbing and Falling Film Plate Evaporator|evaporation]], juice concentrates, [[freeze drying]] and the introduction of artificial sweeteners, colouring agents, and such preservatives as [[sodium benzoate]]. In the late 20th century, products such as dried instant soups, reconstituted fruits and juices, and self cooking meals such as [[MRE]] food ration were developed. By the 20th century, automatic appliances like [[microwave oven]], [[blender]], and [[rotimatic]] paved way for [[convenience cooking]].

In western Europe and North America, the second half of the 20th century witnessed a rise in the pursuit of convenience. Food processing companies marketed their products especially towards middle-class working wives and mothers. Frozen foods (often credited to [[Clarence Birdseye]]) found their success in sales of juice concentrates and  "[[TV dinner]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Levenstein, H: "Paradox of Plenty", pages 106-107. University of California Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Processors utilised the perceived value of time to appeal to the postwar population, and this same appeal contributes to the success of [[convenience food]]s today.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits===
[[File:Processed seafood.jpg|thumb|Processed [[seafood]] - [[fish]], [[squid]], [[prawn]] balls and simulated crab sticks ([[surimi]])]]

Benefits of food processing include toxin removal, preservation, easing marketing and distribution tasks, and increasing food consistency. In addition, it increases yearly availability of many foods, enables transportation of delicate perishable foods across long distances and makes many kinds of foods safe to eat by de-activating spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. Modern [[supermarket]]s would not exist without modern food processing techniques, and long voyages would not be possible.

Processed foods are usually less susceptible to early spoilage than fresh foods and are better suited for long-distance transportation from the source to the [[consumer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When they were first introduced, some processed foods helped to alleviate food shortages and improved the overall nutrition of populations as it made many new foods available to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=Where modern food became available, people grew taller and stronger and lived longer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processing can also reduce the incidence of [[foodborne disease]]. Fresh materials, such as fresh [[produce]] and raw meats, are more likely to harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (e.g. Salmonella) capable of causing serious illnesses.

The extremely varied modern diet is only truly possible on a wide scale because of food processing. Transportation of more exotic foods, as well as the elimination of much hard labour gives the modern eater easy access to a wide variety of food unimaginable to their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=If we fail to understand how scant and monotonous most traditional diets were, we can misunderstand the “ethnic foods” we encounter in cookbooks, at restaurants, or on our travels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of processing can often improve the taste of food significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=For our ancestors, natural was something quite nasty. Natural often tasted bad. Fresh meat was rank and tough, fresh fruits inedibly sour, fresh vegetables bitter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Potted Meat Food Product.jpg|thumb|left|Libby's brand "Potted Meat Food Product"]]
Mass production of food is much cheaper overall than individual production of meals from raw ingredients. Therefore, a large [[profit (economics)|profit]] potential exists for the manufacturers and suppliers of processed food products. Individuals may see a benefit in [[convenience food|convenience]], but rarely see any direct financial cost benefit in using processed food as compared to home preparation.

Processed food freed people from the large amount of time involved in preparing and cooking "natural" unprocessed foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in free time allows people much more choice in life style than previously allowed. In many families the adults are working away from home and therefore there is little time for the preparation of food based on fresh ingredients. The [[food industry]] offers products that fulfill many different needs: e.g. fully prepared [[ready meal]]s that can be heated up in the [[microwave oven]] within a few minutes.

Modern food processing also improves the quality of life for people with allergies, [[diabetes|diabetics]], and other people who cannot consume some common food elements. Food processing can also add extra nutrients such as [[vitamin]]s.

===Drawbacks===
[[File:Meat packages in a Roman supermarket.jpg|thumb|[[Meat]] packages in a Roman [[supermarket]]]]

Processing of food can decrease its nutritional density. The amount of nutrients lost depends on the food and processing method. For example, heat destroys [[Vitamin C#Natural and artificial dietary sources|vitamin C]]. Therefore, canned fruits possess less vitamin C than their fresh alternatives. The [[USDA]] conducted a study of nutrient retention in 2004, creating a table of foods, levels of preparation, and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf|title = USDA Table of Nutrient Retention Factors, Release 6|date = Dec 2007|accessdate = |website = USDA|publisher = USDA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New research highlighting the importance to human health of a rich microbial environment in the intestine indicates that abundant food processing (not fermentation of foods) endangers that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pollan, 'Some of my Best Friends are Germs', New York Times Magazine, 15 May 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/say-hello-to-the-100-trillion-bacteria-that-make-up-your-microbiome.html?hp&lt;/ref&gt;

Using some [[food additive]]s represents another safety concern. The health risks of any given additive vary greatly from person to person; for example using sugar as an additive endangers diabetics. In the [[European Union]], only [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) approved food additives (e.g., sweeteners, preservatives, stabilizers) are permitted at specified levels for use in food products. Approved additives receive an E number (E for Europe), simplifying communication about food additives included in the ingredients' list for all the different languages spoken in the EU.  As effects of chemical additives are learned, changes to laws and regulatory practices are made to make such processed foods more safe.

Food processing is typically a mechanical process that utilizes extrusion, large mixing, grinding, chopping and emulsifying equipment in the production process. These processes introduce a number of contamination risks. Such contaminates are left over material from a previous operation, animal or human bodily fluids, microorganisms, nonmetallic  and metallic fragments. Further processing of these  contaminates will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Example: A mixing bowl or grinder is used over time, metal parts in contact with food will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize [[industrial metal detectors]] to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Food processing does have some benefits, such as making food last longer and making products more convenient. However, there are drawbacks to relying on a lot of heavily processed foods. Whole foods and those that are only minimally processed, like frozen vegetables without any sauce, tend to be more healthy. An unhealthy diet high in fat, added sugar and salt, such as one containing a lot of highly-processed foods, can increase the risk for cancer, [[type 2 diabetes]] and heart disease, according to the World Health Organization.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Added sodium ==
One of the main sources for sodium in the diet is processed foods. Sodium is added to prevent spoilage, add flavor and improve the texture of these foods. Americans consume an average of 3,436 milligrams of sodium per day, which is way more than the recommended limit of 2,300 milligrams per day for healthy people, and more than twice the limit of 1,500 milligrams per day for those at increased risk for heart disease.

== Added sugars ==
While you don't need to limit the sugars found naturally in whole, unprocessed foods like fresh fruit, eating too much [[added sugar]] found in many processed foods can increase your risk for heart disease, obesity, cavities and Type 2 diabetes. The [[American Heart Association]] recommends women limit added sugars to no more than 100 calories, or 25 grams, and men limit added sugars to no more than 155 calories, or about 38.75 grams, per day. Currently, Americans consume an average of 355 calories from added sugars each day.

== Nutrient losses ==
Processing foods often involves nutrient losses, which can make it harder to meet your needs if these nutrients aren't added back through fortification or enrichment. For example, using high heat during processing can cause vitamin C losses. Another example is refined grains, which have less fiber, vitamins and minerals than whole grains. Eating refined grains, such as those found in many processed foods, instead of whole grains may increase your risk for high [[cholesterol]], diabetes and obesity, according to a study published in "[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]" in December 2007.

== Trans fats ==
Foods that have undergone processing, including some commercial baked goods, desserts, margarine, frozen pizza, microwave popcorn and coffee creamers, sometimes contain [[trans fats]]. This is the most unhealthy type of fat, and may increase your risk for high cholesterol, heart disease and stroke. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends keeping your trans fat intake as low as possible.

== Other potential disadvantages ==
Processed foods may actually take less energy to digest than whole foods, according to a study published in "[[Food &amp; Nutrition Research]]" in 2010, meaning you retain more of the calories they contain. Processed foods also tend to be more allergenic than whole foods, according to a June 2004 "Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology" article. Although the preservatives and other food additives used in many processed foods are generally recognized as safe, a few may cause problems for some individuals, including sulfites, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors and flavors, sodium nitrate, BHA and BHT, olestra, caffeine and monosodium glutamate.

==Performance parameters for food processing==
[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|Factory automation - robotics palettizing [[bread]]]]
When designing processes for the food industry the following performance parameters may be taken into account:
* [[Hygiene]], e.g. measured by number of micro-organisms per mL of finished product
* [[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] measured e.g. by “ton of steam per ton of sugar produced”
* [[Waste minimisation|Minimization of waste]], measured e.g. by “percentage of peeling loss during the peeling of potatoes”
* [[Labour economics|Labour]] used, measured e.g. by “number of working hours per ton of finished product”
* Minimization of cleaning stops measured e.g. by “number of hours between cleaning stops”

==Trends in modern food processing==
{{Section OR|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Women working in a cannery.jpg|thumb|Women working in a cannery]]
===Hygiene===
The rigorous application of industry and government endorsed standards to minimise possible risk and hazards. The international standard adopted is [[HACCP]].

===Efficiency===
* Rising energy costs lead to increasing usage of energy-saving technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stacenergy.org/projects/03-stac-01/07-western.htm STAC - Project Information Center - 03-STAC-01 - Western U. S.

'''Richter Gedeon Nyrt.''' is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] company headquartered in [[Budapest]], Hungary. It is one of the largest companies of the industry in the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an region and has operations in over 40 countries.

The company sells products for [[gynecology]], the [[central nervous system]], and [[cardiology]] areas among other therapeutic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actavis.com/news/news/thomson-reuters/actavis-and-gedeon-richter-announce-fda-receipt-of| title=Actavis and Gedeon Richter Plc. Announce FDA Receipt of NDA Resubmission for Cariprazine| date = 6 Jan 2015| website=actavis.com/|accessdate= 13 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was established in Budapest by [[Gedeon Richter (pharmacist)|Gedeon Richter]], a pharmacist, in 1901. The establishment of his firm marked the beginning of the development of the Hungarian [[pharmaceutical]] industry.

Gedeon Richter plc has a primary listing on the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[BUX|BUX Index]]. It had a [[market capitalisation]] of approximately $4 billion as of November 2015, the third largest of any company with a primary listing on the Budapest Stock Exchange. It has secondary listings on [[Euronext]].

==History==
[[File:Richter Gedeon Bp13 KatonaJózsef21.jpg|thumb|left|Founder's memorial plaque]]
[[File:Richter Gedeon croped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gedeon Richter]], the founder of the company]]
[[File:Richter-Gedeon-Nyrt-P5010609.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Production building of the company in Budapest]]
Initially, small-scale pharmaceutical production took place in the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) Pharmacy, which still operates today. Independent pharmaceutical research and production activities were launched in Hungary in those days. However, pharmaceutical production at an industrial scale necessitated heavy investments, and large-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing activities were considered to be extremely capital-intensive operations, even by the established standards in Western countries. Initially, the laboratory that operated on the premises of the pharmacy processed extracts from organs of animals and produced organotherapeutic drugs.

The plant was built in 1907 in the [[Kőbánya]] suburb of [[Budapest]]. In compliance with the established international trends of the pharmaceutical industry in those days, the company produced herbal drugs, processed extracts from plants and manufactured synthetic products at a later date. The company became a highly recognized manufacturer of [[lecithin]] products, antiseptic and febrifuge products, as well as [[painkiller]]s ([[Hydrogen peroxide|Hyperol]], [[Aspirin|Kalmopyrin]], and Tonogen, which continue to be in use).

In 1934, Constant Janssen, of the future [[Janssen Pharmaceuticals]], acquired the distribution rights for Gedeon Richter's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.janssenbelgium.be/en/discover-janssen/a-deer-in-our-heart| title= A deer in our heart| date= 12 May 2014| accessdate= 13 Jan 2015| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20150117204400/http://www.janssenbelgium.be/en/discover-janssen/a-deer-in-our-heart| archivedate= 17 January 2015| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

''' Sir Henry Joseph Kelliher''' (2 March 1896 – 29 September 1991) was a New Zealand businessman, brewer, publisher, managing director, art patron and credit reformer.

==Early life==
Henry Joseph Kelliher (né Keliher) was born in Waikerikeri, near [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] in [[Central Otago]], New Zealand on 2 March 1896; the son of an Irish immigrant Michael Keliher who came to New Zealand during the [[Central Otago Gold Rush|Goldrush in Central Otago]]. Information about his early years is not plentiful but moved to the Wairarapa at the age of 17 to work as a Drover in [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton]] prior to the outbreak of [[World War One]].

==World War One==
When war broke out in Europe in 1914 Kelliher enlisted with the [[Otago Mounted Rifles]] as served as a Trooper until he was transferred during service at [[Gallipoli]] in 1915. Kelliher survived the Gallipoli campaign and served in France at the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] in a specialised Trench Warfare [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] team until he was [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gassed]] and invalided to Britain in 1917.

==Family==
While in Britain recovering from injuries sustained during the War, Kelliher met his to-be wife Evelyn. They were married in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland on 17 July 1917 in the Roman Catholic faith. She had been previously married but widowed at an early age. The family would go on to have 4 daughters and a son, Henry Kelliher Jr, a Painter who pre-deceased his father.
The Kelliher family was survived by several branches including the Rosser and White families of two of his daughters who are currently involved with his charitable Trusts; and the Stephens family, through his son. Kelliher has several dozen grandchildren and great grandchildren around New Zealand, Australia and the rest of the world.

==Business==
By the time the war ended in 1918, Kelliher and his new wife had returned to New Zealand and began farming in the [[Wairarapa]]. He pulled out of farming to invest in the Marquis of Normanby Hotel in [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton]],&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web|author= [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4k5/kelliher-henry-joseph |title=Henry Joseph Kelliher|date= 2014 |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the few licensed drinking venues in the Wairarapa area due to the dry-state that the town of [[Masterton]] had been placed in several years earlier. Through this investment Kelliher began to grow his fortunes and soon began investing in other local drinking establishments and hotels. From 1922 Kelliher chose to base himself in Auckland where he saw the potential for investment opportunities and soon began acquiring agent licenses for key brands of spirit such as [[Dewar's]] White Label Whisky in 1926. He also invested in the New Zealand magazine ''Ladies Mirror'' in which he promoted the rights of progressive women and extolled the rights of women, particularly those widowed young after the war, to engage in education and trade. He also used this magazine to begin his campaign on monetary reform after he took editorial control of the magazine in 1930.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

Unlike many businessmen during this era, it was by 1929–1930 that Kelliher had made an exceptionally comfortable living having not yet reaching 35. He chose however to continue his business ventures, choosing to invest with a [[Otahuhu|South Auckland]] Brewing family run by Morton Coutts. Through this Brewery Henry Kelliher founded the company of [[Dominion Breweries]] which would eventually become a household name in New Zealand. Kelliher used his investment prowess to continue to purchase hotels and other drinking establishments across New Zealand to promote the brands he was creating as well as acquiring other leading international and local beer and spirit brands;&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt; these actions leading to the [[Australian Stock exchange]] considering Dominion Breweries one of the leading enterprises of New Zealand.

Kelliher at this time was considered one of the 10 richest men in New Zealand and was appointed by the [[Michael Savage]] led [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] to act as the Government representative Director on the [[Bank of New Zealand]], prior to its Nationalisation. He served in this capacity from 1936 to 1942, when despite the war, he felt his principles had to take precedence over what he felt was inappropriate financial action on behalf of the Government. During the war his businesses remained steady and ensured that Dominion Breweries kept paying those staffers who had signed up for active war service, something he could no longer undertake due to age and prior injury. He also oversaw the embarkment of several consignments of lager for the servicemen stationed in the Middle east. After the war, Kelliher's business skyrocketed with a market share of approximately 20% of all liquor and other alcohols in New Zealand being from one of his breweries or licensed hotels; it has been opined that Kelliher's actions effectively created the current situation in New Zealand where most drinking establishments are aligned to one major brewery or another despite Dominion Breweries no longer owning the vast majority of the former hotels. By the 1960s DB Breweries was a leading brand and Kelliher although still very active as Managing director of the Company had his eyes on new ventures.

==Philanthropy==

Kelliher has begun his engagement in Philanthropy through the magazine, ''Ladies Mirror'' in the early 1930s but it was in 1956 when he created the Kelliher Art Prize, that this became a leading component of his investment. The prizes consisted of an award of 500 Pounds to those artists that produced what he felt was a great example of New Zealand landscape scenery, from the early 1960s he included a separate non-abstract watercolor painting component of the prize. In 1989 Kelliher stated:

'' I believe it was those early memories of the Central Otago landscape that made me decide, years later, to finance the Kelliher Art Awards, so that our artists here might be encouraged to record the beauty of the country for posterity'' &lt;ref&gt;Rosser. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

This prizes today is considered in mixed light due in part to the considerations by some art critics, such as Hamish Keith, as being detrimental to the growth of New Zealand art due to the strict parameters of the prizes, but other critics have noted that leading New Zealand artists [[Gordon Walters]] and [[Colin McCahon]] were among the winners of the prize. The Art collection is now administered by the Kelliher Art Trust. The Prize was discontinued as an annual award in 1977 due to the growth of [[New Zealand art]] but the Charitable Trust still engages in purchases and the promotion of Exhibitions through his descendants.

Henry Kelliher also established the Kelliher Economic Prize for schools which was initially established in 1963 and is still annually awarded.

For his services to the community he was honoured by the Queen in 1963 during her visit to New Zealand where he was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] for his services to Philanthropy.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt; He was also created a Knight of Justice of the [[Knights of Saint John]] and granted the post nominals KStJ.

==Later life==
Kelliher stepped down from active involvement in Dominion Breweries in 1982, taking on the Honorary title of Founding President. From this time on he mostly remained at Puketutu Island which he had owned since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt; [[Puketutu Island]], in the [[Manukau Harbour]], is a large island, now connected to the mainland off the coast of the [[Auckland airport]]. Here Kelliher had spent several decades raising champion Bulls, Stud Horses and Racing stock such as the former Champion Racehorses [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] and [[Easton Light]] among others of which he used many for stud upon their retirement.&lt;ref name=Hof&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hof.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&amp;ItemId=183&amp;AlphaId=11&amp;CategoryId=3 |title= Addington Raceway Timeline: 1991: Sir Henry Kelliher |author= Ron Bisman |date=  |work=HR Weekly|publisher=Addington Harness Hall of Fame |accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He practised yoga well into old age.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

==Death==

Following his son's early death in 1984 and his wife Evelyn's death in 1986 he withdrew to Puketutu island. He stayed semi-active in the community until his death in September 1991 at the age of 95. He was survived by his daughters, grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren. He was buried in [[Hillsborough Cemetery]] in Auckland overlooking Manukau Harbour and Puketutu Island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9212">'''Kichimatsu Kishi''' (岸 吉松 ''Kishi Kichimatsu'', ?–1956) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrant to the [[United States]] who worked as a farmer and businessman. Along with fellow immigrants from Japan, his impact on rice farming in the southern United States would change the agricultural industry of the region. Kishi would establish an [[agricultural]] colony in [[Southeast Texas]] and would own an oil company. Born as one of eight children to a Japanese banker, he attended [[Hitotsubashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], but was taken from his studies in 1904 to fight in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/6.htm The Japanese Texans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901160958/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/6.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was eventually sent to [[Manchuria]] on the mainland of [[China]] where he remained until the Japanese victory in 1905. He considered remaining there, but the high cost of land and lawlessness prompted him to return to his homeland. Years earlier, [[Sadatsuchi Uchida]] (Japan’s consul to the United States) toured the southern United States in 1902. Uchida reported back to Japan with promising news that the rice farming was underdeveloped and showed potential for large profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/2.htm The Japanese Texans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901160920/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/txtext/japanese/htms/2.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the dense population of Japan and limited workable land meant that many rice farmers would never own their own land. This sparked Kishi’s interest in migrating to the United States in 1906.

==Travel to the United States==
Kishi looked for suitable land, starting in [[California]] and moving on to the [[Carolinas]], and finally discovering the area near the town of Terry in central [[Orange County, Texas]] ideal. Located as one of the stops of the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]], Terry was a [[lumber]] and agricultural town with nearby bayous that could be tapped for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvt19 Handbook of Texas Online - TERRY, TX&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was here that Kishi would establish what is now known as the Kishi Colony. He purchased a land tract of approximately {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} with borrowed money in 1907, and by the following year, his family would reside there with the first rice crop established.&lt;ref name="hvk49"&gt;"[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvk49 Kishi Colony, Texas]" [[Handbook of Texas Online]]. Retrieved on 2009-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]] was dredged for ships nearby, the saltwater of the nearby gulf was allowed to flow into the bayou used to irrigate the rice field, destroying the crop.&lt;ref name="hvk49" /&gt;
Kishi then diversified his farm to grow other vegetables such as cotton, corn, and cabbage. The Kishi Colony attracted other Japanese immigrants from states like California that at the time, prohibited people such as Japanese and other foreigners from owning land there.&lt;ref name="brady2"&gt;[http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/hiddenhistory/Pages1/brady2.htm Japanese Rice Colonies on the Gulf Coast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916153823/http://www.texancultures.utsa.edu/hiddenhistory/Pages1/brady2.htm |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also not uncommon to see people of different heritages such as Mexicans, Cajuns, and African-Americans working within the colony. After the passage of the [[California Alien Land Law of 1913]], many more Japanese would begin to migrate to Texas. Though the Japanese were initially welcomed, hostility arose against their moving in. The [[Texas Legislature]] passed a law similar to California's, but many of the Japanese-Texans had enough political influence to weaken it, while still maintaining their land ownership.&lt;ref name="brady2" /&gt;

==Kishi’s oil business==
The discovery of [[oil]] on the Kishi property in 1919 attracted the interest of [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who in 1921 was touring the United States oil producing facilities in response to Japan’s growing navy. Yamamoto’s meeting with Kishi would help spark his interest in forming the Orange Petroleum Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southeasttexaslive.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13112405&amp;BRD=2287&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=512588&amp;rfi=8 The Beaumont Enterprise - Recalling Kishi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006132848/http://www.southeasttexaslive.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13112405&amp;BRD=2287&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=512588&amp;rfi=8 |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, it seemed Kishi would succeed greatly. He did make enough money to pay back his debtors. During this time Kishi would continue to purchase land. Yamamoto visited the site again in 1924 and found the oil production doing well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Kishi_Colony/Yamamoto.htm Yamamoto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930203502/http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Kishi_Colony/Yamamoto.htm |date=2005-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only several years later, the wells would run dry and the oil venture finally ended in 1925. Afterward, the [[Great Depression]] would also have a negative impact on the Kishi colony.&lt;ref name="terry"&gt;[http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/Terry.htm Old Ghost Town Once Was Home To Great Pioneer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Crop disease along with harsh weather destroyed the produce of the farm. In September 1931, Kishi lost his land to foreclosure. His son Taro, who had been working with a Japanese shipping company at the time, helped support his family by buying a small farm near [[Orange, Texas|Orange]]. The Kishi family managed to lease a portion of their former land as well.

Years later, Kichimatsu Kishi was detained by authorities and kept for two months at Camp Kenedy near [[San Antonio]] after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], most likely due to his previous contact with Yamamoto.&lt;ref name="terry" /&gt; With the influence of the prominent businessmen of Orange such as the Stark and Sims families, he was released back to the community without restriction.

== Taro Kishi ==
Kichimatsu’s son Taro would become [[Texas A&amp;M University]]’s first Asian student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=1a000e53fba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007081103/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=1a000e53fba |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a highly regarded football player, Taro Kishi helped Texas A&amp;M win a [[Southwest Conference]] championship and was one of the early great APA athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Taro_Kishi/A_M.htm A&amp;M&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905231002/http://home.att.net/~hirasaki2/Taro_Kishi/A_M.htm |date=2005-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1926 with a degree in agriculture.

==Markers of recognition and controversy==
The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has constructed a marker on road FM 1135 seven miles (11 km) southeast of [[Vidor, Texas]] in recognition of the accomplishments of Kishi and his colony to the region. In this same area, a road that runs through the central part of [[Orange County, Texas|Orange County]] was named "Jap Lane" years back, supposedly in honor of the Japanese for the positive impact on the agriculture of the region.{{cn|date=November 2016}} However, the word [[Jap]] is now considered a [[racial slur]] and the road's name has been targeted by civil rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacl.org/about_policies_1-1.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002222404/http://www.jacl.org/about_policies_1-1.php |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napost.com/news/community/march/mar30/tanamachi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328081944/http://www.napost.com/news/community/march/mar30/tanamachi.html |archivedate=2006-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2005, [[Orange County, Texas|Orange County]] has changed it to Duncanwoods Lane, Japanese Lane and Cajun Way. In 2007, FM 1135 received a new recognition as "Kishi Road" with a marker.

{{Property law}}

A '''listing contract''' (or '''listing agreement''') is a [[contract]] between a [[real estate broker]] and an owner of [[real property]] granting the broker the authority to act as the owner's agent in the sale of the property.&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listing-agreement.asp | title=Listing Agreement | publisher=Investopedia, LLC | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the broker is a member of the [[National Association of Realtors]], the agreement must include all of the following terms:

#A beginning date and a termination date.
#The ''list price'' at which the property will be offered for sale.
#The amount of compensation offered to the broker, whether it is in the form of a flat fee or percentage of the sales price.
#The terms and conditions under which the brokerage fee shall be paid by the seller.
#Authorizes the broker to co-operate with other brokers as sub-agents or buyer's agents and details the compensation to be offered to those brokers in the event they procure a buyer.
#Authorizes the broker to reveal or not to reveal the existence of offers previously received.

In addition, other terms which may appear in the agreement can include:

*Authorization to the broker to post a sign, to advertise the property, and to put a lockbox on the door, as well seller's obligations to advise the broker on the condition of the property, and broker's obligations to advise the seller about regulations and laws which may affect the sale.

Typically, separate listing agreements exist for the sale of residential property, for land, and for commercial or business property.
&lt;ref name="Emeraldbb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emeraldbb.ca/small-business-for-sale-a-brief-primer/ | title=Things to know before posting business for sale | publisher=Emerald Business Board | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

Upon listing the property, the real estate agency tries to obtain a buyer for the property and, in consideration of successfully finding a satisfactory buyer, the broker anticipates receiving a commission (fee) for the services the brokerage provided.

==Payment of a commission or fee==
Although the terms of the contract could vary, usually the payment of a commission (or fee) to the brokerage is contingent upon:
*the successful negotiation of a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] between a satisfactory buyer and seller and the subsequent ability and willingness of the buyer to close the deal, or
*finding a satisfactory buyer who is ready, willing, and able to pay the full listing price (or more) for the real estate for sale without any contingencies.

If the seller refuses to sell the real estate when one of the above two conditions applies, it is typically considered that the real estate agent has done their job of finding a satisfactory buyer and the seller must still pay the commission, although the details are determined by the listing contract.  Unless [[closing (real estate)|closing]] (or "settlement" or "close of escrow", as it is known in some parts of the country) is a condition of the listing agreement, the buyer's failure to complete the transaction may not require the seller to pay a commission to the broker.

The commission is usually a percentage of the sales price of the property ranging from  2 or 3% up to about 10%, but usually in the range of about 3 - 7% for houses.  The commission could also be a flat fee or some combination of flat fee and percentage, based on the rate you negotiate.  Commission rates and fees are negotiable and not regulated. The average days to sale in your market, advertising, labor costs, length of term, and competition may influence the rate acceptable by the listing real estate broker before entering a listing agreement.

The commission is paid by the seller to the listing real estate broker, who will then compensate their listing agent and any co-operating brokers/agents from this commission by separate agreements with them.

==Listing price and final contract price==
The listing contract typically also includes a '''listing price''' for the property and a date of [[wikt:expiration|expiration]] by which the contract expires.  However, if the property is sold at a lower or higher price, the seller pays a commission at a proportionally lower or higher amount.  If the seller does not accept a price lower than the listing price, then the broker will have to wait until a satisfactory sale to earn the commission.

In the event of multiple offers being presented, the seller may accept whichever offer is most suitable to him/her, even if the price is not the highest.  The percentage commission will be paid according to the accepted price.  The seller, often in concurrence with the real estate agent, may choose to accept an offer that is lower than the highest offer for various reasons, such as terms or contingencies in the purchase contract offered or perceived differences in financial qualification of the competing buyers.

Typically, the real estate agent has the experience and data to determine a suitable listing price for the seller's property and will recommend a listing price to the seller.  The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract.  If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.

==Expiration date==
Listing a property commonly incurs certain expenses for the listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum listing time period to have a good chance of selling the property.  However, the listing contract must have an expiration date.  A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all.  The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale.

==Types of listing contracts==
There can be several types of listing contracts:

*'''Exclusive right to sell''': The seller must pay the brokerage a commission if, by the expiration date in the listing contract, the real estate is sold, regardless of whether the buyer is obtained through the agency or not.  Even if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, a commission is still owed to the brokerage.  Furthermore, the seller cannot list the property with any other broker until the listing expires with the property unsold.

:Brokers who are REALTORS and, thus, are members of [[National Association of Realtors|NAR]] are obliged to enter the property into the local [[Multiple Listing Service|MLS]] system and offer compensation to co-operating brokers.

*'''Exclusive Agency''': The seller can only list the property with one brokerage until the listing contract expires with the property unsold.  The seller must pay the broker a commission if the real estate is sold to a buyer obtained through that brokerage.  By agreement, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.  Since there will be no co-operating broker involved, the property will not be listed in the MLS.
*'''Open Agency''': A seller can enter into an agreement to sell their property with more than one brokerage in open agency listings.  The seller must pay a commission only to the brokerage which brings the buyer for the real estate.  Typically, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.&lt;ref name = "investopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nar3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/handbook-on-multiple-listing-policy/key-definitions/section-3-definitions-of-various-types-of-listing-agreements | title=Section 3: Definitions of Various Types of Listing Agreements | publisher=National Association of Realtors | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Masaru Hayami'''|速水 優|Hayami Masaru|24 March 1925 – 17 May 2009}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] businessman, central banker, the 28th Governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] (BOJ) and a Director of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bilderberg Group]], [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:B6SKChjKuz0J:www.bilderberg.org/bankers.doc+masaru+hayami+bank+of+international+settlements&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjVR14wviPh9d26ycBntH57T4HTQENvXSO08-8eJw35y5ox2wT6WcjrBTJPOtIDxrN8S-45ogO2mGSxFPH2zELBQFXkZUvnUTedUHkbjWAhHtG_gULxjumQae91a3UO-eDRZ1iQ&amp;sig=AHIEtbSLMny6eK-Z_D8Ufy617y7naGq52g  Money-Traders Global Network]; retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hayami was born in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bank of Japan (BOJ), [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/pre_gov/sousai28.htm/  28th Governor]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[The Tokyo College of Commerce]] (now [[Hitotsubashi University]]) in 1947.
 
==Career==
Hayami was Chief Executive Officer of the [[Nissho Iwai]] Corporation,

He served as Governor of the Bank of Japan from March 20, 1998 to March 19, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;BOJ, [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/pre_gov/index.htm/ List of Governors]&lt;/ref&gt;  He took over the top BOJ role in 1998, after Governor [[Yasuo Matsushita]] and Deputy Governor [[Toshihiko Fukui]] resigned in connection with a scandal involving leaks of financially sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Richard A. (2003). {{Google books|bHLC7VOc9JoC|''Princes of the Yen: Japan's Central Bankers and the Transformation of the Economy,'' p. 309 n.27|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Hayami was a controversial BOJ governor because he insisted Japanese politicians must change the structure of the economy before the BOJ could take further measures to end [[deflation]].

He fiercely resisted politicians' demand to loosen monetary policy, thereby increasing the pressure on politicians to reduce stifling regulation, monopolies, and oligopolies in various economic sectors. This strategy stressed Japan's long-term economic health over the short term problems of deflation and recession.

'''Mohammed Farooq Bin Mohammed Aqil Bin Ahmed Al Arshi ''' also known as '''The Great Farooq''' was a member of the [[Farooq]] and Al Arshi Family. A Huwala (Sunni Persian) family, the '''Farooq''' / Faruk or Faruq (Arabic: '''فاروق''') Al Arshi family originates from [[Saudi Arabia]] belonging to the Al Ansar tribe that settled in [[Iran]] in the [[Hormozgan]] Province in the year 1200 Hijri. The family is amongst the first of [[UAE]]’s business and aristocratic families.&lt;ref name=behnam1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behnam|first1=Mariam|author-link=Mariam Behnam|title=Zelzelah: A woman before her time|publisher=Motivate|location=Dubai, UAE|isbn=978-1-873-54452-5|url=https://archive.org/stream/zelzelah00#page/n0/mode/1up|page=19–20|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Farooq's father Al Hajj Mohammed Aqil Bin Ahmed Bin Abdulwahid Al Arshi died, Mohammed Farooq, took over as the head of the family expanding the business internationally and mainly trading in [[diamonds]], [[pearls]] and [[precious stones]].&lt;ref name=behnam1994 /&gt;

Today Mohammed Farooq is remembered as the most famous pearl merchant of Lengeh, Bastak and the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;Willem Floor,"The Persian Gulf: The rise and fall of Bandar-e Lengeh", pg 108-111 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Farooq’s generosity and hospitality earned him respect and a reputable status amongst Gulf royalty.
&lt;ref name=behnam1994/&gt;

As of 2014, the majority of the family members reside in the [[UAE]], [[Bahrain]], Kuwait, and [[Canada]]. The Farooq Al Arshi family has close [[Interpersonal ties|ties]] with the Al Khaldi, fikree and Al Ulama families. The Al Ulamas are also known as the Sheikh Sultan Al Ulama family.

== History and significance ==
[[File:MonroeNearWoodward.jpg|left|thumb|Clear block of Monroe at Woodward, 2008, where the commercial buildings once stood]]

The early buildings on the block were constructed in Victorian commercial style, designed by architects such as Sheldon and Mortimer Smith during the mid-to-late 19th century. The Johnson block, in particular, constituted what was at the time one of the last remaining blocks of pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] buildings in Detroit. In the nearby [[Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District]], the building at 1244 Randolph St. is a rare survivor from the 1840s.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;[http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16068.htm Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151854/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16068.htm |date=2011-06-06 }} from the state of Michigan, retrieved 01/27/11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styled [[List of Odd Fellows buildings|Odd Fellows Building]] (1874) is located at the corner of [[Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District|Randolph]] and Monroe.&lt;ref name=AIADetroit&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hill, Eric J. and John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher= Wayne State University Press | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monroe buildings were occupied by numerous short-term tenants through the years, including grocers, confectioners, and saloons.&lt;ref name = "city"/&gt;  In the early 20th century, a wave of European immigration brought jewelry shops, pawn shops, and tailors to the area.&lt;ref name = "city"/&gt;

At around the same time, the Campus Martius area was developing into the entertainment center of Detroit.&lt;ref name = "ddmp"/&gt;  The [[Detroit Opera House]], then located on the north side of the Campus across Monroe Avenue from the buildings in this district,&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt; anchored the area, and, in 1901, the Wonderland vaudeville theatre moved next door.&lt;ref name = "ddmp"/&gt;

The early 20th century was the dawn of the movie age, and in Detroit it began on Monroe Avenue.  The first movie theater in Detroit, the Casino, was opened on Monroe Avenue in 1906 by [[John H.

In the 1920s, the Detroit cinema hub centered around [[Grand Circus Park]], with nearby Monroe Avenue receiving less attention.&lt;ref name = "ddmp"/&gt;

The district was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975. In early 1990,&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt; most of the aging structures were cleared away, leaving only the National Theater as a reminder of the history of the area.&lt;ref name = "city"/&gt;

John Constantine Williams, a member of one of Detroit's wealthiest mid-19th-century families and son of [[John R. Williams]],&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt; built this structure in 1872-73, directly adjacent to his earlier structure (the first Williams block) at 32-42 Monroe.&lt;ref name = "habs321"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0233 16-30 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-321, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Architect Mortimer L. Smith designed the building.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  The building originally served as an office building, with storefronts on the ground floor.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  In 1880, the upper floors of the building were converted into the Kirkwood Hotel, which survived for a decade under various management.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  The lower floors remained commercial space.  The building reverted to office space in the 1890s, then reopened as the Hotel Campus (later the Hotel Fowler) in 1901.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;

In 1909, most of the building was completely gutted and converted into the 934-seat Family Theater; the Family was converted to show movies in 1914.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  The Family stayed open through much of the century, and was renamed the Follies in 1967.  Six years later, in 1973, the Follies burned to the ground.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  The Follies section of the building (including four of the seven bay Williams Block) was demolished soon thereafter, leaving only the three western-most commercial and retail spaces.  In the late 1970s the city vacated the property,&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt; and the remainder was demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The second Williams Block was five stories tall, divided into bays containing three windows per floor; each floor had slightly different window shapes.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;   The building was constructed of brick, sheathed on the front with sandstone.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  A cast iron cornice and flat roof topped the structure.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;  Belt courses were located above and below windows, and additional decoration consisted of bas relief carvings and cast iron entablatures.&lt;ref name = "habs321"/&gt;

===First Williams Block (32-42 Monroe Avenue)===

[[File:32-42 Monroe Avenue, Detroit 1989.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First Williams Block, 32-34 Monroe, 1989.]]

The first Williams block was built by John Constantine Williams in 1859, and was designed by architect Sheldon Smith.&lt;ref name = "habs322"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0234 32-42 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-322, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was originally used as an office building with commercial space on the first floor.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  In the late 1880s, the building was converted into a 52-room hotel, known first as the Stanwix, then as Gies' European hotel, with a restaurant on the first floor.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  In 1909, the hotel and restaurant was renamed the Berghoff, then the Tuxedo, and, in 1919, the Frontenac.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  The Hotel Berghoff was owned by Wm. D. C. Moebs &amp; Co. who were also the proprietors of the adjoining Berghoff Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ibbotson|first=Patricia|accessdate=May 21, 2011|newspaper=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1913 Wm. D.C. Moebs opened the Cafe Frontenac next to the Hotel Berghoff.  In 1918 the name of the hotel was changed to the Tuxedo Hotel and Grill still under the same owners. The name change was short lived because in 1919 the businesses were called the Frontenac Restaurant and the Frontenac Hotel Company still under the ownership of Wm. D.C. Moebs, President. The Frontenac Hotel remained in business through 1960.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  Wm. D.C. Moebs died November 16, 1921 and the once grand Frontenac Restaurant was sold to pay back taxes in 1923. By 1940, the restaurant had been replaced again with retail space, which remained in the building until the city of Detroit vacated the property in 1978.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  The building was demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The first Williams block was five stories tall, constructed of red brick with a flat roof, and measured 60 feet by 100 feet.  The Monroe Avenue façade was separated into three bays, each with three windows.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  Brick was used decoratively on the façade, and cast iron crowns over the windows and column capitals accented the elevation.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;  The original cast iron cornice was removed in 1942.&lt;ref name = "habs322"/&gt;

===Johnson Block (52-54, 58, 62, 66-68, and 70-72 Monroe Avenue)===
[[File:52-54 Monroe Avenue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|52-54 Monroe in the Johnson Block, 1989.]]

Hiram R. Johnson purchased land along Monroe in 1852 and constructed a series of commercial buildings collectively known as the "Johnson Block."&lt;ref name = "habs324"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0236 52-54 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-324, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  These buildings are the five located at 52-54, 58, 62, 66-68, and 70-72 Monroe Avenue.

All five buildings were constructed of brick and stood four stories tall, and were designed in a similar fashion.&lt;ref name = "habs324"/&gt;  The first four (52-54, 58, 62, 66-68 Monroe) measured 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, with three windows per story on the upper levels.&lt;ref name = "habs324"/&gt;  The last building (70-72 Monroe) measured 30 feet wide and 100 feet deep, and was divided into two bays with two windows per bay on each story.&lt;ref name = "habs328"/&gt;  Windows in all buildings were rectangular in shape with cast iron lintels featuring a scroll and urn motif.&lt;ref name = "habs328"/&gt;  The buildings originally had a cornice at the top;&lt;ref name = "habs325"/&gt;  these were removed in the 20th century, most in 1958.&lt;ref name = "habs325"/&gt; The buildings were demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

Two of these five buildings were instrumental in the establishment of the movie theater business in Detroit.  In 1905, William H Klatt opened a cent-odeon (similar to the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]) in a former furniture store at 62 Monroe.&lt;ref name = "habs326"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0238 62 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-326, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, [[John H. Kunsky]] opened the first true movie house in Detroit, the Casino Theater, two doors away at 70-72 Monroe.&lt;ref name = "habs328"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0240 70-72 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-328, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Klatt quickly converted the Bijou into Detroit's second movie house and reopened it later in 1906 as "The Bijou."  The building remained a movie house for the next seventy years, changing its name to "The New Bijou" in 1918.&lt;ref name = "habs326"/&gt; In 1966, the New Bijou became "The Cinex," an adult movie venue; it closed in 1978.&lt;ref name = "habs326"/&gt;  Kunsky's Casino Theater, however, closed in  1915; later tenants in the space at 70-72 Monroe included the Famous Barrel Bar and Father and Son Shoes.&lt;ref name = "habs328"/&gt;

Tenants of the other Johnson Block buildings were primarily small commercial establishments and eateries.  The tenants of 52-54 Monroe included a series of saloons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a soft drink shop/restaurant from 1913–1928, and a series of clothing and shoe stores until the 1970s, when the building was vacated.&lt;ref name = "habs324"/&gt;  58 Monroe had a series of tenants, including a jewellery store at the turn of the 20th century, followed by a lunch counter, pawn broker, clothing store, and another jewellery store.&lt;ref name = "habs325"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0237 58 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-325, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The building at 66-68 Monroe  housed an umbrella factory from 1888–1912, then a pawnbroker, shoe repair shop, men's clothiers, and a bookstore.&lt;ref name = "habs327"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0239 66-68 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K.

[[File:74-78 Monroe Ave side Detroit MI.jpg|right|thumb|74-78 Monroe, Farmer elevation, 1989]]

The building at 74-78 Monroe was constructed in approximately 1852, fronting on both Monroe Avenue and Farmer Street.&lt;ref name = "habs329"&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.mi0241 74-78 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building)], Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-329, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  At the turn of the 20th century, a restaurant and saloon inhabited the first floor. Later tenants included a tailor, cigar store, and shoe stores.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt;  A barber shop operated continuously in the building from 1915 until the late 1970s, and a second-floor dentist's office existed from the 1920s through the late 1970s.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt; The building was demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The building was originally virtually identical to the structure next door at 70-72 Monroe, including the cast iron lintels featuring an urn and scroll.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt;  The building was, however, set back four additional feet from Monroe Avenue.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt;  The building was four stories tall and constructed of red brick.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt; Both the Monroe Avenue and Farmer Street facades had tall narrow windows with a combination of segmental and fully arched window tops, decorated with projecting brick.&lt;ref name = "habs329"/&gt;

Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-330, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The Star operated for only a year; in 1908 the theater changed into the Theatre Royale, and in 1912 it changed to the Royal Theater.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  The Royal closed in 1922.  Afterward, a variety of retail establishments were housed in the building, including a cigar store, jewelers, shoe store, tailor, and barber.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  The building was demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The Star was a four-story building, measuring 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, constructed of red brick, with yellow brick veneer.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  A large arched window on the Monroe facade fills the third and fourth stories.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  This facade originally had a thick cornice supported by scrolled brackets, and a decorative arch above the entrance.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  Seven rectangular windows per story are on the Farmer elevation.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;  The theater space originally took up both the first and most of the second stories, and thus there was only a single window on the second floor at the rear.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;   However, in 1922 after the closure of the Royal, the second story was extended all the way forward to the Monroe facade, adding windows along the Farmer elevation.&lt;ref name = "habs330"/&gt;

Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-331, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  A saloon was the first tenant, followed by a tea store.  For most of the life of the building, until it was vacated in the 1970s, ground-floor tenants included a lunch room and a clothing or shoe store.&lt;ref name = "habs331"/&gt;  The building was demolished in early 1990.&lt;ref name = "state"/&gt;

The structure was four stories tall, 20 feet wide and 60 feet deep.&lt;ref name = "habs331"/&gt; The building originally had modest Italianate elements.&lt;ref name = "habs331"/&gt;  However, the front facade was reworked in 1923, with the addition of white brick facing and alteration of the windows to large plates of glass.&lt;ref name = "habs331"/&gt;

The 800-seat&lt;ref name="cityscape"/&gt; National Theater, built in 1911, is the only known theatre designed by [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] and the oldest surviving theatre from the city's original theatre district of the 19th century.&lt;ref name = "city"/&gt; It operated as a movie theater until the 1920s, when competition from larger movie houses forced a change to a vaudeville venue.&lt;ref name = "fd"/&gt;  The National survived as a burlesque and adult entertainment theater until it closed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "fd"/&gt;

The '''Norwegian Petroleum Institute''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Petroleumsinstitutt}}) is a Norwegian [[petroleum lobbying]] organization formed in 1970. Its purpose is to "attend to and promote the common interest of the [[petroleum industry|[petroleum] industry]]".&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.np.no/index.php?ID=164&amp;KID=32&amp;SID=39&amp;page=ART&amp;PHPSESSID=bdc23ee4501927794810396dcf85082a About the Norwegian Petroleum Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puerta de Hierro''' ({{IPA-es|ˈpweɾta ðe ˈʝero}}) ("Iron Gate" in [[English language|English]]) is a neighborhood in [[Zapopan, Jalisco|Zapopan]], [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4hoteliers.com/4hots_fshw.php?mwi=3047|title=Guadalajara — Preparing for the Future|date=2008-05-28|publisher=4Hoteliers|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the metropolitan area of [[Guadalajara]]. It was developed through a joint venture by the Leaño family, owners of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara]] and the Gómez Flores family, owners of GIG, Minsa, Grupo Geo and [[DINA S.A.|Dina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=19212&amp;tabla=nacion|title=De "empresario" de sexenio a aspirante priísta|date=2000-04-04|publisher=El Universal|accessdate=2010-04-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615035222/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=19212&amp;tabla=nacion|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighborhood is located on Avenida Patria, in the west-center part of Zapopan, in the northwest part of the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]]. It sits on roughly 500 acres, and includes a residential area, shopping mall, and business district. It is notorious{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2016}} for its affluent population as well as the large amount of [[high-rise]] development in the business district which includes the second-tallest building in the metro area, the ''Aura Altitude'', surpassed only by the [[RIU Hotels|RIU Plaza Hotel]] in south Guadalajara. It is also home to the ''Centro Médico Puerta de Hierro'', one of the most prestigious{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2016}} hospitals in the country, built using private funds and a [[US$]]14.5 million loan from the [[International Finance Corporation]], the private-sector lending arm of the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-136510187/international-finance-corporation-private.html|title=The International Finance Corporation, the private-sector lending arm of the World Bank, announced a US$14.5 million loan to Centro Medico Puerta de Hierro, a new healthcare facility going up in the town of Zapopan, near Guadalajara, Mexico.(MEXICO)|date=2005-09-01|publisher=Revista Latin Trade|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known attraction is the [[Andares Shopping Mall]], a high-end shopping mall located in the southeastern edge of the neighborhood. Andares is one of the most exclusive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2016}} shopping centers in Mexico: a [[US$]]530 million complex, featuring some of the best known brands in the world, such as [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Burberry]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[Dior]], [[Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Swarovski]], and [[Lacoste]]. As part of the complex and the surrounding area, ''the Andares zone'' includes a Hyatt Hotel-condo (construction starting in 2015),{{Update inline|date=February 2016}} luxury residencies designed by Mexican architect [[Juan Sordo Madaleno]], as well as [[Ferrari]], Maserati, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo and Lincoln dealerships. The zone is also home to the new offices of Oracle and U-Fit, one of the most exclusive gyms in Latin America. 

Since the opening of Andares in December 2008, and based on those investments as well as other developments, the property value has been increasing to prices never seen before in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area a continuous trend expected to grow even more. The price of land averages over [[US$]]1,000 per square meter, and the apartments range in prices from US$300,000 to US$2,000,000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

He is the eldest son of the late [[Ng Teng Fong]], the Singaporean real estate billionaire. [[Forbes]] listed the two as the 30th richest people in the world in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_19970715/ai_n10111583|title=Biz Notes|periodical=The Oklahoma City Journal Record|date=15 July 1997|accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2017, Robert, along with his brother Philip Ng, has an estimated net worth of $9.7 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Career==

===History===
Ng was speculating in futures contracts on the [[Hong Kong Futures Exchange]] through two Panamanian-registered companies when the [[Black Monday (1987)|October 1987 global stock market crash]] began; his paper losses reportedly reached HK$1 billion. At first, Ng refused to pay, claiming to be protected by the limited liability of the companies through which he had traded.&lt;ref name="Studwell 2007 116"&gt;{{harvnb|Studwell|2007|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the collapse of the futures exchange; trading was also halted on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] for four days.&lt;ref name="AsiaSentinel"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=788&amp;Itemid=256|periodical=Asia Sentinel|title=Remembrance of Things Past: Hong Kong’s market collapse of 20 years ago is worth recalling during the present turmoil|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by the Commercial Crime Bureau of the [[Hong Kong Police Force|Royal Hong Kong Police]] revealed that Ng had avoided required [[margin call]]s through collusion with one of his brokers.&lt;ref name="Studwell 2007 116"/&gt; However, in the end, no charges were laid against Ng because the colonial government of Hong Kong felt that prosecuting him would pose a risk to overall market stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Studwell|2007|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a deal was worked out which saw Ng repay HK$500 million, with Hong Kong taxpayers providing the rest of the funds needed by the Exchange through a government bailout.&lt;ref name="AsiaSentinel"/&gt; Ng reportedly lost a total of US$250 million in his various investment holdings as a result of the crash.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

In June 1995, Ng took over as chairman of [[Yeo Hiap Seng]] (YHS), a [[Singapore Exchange|Singapore-listed]] food and beverages company which had lost US$3.2 million in its previous year of operation. His chairmanship came at the same time as his family increased its stake in the company to 24.9%, just short of the 25% threshold above which they would be required by law to make an offer to buy out all other shareholders. This marked a step forward in his fight with Malaysian billionaire investor [[Quek Leng Chan]] for control of YHS and its land holdings in Singapore's [[Bukit Timah]] district, which could be worth billions of dollars were they redeveloped into residential real estate.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{citation|periodical=CNN Asianow|title=Tea for Two: Battle for a Great Name and Address|date=28 July 1995|accessdate=5 June 2009|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/95/0728/biz1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206205421/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/95/0728/biz1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Ng and his father were able to successfully take advantage of squabbles within the Yeo family to buy up 86% of YHS' stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Backman|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their battle to gain control of the company was later described as "one of the most colourful take-over struggles in Singapore history" and led to YHS' transformation from a food company to a [[luxury real estate]] developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=49635&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19970601|date=1 June 1997|accessdate=15 July 2009|periodical=The Standard|title=Transforming a soft-drink sluggard|last=Porter|first=Barry|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130107164550/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=49635&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19970601|archivedate=7 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sino Group also spun off their hotel interests into a new company, [[Sino Hotels]], in that year; Ng became chairman of the board of the new company as well from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Sino Hotels (Holding) Limited|url=http://www.sino.com/Cht/default.asp?xid=about_mg_shl#001|title=Management profile|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1997, under Ng's direction, Sino Hotels made several acquisitions, including an 80% stake in the local branch of the [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad Hotel]] for HK$2 billion. Ng also predicted that office properties would perform well during that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB854303243380530000?mod=googlewsj|periodical=The Wall Street Journal|last=Guyot|first=Erik|date=27 January 1997|accessdate=16 July 2009|title=Ng to Continue Prowl For Land in Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter six months of that year, Sino Hotels reported a 66% fall in net interim profits and 80% fall in operating profit, which Ng attributed to lower contributions not just from hotels but from the company's Fortune chain of Chinese restaurants as well. However, the Conrad proved to be a resilient investment, with the average room rate increasing by 14.7% during the months in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=6295&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19980319 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130107175012/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=6295&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19980319 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2013 |periodical=The Standard |date=19 March 1998 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |title=Tourism slump hits Sino Hotel earnings |first=Bayani |last=Cruz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positions===

==Voting and political views==
Due to his business positions, Ng wields a significant amount of power under Hong Kong's [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] system. In 1998, he and companies owned by Sino Group controlled roughly 3–4% of the votes in the real estate constituency, and an additional two votes in the tourism constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rights Group Attacks Electoral System|periodical=South China Morning Post|date=4 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRM"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor|title=Corporate Voting is Highly Corrupt|date=December 1998|accessdate=14 July 2009|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk/english/reports/enw/enw1298b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting power he wields through this system has been described as equivalent to anywhere from 6,100 to 15,940 votes in geographic constituencies, which has led to criticism by the ''[[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]]''.&lt;ref name="HRM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callick|1998|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ng has spoken out in support of the "Application List" system for the sale of government land and in 2008 remained publicly optimistic about the prospects for the Hong Kong property market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Ta Kung Pao |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |title=黃志祥讚勾地多元化 |url=http://www.takungpao.com/news/08/03/02/GW-871522.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514022522/http://www.takungpao.com/news/08/03/02/GW-871522.htm |archivedate=14 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Ng is married to Yeoh Saw Kheng (楊素瓊) a fellow ethnic [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese]] of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] descent, who is the 3rd daughter of Dr [[Yeoh Ghim Seng]], the former Speaker of Parliament of Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=黃志祥家族谷草旺 |periodical=Apple Daily |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009 |url=http://hk.mark6.atnext.com/template/racing/art_main.cfm?sec_id=3403908&amp;showdate=20090211&amp;art_id=12188550 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716130841/http://hk.mark6.atnext.com/template/racing/art_main.cfm?sec_id=3403908&amp;showdate=20090211&amp;art_id=12188550 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ng's eldest son [[Daryl Ng|Daryl Ng Win Kong]] (黃永光) was born in 1978. He holds Singaporean citizenship and joined the [[National Service in Singapore|mandatory military service]]; at the same time, he speaks passionately about his Hong Kong root and childhood spent in Hong Kong, reminding that he was born at [[Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital]] and attended [[Diocesan Boys' School]] rather than an [[international school]] in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.takungpao.com/news/09/06/21/EP-1100906.htm |periodical=Ta Kung Pao |date=21 June 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009 |title=香港富豪第三代表現受關注/Performance of Hong Kong's third-generation tycoons closely watched |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801062543/http://www.takungpao.com/news/09/06/21/EP-1100906.htm |archivedate=1 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied in the United States, where he graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 2003, and after two years as a project manager in Sino Group was appointed an executive director in 2005. He is generally expected to be his father's successor.&lt;ref name="Autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://financenews.sina.com/mingpao/000-000-107-104/404/2008-07-31/1612328512.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129050404/http://financenews.sina.com/mingpao/000-000-107-104/404/2008-07-31/1612328512.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2010 |periodical=Ming Pao |date=31 July 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2009 |title=Citywalk開幕 信和接班人出席/Sino heirs appear at Citiwalk opening }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he began to take a more public role, first appearing at a land auction with his father in October that year. During his first time speaking with the media about the property market in March 2008, he spoke only briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Ming Pao Finance|title=信和太子爺首評樓市 講完即閃/Sino prince's first time discussing the property market; finishes speaking and immediately disappears|url=http://www.mpfinance.com/htm/Finance/20080329/News/ek1_ek1b1.htm|date=29 March 2008|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has spoken on various occasions and has taken up public duties.  He advocates sustainability and heritage, and champions projects like mini hydro power,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/1337385/sino-land-boss-daryl-ng-trials-mini-turbines-taps-generate Sino Land boss Daryl Ng tries mini-turbines in taps to generate electricity], ''SCMP'', 23 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; food waste management, Tai O Heritage Hotel in Hong Kong and The Fullerton Heritage in Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Rodryg Dunin''' (June 26, 1870 – October 26, 1928) was a [[Poland|Polish]] noble ([[szlachta]]), a [[hrabia]] ([[Count]]), and an [[industrialist]] and [[agriculturalist]].&lt;ref name="PSB"&gt;[[Polski Słownik Biograficzny]] (the Polish Biographical Dictionary) 1948 - Tome 6, Subtome 1 ([http://www.psb.pan.krakow.pl/past_issues/past_issues.html list of tomes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031224151910/http://www.psb.pan.krakow.pl/past_issues/past_issues.html |date=2003-12-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt;  His work in agricultural industry, including pioneering new techniques, earned him recognition among the [[farming]] circles of early 20th century [[Greater Poland]].&lt;ref name="PSB" /&gt;

== Biography ==
[[Image:Granowko.jpg|thumb|right|Rodryg and Lucia's home in [[Granówko]], [[Kościan County]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://dworki.3k.pl/album.php?dworek=55 Count Rodryg Dunin's estate] - Dwory Polskie (Polish Courts)&lt;small&gt;Translation of picture caption: Granówko, [[Kościan County]]. Count Rodryg Dunin's estate. Formerly the seat of the [[Nieżychowski]] family, since 1898 in the hands of the current owner. The mansion, comfortable and spacious, was built in the first half of the previous century by Nepomucen Nieżychowski, the estate's owner at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Rodryg Dunin was born in [[Marszewo, Kreis Pleschen|Marszewo]], [[Kreis Pleschen]], [[Province of Posen]], to Stanisław Tadeusz Dunin (a participant in the 19th century [[January Uprising]]), and Maria-Antonina Baranowska (daughter of the [[Poznań]] playwright [[Agnieszka Baranowska]]). He was a student at [[Maria Magdalena Gymnasium]] (high school) in [[Poznań]], where he participated actively in a secret Polish educational-social youth movement, and later studied at academies in [[Děčín|Tetschen (Děčín)]], [[Bohemia]], and [[Leipzig]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]].&lt;ref name="PSB" /&gt;

He married Lucia (Łucja) Taczanowska (1862-1917), the widow of Stanisław Nieżychowski (1851-1897), and became the stepfather of her six children{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. Among his own children by the marriage was [[Antoni Dunin|Stanisław Antoni Piotr Dunin]], an army officer who received the [[Virtuti Militari]] award.&lt;ref name="PSB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="virtuti"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Wesolowski | first =Z | title = Polish Order of the Virtuti Militari Recipients (1792-1992) | publisher = Federation of East European Family History Societies | date = February 5, 1998 | url = http://feefhs.org/PL/vm/vm-d.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estate ==
Rodryg Dunin's estate was in [[Granówko]], [[Kreis Kosten]]. Formerly the seat of the [[Nieżychowski]] family, it came into the hands of the Dunins following the 1898 marriage. The mansion was built by Nepomucen Nieżychowski, who owned the estate at the time. In 1923, he  passed Granówek to his oldest stepson, Józef Nieżychowski, and bought the [[Ruchocice]] manor near [[Grodzisk Wielkopolski]] from Tiedemann, an [[German Eastern Marches Society|HKT]] member.&lt;ref name="PSB"/&gt; Dunin would later use Ruchocice to provide an [[orphanage]] aiming to protect Polish children from [[Germanization]].&lt;ref name="PSB" /&gt;

==Industry and agriculture==
Dunin played an important role in Greater Poland agricultural-industrial organizations, including serving as a councillor of the [[Poznańskie Ziemstwo Kredytowe]] and holding seats on the boards of numerous institutions.&lt;ref name="PSB" /&gt; His capacity to both introduce new techniques and to balance with tradition earned him a reputation among Polish farmers for modernity and innovation. He founded an [[alcohol factory]], local train, and in 1912 installed the first rain-based [[irrigation system]] in the [[Poznań]] area. He mentored young farmers and was invited to lecture in contemporary centers of farmer education, both in Poznań and [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="PSB"/&gt;

The '''St. Louis Cardinals''' are an American [[professional baseball]] team based in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. The Cardinals compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League Central|Central]] division. [[Busch Stadium]] has been their home [[baseball park|ballpark]] since 2006. One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the Cardinals have won 11 [[List of World Series champions|World Series championships]], the second-most in Major League Baseball (behind the [[New York Yankees]]) and the most in the National League. Their 19 [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennants]] rank third in NL history. In addition, St. Louis has won 13 [[Major League Baseball division winners|division titles]] in the [[National League East|East]] and Central divisions.

While still in the old [[American Association  (19th century)|American Association]] (AA), named then as the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]], the team won four AA league championships, qualifying them to play in the professional baseball championship tournament  (a [[List of pre-World Series baseball champions|forerunner]] of the modern  [[World Series]], established 1903) of that era. They tied in [[1885 World Series|1885]] and won outright in [[1886 World Series|1886]] and lost in [[1888 World Series|1888]] for the early trophy [[Hall Cup]] versus the New York Giants.&lt;ref name="Cardinals franchise index"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/ |title=St. Louis Cardinals Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others both times against the [[Chicago Cubs]] (originally the [[Chicago White Stockings]] then), in the first meetings of the [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry]] between nearby cities of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] that continues to this day.

With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis and the nation, entrepreneur [[Chris von der Ahe]] purchased a [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] club in 1881, then known as the '''Brown Stockings''', and established them as charter members of the old [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (AA) base ball league which played 1882 to 1891, the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the continuing [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs]], later known simply as the National League, (organized in 1876), in 1892; at that time, they were called the '''Browns''' (not to be confused with a later team also known as the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] in the [[American League]], 1902-1953) and also as the '''Perfectos''' before they were officially renamed eight years later as the '''Cardinals''' in 1900. The name refers to the bird called "Cardinal", which is the team's mascot, rather than to the senior Catholic Church officials so named.

Cardinals achievements that have impacted MLB and sports events in general include manager/owner [[Branch Rickey]]'s pioneering of the [[farm team|farm system]], [[Rogers Hornsby]]'s two batting [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]], [[Dizzy Dean]]'s 30-[[Win–loss record (pitching)|win]] season in [[1934 Major League Baseball season|1934]], [[Stan Musial]]'s 17 MLB and 29 NL records, [[Bob Gibson]]'s 1.12 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]], [[Whitey Herzog]]'s [[Whiteyball]], [[Mark McGwire]] breaking the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|single-season home run record in 1998]], and the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|2011 championship team's]] unprecedented comebacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eis99|Eisenbath 1999]]: 251&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals have won 105 or more games in four different seasons and won 100 or more a total of nine times. Cardinals players have won 20 [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|league MVPs]], four batting Triple Crowns, and three [[Cy Young Award]]s. [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductees include [[Lou Brock]], [[Dizzy Dean]], [[Bob Gibson]], [[Whitey Herzog]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Joe Medwick]], [[Stan Musial]], [[Branch Rickey]], [[Red Schoendienst]], [[Ozzie Smith]], and [[Bruce Sutter]].

In 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' valued the Cardinals at $1.9 billion, making them the 7th-most valuable franchise in MLB; their revenue the previous year was $319 million, and their [[Earnings before interest and taxes|operating income]] was $40.0 million.&lt;ref name=forbes2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes2016&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals |title=St. Louis Cardinals |work=[[Forbes]] |date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals |title=St. Louis Cardinals |work=[[Forbes]] |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their purchase in 1995, [[List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives|owner]] [[William DeWitt, Jr.]]'s investment group has seen enormous growth from the $147 million purchase price.

{{Main article|History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1875–1919)}}

===Before the Cardinals (1875–1881)===
Professional baseball began in St. Louis with the inception of the '''[[St. Louis Brown Stockings|Brown Stockings]]''' in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] (NA) [[1875 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|in 1875]]. The NA folded following that season, and [[1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|the next season]], St. Louis joined the [[National League]] as a charter member, finishing in third place at 45-19. [[George Bradley]] hurled the first [[no-hitter]] in [[List of Major League Baseball no-hitters|Major League history]]. The NL expelled St. Louis from the league [[1877 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|after 1877]] due to a game-fixing scandal and the team went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cas02|Cash 2002]]: 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Without a league, they continued play as a semi-professional [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] team through 1881.

The magnitudes of the reorganizations following the 1877 and 1881 seasons are such that the 1875–1877 and 1878–1881 Brown Stockings teams are not generally considered to share continuity as a franchise with the current St. Louis Cardinals.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/ |title=St. Louis Cardinals Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |work=Baseball Reference |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/S/FR_SLN.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals (1882–2013) |work=Retrosheet |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Association and early National League eras (1882–1919)===

[[1883 St. Louis Browns season|The next season]], St. Louis shortened their name to the '''Browns'''. Soon thereafter they became the dominant team in the AA, as manager [[Charlie Comiskey]] guided St. Louis to four pennants in a row from [[1885 St. Louis Browns season|1885]] to [[1888 St. Louis Browns season|1888]].&lt;ref name= "Cardinals franchise index"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Comiskey managerial record"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/comisch01.shtml |title=Charlie Comiskey Managerial Record| accessdate=March 26, 2013| publisher= Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pitcher]] and [[outfielder]] [[Bob Caruthers]] led the league in [[Earned run average|ERA]] (2.07) and [[Win–loss record (pitching)|wins]] (40) in 1885 and finished in the top six in both in each of the following two seasons.  He also led the AA in [[on-base percentage|OBP]] (.448) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.974) in [[1886 St. Louis Browns season|1886]] and finished fourth in [[batting average]] in [[1886 St. Louis Browns season|1886]] (.334) and fifth in [[1887 St. Louis Browns season|1887]] (.357).&lt;ref name="Bob Caruthers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/carutbo01.shtml |title=Bob Caruthers player page |work= Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outfielder [[Tip O'Neill (baseball)|Tip O'Neill]] won the first batting [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|triple crown]] in franchise history in 1887 and the only one in AA history.&lt;ref name="Tip O'Neill"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/o'neiti01.shtml |title=Tip O'Neill player page |work= Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neill awards"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/awards.php?p=oneiti01 | title=Tip O'Neill awards | work= Baseball Almanac | accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB triple crowns"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/triple_crowns.shtml | title=MLB Triple Crown Winners | work= Baseball-Reference.com | accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By winning the pennant, the Browns played the NL pennant winner [[List of pre-World Series baseball champions|in a predecessor]] of the [[World Series]].  The Browns twice met the Chicago White Stockings – the ''[[Chicago Cubs]]'' prototype – [[1885 World Series|tying one]] in a heated dispute and [[1886 World Series|winning the other]], thus spurring the vigorous [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry|St. Louis-Chicago rivalry]] that ensues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon David|last=Cash|title=Before They Were Cardinals: Major League Baseball in Nineteenth-Century|location=St. Louis|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the franchise's ten seasons in the AA, they compiled an all-time league-high of 780 wins and .639 winning percentage.  They lost just 432 contests while tying 21 others.&lt;ref name="Cardinals franchise index"/&gt;

[[Image:Rogers Hornsby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rogers Hornsby]] won two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]] as a Cardinal.&lt;ref name="MLB triple crowns" /&gt;]]
The AA went bankrupt after the 1891 season and the Browns transferred to the National League.  This time, the club entered an era of stark futility.  Between [[1892 St. Louis Browns season|1892]] and [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1919]], St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, finished in last or next-to-last place sixteen times, and ended four seasons with 100 losses or more.

===Previous ballparks===
Busch Stadium is the Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third to bear that name.  The Cardinals' original home ballpark was [[Sportsman's Park]] from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] and were known as the Browns.  [[1893 St. Louis Browns season|In 1893]], the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920.  The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as [[Robison Field]].&lt;ref name="Timeline1" /&gt; Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the [[St. Louis Browns]].  In 1953, the [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]] purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for [[Baltimore]] after the season. The Cardinals built [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.&lt;ref name="Timeline4" /&gt; It was built as the [[multi-purpose stadium]] home of both the baseball Cardinals and the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|NFL football Cardinals]], who are now the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.

===Spring training===
The Cardinals home field in [[spring training]] is [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].  They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the [[Miami Marlins]].  Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals hosted spring training at [[Al Lang Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] from 1937 to 1997.

===Regular season home attendance===
The Cardinals have exceeded the attendance total of 3 million every season since 2004.

==Logos and uniforms==
The Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time.  The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking "SL" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900.  Those early uniforms usually featured the name "St. Louis" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal red]] accents.  In 1920, the "SL" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill.

[[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1929-1948 logo.png|thumb|left|The original "birds on the bat" logo, which first appeared in 1922.]]
In 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured the two familiar [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] birds perched on a [[baseball bat]] over the name "Cardinals" with the letter "C" of the word hooked over the bat.  The concept of the birds originated after [[List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], at which he was speaking.  The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt.  Schmidt's father, a [[graphic designer]], helped Ricky make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Getzenburg|first=Alaina|title=Schmidt's vision inspired iconic red bird logo|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/allie-may-schmidt-inspired-cardinals-logo/c-254904614|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colloquially referred to as the "birds on the bat", it initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and "Cardinals" in printed letters.  An alternate version of this logo with "St. Louis" replacing "Cardinals" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before "Cardinals" returned.  In 1940, the now-familiar "{{sm|StL}}" logo was introduced on the team's caps.  The interlocking "{{sm|StL}}" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since.  The first appearance of the "STL" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color.  From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking "{{sm|StL}}" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents.  In 1951, the "birds on the bat" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat.&lt;ref name="Cardsunis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?lowYear=1882&amp;highYear=2008&amp;city=St.%20Louis&amp;league=NL&amp;sort=year&amp;increment=18&amp;pos=19 | title=Cardinals uniforms | work=Baseball Hall of Fame Uniform Database | accessdate=May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1998-present logo.png|thumb|right|The current "birds on the bat" logo introduced in 1998 (although variations of this have been used since 1957).]]

In 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red "{{sm|StL}}", removing the red bill.  Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script "Cardinals" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the "birds on the bat."  An updated version of the "birds on the bat" logo returned in 1957 with the word "Cardinals" written in cursive beneath the bat.  In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team to display players' names on the back of their jerseys.  In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1964_stlouis.gif&amp;Entryid=1045 home caps] to all red with a white interlocking "{{sm|StL}}".  The next year, the [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1965_stlouis.gif&amp;Entryid=1065 red caps] were the only cap worn by the team full-time. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997.

In 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and beltless elastic waist pants. In 1973, the crew-neck collar became a V-neck. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976 to 1984. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts.  That same year, they also brought back the all-navy cap with a red "{{sm|StL}}" on the road (which were last worn in 1964) only while wearing the same red and white cap for home games only.  
In 1998, the "birds on the bat" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters.  That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn only on Sunday home games.  The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version.  Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.&lt;ref name="Cardsunis" /&gt;

On November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season.{{update after|2013|04|30}}  The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which "St. Louis" will be used instead of "Cardinals" and retained the "birds on the bat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Langosch|first=Jenifer|title=City is key to Cardinals' alternate home jersey|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&amp;content_id=40305046&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;c_id=stl|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=November 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119103550/http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&amp;content_id=40305046&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;c_id=stl|archivedate=November 19, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main uniform for both home and away games; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly against other red-capped teams. Over the years, the Cardinals have released various marketing logos depicting [[anthropomorphized]] cardinals in a pitching stance, swinging a baseball bat, or wearing a baseball cap that never became part of the game uniform.&lt;ref name="Cardsunis" /&gt;

Starting with the 2019 season, the Cardinals will wear updated powder blue alternate uniforms during Saturday road games. Like the Saturday home cream alternates, it features red piping and "St. Louis" below the "birds on the bat" logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clair|first=Michael|title=The Cardinals brought back the powder blue jerseys with -- get this -- buttons!|url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/cardinals-unveil-throwback-powder-blue-jerseys/c-300904202|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=November 19, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Fredbird|Rally Squirrel}}
The team mascot is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform named [[Fredbird]]. He is assisted by [http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/fan_forum/team_fredbird.jsp Team Fredbird], a group of eleven women who entertain fans from the field and on top of the dugouts.

While unofficial, the Rally Squirrel became an unexpected phenomenon during the 2011 postseason.  Making its "debut" in Game 3 of the [[2011 National League Division Series|NLDS]] on Oct 4, a squirrel ran across home plate in the middle of a pitch from [[Roy Oswalt]] of the Phillies to the Cardinals' [[Skip Schumaker]].  The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 (Oct. 7) in Philadelphia to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's "role" in the victory.  The squirrel was popularized as "Buschie the Rally Squirrel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Crystal |url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/15640350/busch-takes-steps-to-remove-squirrel |title=Fans hope Buschie the Rally Squirrel is good luck – KFVS12 News &amp; Weather Cape Girardeau, Carbondale, Poplar Bluff |publisher=Kfvs12.com |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally Squirrel is also included on the official [[World Series ring]]s the team received. It shows up under the "STL" logo on the side of the ring.

Fredbird sparked controversy in May 2015, when he was asked by a fan for a photograph and handed him a sign that said "Police Lives Matter". The team later claimed that Fredbird should not be involved in any political activity or social commentary.

===Rivalries===

====Chicago Cubs====
{{main article|Cardinals–Cubs rivalry}}
The Cardinals–Cubs rivalry refers to games between the Cardinals and the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The rivalry is also known as the '''Downstate Illinois rivalry''' or the '''I-55 Series''' (in earlier years as the '''Route 66 Series''') as both cities are located along [[Interstate 55]] (which itself succeeded the famous [[U.S. Route 66]]). The Cubs lead the series 1,134–1,103 through June 22, 2016, while the Cardinals lead in [[National League]] pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 17. The Cubs have won 11 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901–present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' pennants have been won since 1926. The Cardinals also have an edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. Games featuring the Cardinals and Cubs see numerous visiting fans in either [[Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis or  [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/01/cubs-cardinals-must-emulate-yankees-red-sox-to-rekindle-rivalry.html|title=Cubs, Cardinals Must Emulate Yankees, Red Sox to Rekindle Rivalry|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011|first=Tony|last=Lee|work=NESN}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the National League split into two and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years.  The Cardinals and Cubs have played each other once in the postseason, when the Cubs beat the Cardinals 3 games to 1 in the 2015 National League Division Series.

===Ownership and valuation===
An investment group led by [[William DeWitt, Jr.]] owns the St. Louis Cardinals, having bought the team from [[Anheuser-Busch]] (AB) in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://stlcardinals.scout.com/2/824267.html |work=Scout.com |title=In defense of DeWit &amp; Company |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622033510/http://stlcardinals.scout.com/2/824267.html |archivedate=June 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a "small market", which appears to handicap a club's competitiveness.  Such was the case when [[Sam Breadon]] put the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: [[List of National League presidents|then-NL President]] [[Ford Frick]] proposed moving the Cardinals to [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Baseball's Sign"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-26/sports/9512260211_1_dewitt-group-anheuser-busch-cos-joan-kroc |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Baseball's Sign of the Times: Under New Ownership |date=December 26, 1995 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="Cards put up for sale"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19951027&amp;id=1ElWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6295,6351993 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |title=Anheuser-Busch Puts Cardinals Up for Sale |date=October 26, 1995 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's [[Drew Baur]], Hanser and DeWitt, Jr.&lt;ref name="Baseball's Sign" /&gt;  Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group.&lt;ref name="Judd2002"&gt;[[#Jud02|Judd 2002]]: 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Baur's group then sold the garages to another investment group, lowering the net franchise purchase price to about $100 million, about $10 million less than ''[[Financial World]]'s'' value of the team at the time $110 million.&lt;ref name="Cards put up for sale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cards owners' value"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2001/05/07/story2.html?page=all |work=St. Louis Business Journal |title=Cards owners worth $4 billion |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current [[Cincinnati Reds]] owners [[Bob Castellini]] and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's purchase of the team.  To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, totaling an estimated thirteen percent.  At that time, the ''Forbes'' valued the Cardinals at about $370 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/11/21/story7.html?page=all |work=St. Louis Business Journal |title=Cardinals group to buy up departing owners' stakes |date=November 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after reabsorbing that stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available to new investors in 2010.  Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not reached the threshold to trigger that obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/dewitt-iii-defends-cardinals-releases-owner-names/article_a04234e6-021e-11e0-910d-00127992bc8b.html |work=St. Louis Business Journal |title=DeWitt III defends Cardinals; releases owner names |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent annual financial records====
As of 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' valued the Cardinals seventh among 30 MLB franchises. Their estimated value of $1.90 billion was an increase of $100 million from the season before, when they ranked seventh. St. Louis' revenue in 2018 was $319 million, up $9 million. Their [[Earnings before interest and taxes|Operating income]] was $40.0 million.&lt;ref name=forbes2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals |title=St. Louis Cardinals |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 11, 2018 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals' deal with [[Fox Sports Midwest]], signed in 2015, begins in 2018, and is worth $1 billion through 2032.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2017/04/11/baseball-team-values-2017/ |title=Baseball Team Values 2017 |author=Mike Ozanian |work=Forbes |date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2016/03/23/baseballs-most-valuable-teams/#5ac392301ddd |title=Baseball's Most Valuable Teams |work=[[Forbes]] |author=Mike Ozanian |date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2014&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlm45fdgdd/8-st-louis-cardinals/ |title=St. Louis Cardinals – in photos: MLB valuations |work=[[Forbes]] |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2013&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals/ |work=Forbes |title=#10 St. Louis Cardinals |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''Forbes'' valued the Cardinals at $820 million and opined previously that they play "in the best single-team baseball market in the country and are among the league's leaders in television ratings and attendance every season."&lt;ref name=Forbes2013/&gt;  Concurrent with the growth of [[Major League Baseball]], the Cardinals value has increased significantly since the Baur-DeWitt purchase. In 2000, the franchise was valued at $219 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.privco.com/private-company/st-louis-cardinals-llc |work=Privco |title=St. Louis Cardinals, LLC |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a growth rate of 374% through 2014. The franchise's value grew 12.7% from 2013 to 2014.
The ''Forbes'' methodology of team values are enterprise values (equity plus net debt) that include the economics of the ballpark but exclude the value of real estate itself. Forbes does not include the value of team-owned regional sports networks. The league's ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media (100%) and the MLB Network (67%) and league's investment portfolio are included in our values. In total, these three assets constitute about $425 million in value for each team. Revenue and operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) measure cash in versus cash out (not accrual accounting) for the 2017 season. Their figures include the post-season and are net of revenue sharing and stadium debt payments. Revenues include the pro-rated upfront bonuses networks pay teams as well as proceeds from non-MLB events at the ballpark. The non-recurring $18 million each team received in 2017 from the sale of a stake in BamTech to Walt Disney was excluded, as were profits or losses from team-owned RSNs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/04/11/baseball-team-values-2018/#e4d1b593fc09 |title=Baseball Team Values 2018 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum====
{{main article|St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum}}
In 2014, the Cardinals announced the reopening of the franchise Hall of Fame after a 6-year hiatus.  A formal selection process recognizes former players as Cardinals Hall of Famers each year.  To be eligible for election, a player must have been a member of the Cardinals for at least three seasons.  The team initially released the names of 22 former players and personnel included in the inaugural class of [[2014 St. Louis Cardinals season|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cardinals establish Hall of Fame &amp; detail induction process|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140118&amp;content_id=66822534&amp;vkey=pr_stl&amp;c_id=stl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126165854/http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140118&amp;content_id=66822534&amp;vkey=pr_stl&amp;c_id=stl|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 26, 2014|publisher=St. Louis Cardinals|date=January 18, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now 40 members of the Cardinals Hall of Fame.

This practice had begun with the Cleveland Indians in 1920. Thus, Hornsby had no number to retire.

'''Notes:'''
* '''Hornsby:'''  When honored in [[1937 St. Louis Cardinals season|1937]], '"SL"' was used in place of a number as he played mostly in an era without numbers.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''42:'''  [[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42 was retired throughout baseball in 1997.  The Cardinals again retired 42 in [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|September 2006]] in honor of Sutter, who was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year.
* '''85:'''  Cardinal stockholders honored Busch with the number 85 on his 85th birthday in [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|1984]].

==Radio and television coverage==
{{see also|List of St. Louis Cardinals broadcasters}}

===Radio===
Capable of reaching 21 million listeners in nine states including [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Tennessee]], the Cardinals radio network is the second-largest in MLB with 117 affiliate stations.&lt;ref name="Ratings among highest" /&gt;  In St. Louis, [[CBS]]-owned [[KMOX]] (1120 AM) airs Cardinals games over radio and feeds the rest of the Cardinals network.  [[Mike Shannon]] and [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers, with Chris Hrabe serving as [[pre-game show|pre-game]] and [[post-game show|post-game]] host.  KMOX's 50,000-[[watt]] [[clear-channel station|clear-channel signal]] covers much of the [[continental United States]] at night.  At one time, owing to the Cardinals' status as a "regional" franchise, the Cardinals radio network reached almost half of the country.

The 2011 season marked the Cardinals' return to KMOX following five seasons on [[KTRS (AM)|KTRS]] (550 AM), a station which is 50 percent owned by the Cardinals.  With a partnership spanning seven decades, and continuously since 1954, its conclusion was realized after the 2005 season when [[CBS Radio]] and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement.  However, frustrated by the underpowered coverage of 5,000-watt KTRS, the Cardinals reached a new deal with KMOX in 2011.

[[Mike Shannon]] announced 30 fewer games in 2013, compared to the 15 he took off in 2012, and in previous seasons.  Most of the games will be road games and three-city trips.  He has been announcing Cardinals' games starting in 1972, making 2013 his 41st year announcing.  He turns 74 in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/shannon-will-do-fewer-cards-games-in/article_87e1fd82-c8e3-56b5-ae97-6f9d53587a7f.html |title=Shannon will do fewer Cards games in 2013 |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has announced Cardinals' games for more years than anyone except [[Jack Buck]] (1954–58, 1961–2001) who announced for 46 years.

===Television===
Since 2000, Cardinals telecasts have generated the top three in ratings in MLB every season.&lt;ref name="Ratings among highest" /&gt;  [[Fox Sports Midwest]] airs all games in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] and is the team's exclusive television broadcaster, with the exception of selected [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Saturday afternoon games]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (via its St. Louis affiliate, [[KTVI]]) or ''[[Major League Baseball on ESPN|Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]].  [[Fox Sports Indiana]], [[Fox Sports South]], [[Fox Sports Tennessee]], [[Fox Sports Oklahoma]], [[Fox Sports Southwest]], and [[SportSouth]] air Cardinals games for fans living within the Cardinals broadcast territory who do not receive the Fox Sports Midwest channel. During the 2016 season, the Cardinals averaged a 8.54 rating and 104,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts in St Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2016/09/28/here-are-the-2016-mlb-prime-time-television-ratings-for-each-team/2/ Here Are The 2016 MLB Prime Time Television Ratings For Each Team] - Maury Brown, Forbes SportsMoney, 28 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The television commentators lineup includes [[Dan McLaughlin]], [[Rick Horton]], and [[Al Hrabosky]].  Jimmy "The Cat" Hayes serves as [[field reporter|dugout reporter]] during the game as well as on ''Cardinals Live'', a pre- and post-game show. ''Cardinals Live'' is hosted in-studio by Pat Parris along with game analysts and former Cardinals players [[Jim Edmonds]], [[Gary Bennett (baseball)|Gary Bennett]] and [[Chris Duncan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportsmidwest.com/mlb/st-louis-cardinals/story/Edmonds-joins-FOX-Sports-Midwest?blockID=878543|title=Edmonds joins Fox Sports Midwest|publisher=Fox Sports Midwest.com|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cardinals Kids'', a program aimed at the team's younger fans, airs weekly in-season on Fox Sports Midwest. It's hosted by former Cardinals pitcher [[Andy Benes]], team mascot [[Fredbird]], and Busch Stadium Public Address announcer John "The U-Man" Ulett. The 30-minute show began airing in 2003 and presents team news, player profiles, and Cardinals team history in a kid-friendly manner along with games and trivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cardinalskids.com/about-page|title=About Cardinals Kids|publisher=Cardinals Kids.com|year=2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weekly magazine program, ''This Week in Cardinal Nation'', airs on St. Louis' [[NBC]] affiliate [[KSDK]]. Cardinals games had been seen on KSDK (and its predecessor, KSD-TV) from 1947 through 1958, 1963 through 1987, and 2007 until 2010. [[KPLR-TV]] was the Cardinals' other over-the-air broadcaster, carrying games from 1959 through 1962 and from 1988 until 2006.

Former Cardinals broadcasters include [[Jack Buck]], [[Harry Caray]], [[Dizzy Dean]], [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.]], and [[Jay Randolph]]. [[Joe Buck]], the son of Jack Buck, was an official member of the Cardinals' broadcast team from 1991 until 2007. The younger Buck is currently the lead play-by-play caller for [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' national [[Fox Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball]] and [[Fox NFL|National Football League]] broadcasts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21445">'''Target costing''' is an approach to determine a product’s [[life-cycle cost]] which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired [[profit margin]] from a competitive market price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A target cost is the maximum amount of cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spreads the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting [[Product lifecycle|product life cycle]]. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of [[cost reduction]] determined by the target costing process.

== Definition ==
Target costing is defined as "a disciplined process for determining and achieving a full-stream cost at which a proposed product with specified functionality, performance, and quality must be produced in order to generate the desired profitability at the product’s anticipated selling price over a specified period of time in the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifton, Bird, Albano &amp; Townsend|title=Target Costing; Market-Driven Product Design|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-4611-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition encompasses the principal concepts: products should be based on an accurate assessment of the wants and needs of customers in different market segments, and cost targets should be what result after a sustainable profit margin is subtracted from what customers are willing to pay at the time of product introduction and afterwards.

The fundamental objective of target costing is to manage the business to be profitable in a highly competitive marketplace. In effect, target costing is a proactive cost planning, [[cost management]], and [[cost reduction]] practice whereby costs are planned and managed out of a product and business early in the design and development cycle, rather than during the later stages of product development and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|publisher=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Target costing was developed independently in both USA and Japan in different time periods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burrows, G., Chanhall, R.H.|title=Target costing: first and second comings|url=|journal=Accounting History Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |date=July 2012 |pages=127–142|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing was adopted earlier by American companies to reduce cost and improve productivity, such as [[Ford Motor]] from 1900s, American Motors from 1950s-1960s. Although the ideas of target costing were also applied by a number of other American companies including [[Boeing]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Northern Telecom]], few of them apply target costing as comprehensively and intensively as top Japanese companies such as [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]], [[Nippondenso]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=IMA – Institute of Management Accounts|date=1994|title=Implementing Target Costing|url=|publisher=The Society of Management Accounts of Canada|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing emerged from Japan from 1960s to early 1970s with the particular effort of Japanese automobile industry, including Toyota and Nissan. It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Monden, Yasuhiro  |author2=Kazuki Hamada |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1991|title=Target costing and kaizen costing in Japanese automobile companies|url=|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurai (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakurai, Michiharu|date=1989|title=Target costing and how to use it|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanaka (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka, Takao|date=1993|title=Target costing at Toyota|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cooper (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper, Robin|date=1992|title=Implementing activity based cost management|url=|publisher=The Institute of Management Accountants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the way that Japanese companies applied target costing to thrive in their business (IMA 1994). With superior implementation systems, Japanese manufacturers are more successful than the American companies in developing target costing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional [[cost-plus pricing]] strategy has been impeding the productivity and profitability for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gagne, M.L.  |author2=Discenza, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1995|title=Target costing|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=16–22|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hibbets, A.R., Albright, T., and Funk, W.|date=2005|title=The competitive environment and strategy of target costing implementers: evidence from the field|url=|journal=Journal of Managerial Issues |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=65–81|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a new strategy, target costing is replacing traditional cost-plus pricing strategy by maximizing [[customer satisfaction]] by accepted level of quality and functionality while minimizing costs.

== Process of target costing ==
The process of target costing can be divided into three sections: the first section involves in market-driven target costing, which focuses on studying market conditions to identify a product’s allowable cost in order to meet the company’s long-term profit at expected selling price; the second section involves performing cost reduction strategies with the product designer’s effort and creativity to identify the product-level target cost; the third section is component-level target cost which decomposes the production cost to functional and component levels to transmit cost responsibility to suppliers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Target costing process redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Target costing process&lt;/div&gt;]]

=== Market-driven target costing ===
Market driven target costing is the first section in the target costing process which focuses on studying market conditions and determining the company’s [[profit margin]] in order to identify the allowable cost of a product. Market driven costing can go through 5 steps including: establish company’s long-term sales and profit objective; develop the mix of products; identify target selling price for each product; identify profit margin for each product; and calculate allowable cost of each product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Company’s long-term sales and profit objectives are developed from an extensive analysis of relevant information relating to customers, market and products. Only realistic plans are accepted to proceed to the next step. [[Product lining|Product mix]] is designed carefully to ensure that it satisfies many customers, but also does not contain too many products to confuse customers. Company may use simulation to explore the impact of overall profit objective to different product mixes and determine the most feasible product mix. Target selling price, target profit margin and allowable cost are identified for each product. Target selling price need to consider to the expected market condition at the time launching the product. Internal factors such as product’s functionality and profit objective, and external factors such as company’s image or expected price of competitive products will influence target selling price. Company’s long-term profit plan and life-cycle cost are considered when determining target profit margin. Firms might set up target profit margin based on either actual profit margin of previous products or target profit margin of product line. Simulation for overall group profitability can help to make sure achieving group target. Subtracting target profit margin from target selling price results in allowable cost for each product. Allowable cost is the cost that can spend on the product to ensure meeting profit target if selling it at target price. It is the signal about the magnitude of cost saving that team need to achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Product-level target costing ===
Following the completion of market-driven costing, the next task of the target costing process is product-level target costing. Product-level target costing concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost. To achieve this goal, product-level target costing is typically divided into three steps as shown below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Product-level target costing redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Product-level target costing&lt;/div&gt;]]

The first step is to set a product-level target cost. Since the allowable cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable target cost that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this target cost process, including monitoring the relationship between the target cost and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total target costs at the component-level does not exceed the target cost of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the target cost was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as [[value engineering]] (VE), [[DFMA|design for manufacture and assembly]] (DFMA), and [[quality function deployment]] (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target costing and value engineering ==

[[Value engineering]] (VE), also known as value analysis (VA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=Lawrence|title=Techniques of Value Analysis Engineering|date=March 9, 2015|publisher=Lawrence D. Miles Value Foundation|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays a crucial role in the target costing process, particularly at the product level and the component level. Among the three aforementioned methods in achieving the target cost, VE is the most critical one because not only does it attempt to reduce costs, but also aims to improve the functionality and quality of products. There are a variety of practical VE strategies, including zero-look, first-look and second-look VE approaches, as well as [[Product teardown|teardown]] approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Target Costing and Value Engineering|last=Cooper &amp; Slagmulder|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Portland, OR, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the complexity of problems in the real world, implementing the target costing process often relies on the [[computer simulation]] to reproduce stochastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=Jurgen|title=Neural networks for cost estimation: Simulations and pilot application|journal=International Journal of Production Research|date=2000|volume=38|issue=6|pages=1231–1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many firms use simulation to study the complex relationship between selling prices and profit margins, the impact of individual product decisions on overall group profitability, the right mix of products to enhance overall profit, or other economic modeling to overcome organizational inertia by getting the most productive reasoning. In addition, simulation helps estimate results rapidly for dynamic process changes.

== Factors affecting target costing ==
The factors influencing the target costing process is broadly categorized based on how a company's strategy for a product's quality, functionality and price change over time. However, some factors play a specific role based on what drives a company's approach to target costing.

=== Factors influencing market-driven costing ===
Intensity of competition and nature of the customer affect market-driven costing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khandwalla|first1=Pradip|title=The Effect of Different Types of Competition on the Use of Management Controls|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|date=Autumn 1972|volume=10|issue=2|pages=275–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors introducing similar products has been shown to drive rival companies to expend energy on implementing target costing systems such as in the case of Toyota and Nissan or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]]. The costing process is also affected by the level of customer sophistication, changing requirements and the degree to which their future requirements are known. The [[automotive]] and [[camera]] industry are prime examples for how customers affect target costing based on their exact requirements.

=== Factors influencing product-level costing ===
[[Product strategy]] and product characteristics affect product-level target costing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Characteristics of product strategy such as number of products in line, rate of redesign operations and level of innovation are shown to have an effect. Higher number of products has a direct correlation with the benefits of target costing. Frequent redesigns lead to the introduction of new products that have created better benefits to target costing. It has to be noted that the value of historical information reduces with greater innovation, thereby, reducing the benefits of product level target costing.

The degree of complexity of the product, level of investments required and the duration of product development process make up the factors that affect the target costing process based on product characteristics. Product viability is determined by the aforementioned factors. In turn, the target costing process is also modified to suit the different degrees of complexity required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Factors influencing component-level costing ===
Supplier-Base strategy is the main factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to play a key role in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of [[horizontal integration]], power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the [[buying power]] of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of target costs particularly at a component level.

== Applications ==
Aside from the application of target costing in the field of manufacturing, target costing are also widely used in the following areas.

=== Energy ===
An Energy Retrofit Loan Analysis Model has been developed using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo (MC) method]] for target costing in [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficient]] buildings and construction. MC method has been shown to be effective in determining the impact of financial uncertainties in project performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~tommelein/papers/2012-Lee-PhD.pdf|title=Application of Target Value Design to Energy Efficiency Investments|last=Lee|first=Hyun Woo|date=Spring 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Target Value Design Decision Making Process (TVD-DMP) groups a set of energy efficiency methods at different optimization levels to evaluate costs and uncertainties involved in the energy efficiency process. Some major design parameters are specified using this methods including Facility Operation Schedule, Orientation, [[Plug load]], [[HVAC]] and [[lighting]] systems.

The entire process consists of three phases: initiation, definition and alignment. Initiation stage involves developing a business case for energy efficiency using target value design (TVD) training, organization and compensation. The definition process involves defining and validating the case by tools such as values analysis and bench marking processes to determine the allowable costs. By setting targets and designing the design process to align with those targets, TVD-DMP has been shown to achieve a high level of collaboration needed for energy efficiency investments. This is done by using [[risk analysis]] tools, pull planning and rapid estimating processes.

=== Healthcare ===
Target costing and target value design have applications in building healthcare facilities including critical components such as [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]s (NICUs). The process is influenced by unit locations, degree of comfort, number of patients per room, type of supply location and access to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybkowski, Shepley|date=Summer 2012|title=Target Value Design: Applications to Newborn Intensive Care Units|url=|journal=Health Environments Research &amp; Design Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Vital Statistics System|National Vital Statistics]] Reports, 12.18% of 2009 births were premature and the cost per infant was $51,600. This led to opportunities for NICUs to implement target value design for deciding whether to build a single-family room or more open-bay NICUs. This was achieved using set-based design analysis which challenges the designer to generate multiple alternatives for the same functionality. Designs are evaluated keeping in mind the requirements of the various stakeholders in the NICU including nurses, doctors, family members and administrators. Unlike linear point-based design, set-based design narrows options to the optimal one by eliminating alternatives simultaneously defined by user constraints.

=== Construction ===
About 15% construction project in Japan adopted target costing for their cost planning and management as recognized by Jacomit (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacomit, A.M, Granja. A.D., Picchi, F.A.|date=2008|title=Target costing research analysis: reflections for construction industry implementation|url=|journal=16th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction. Manchester, UK. 16–18 July|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., target costing research has been carried out within the framework of lean construction as target value design (TVD) method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballard, G.|date=2000|title=Lean Project Delivery System|url=|journal=Lean Construction Institute White Paper N8. Revision 1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been disseminated widely over construction industry in recent years. Research has proven that if being applied systematically, TVD can deliver a significant improvement in project performance with average reduction of 15% in comparison with market cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimina, D., Ballard, G., Pasquire, C.|date=2012|title=Target value design: using collaboration and a lean approach to reduce construction cost|url=|journal=Construction Management and Economics |volume=30 |pages=383–398|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TVD in construction project considers the final cost of project as a design parameter, similar to the capacity and aesthetics requirements for the project. TVD requires the project team to develop a target cost from the beginning. The project team is expected not to design exceeding the target cost without the owner’s approval, and must use different skills to maintain this target cost. In some cases, the cost can increase but the project team must commit to decrease and must try their best to decrease without impacting on other functions of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan, J., Coci, L.|date=2012|title=Recommended Practices for the Application of Lean Construction Methods to Building New Australian LNG Capacity|url=|journal=Engineers Australia.

A '''tax advisor''' or '''tax consultant''' is a person with advanced training and knowledge of [[tax law]]. The services of a tax advisor are usually retained in order to minimize taxation while remaining compliant with the law in complicated financial situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxadvisor.asp|title=Tax Advisor Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax Advisors are also retained to represent clients before tax authorities and tax courts to resolve tax issues.

==World==
===Austria===
In [[Austria]], Steuerberater is the professional license for tax advisors.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], tax advisors are called ''commercialisti'', and provide assistance on [[business management]], [[business law]], [[economics]], [[finance]], tax, [[accounting]], commercial, corporate and administrative matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/regprof/index.cfm?action=regprof&amp;id_regprof=18165&amp;cookies=disabled|title=Dottore commercialista (Italy)|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treccani, [http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/commercialista/ commercialista]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dottori commercialisti'', who have a degree in [[economics]], and ''ragionieri commercialisti'', who have a [[diploma]] from an ''[[istituto tecnico economico]]'', were members of two different [[Professional Order|professional orders]], but they were merged in 2008 and it is now impossible to become a ''commercialista'' without a ''[[Laurea#Second cycle: Laurea Magistrale|laurea magistrale]]''. ''Esperti contabili'', whose roles are similar to those of a ''commercialista'', must have a ''[[Laurea#First cycle: Laurea|laurea]]'', a first cycle degree that is equivalent to a [[bachelor's degree]]. According to the Italian law, the following activities are some of the roles of a ''commercialista'':
* the administration and liquidation of companies and assets;
* surveys and technical advice;
* inspections and administrative reviews;
* verifications and investigations regarding the reliability of [[financial statements]], [[financial accounts|accounts]] and records of a [[company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoroeformazione.it/1/lavoro/il-dottore-commercialista-,138|title=Il dottore commercialista|publisher=lavoroeformazione.it|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unive.it/pag/10159/|title=Dottore commercialista, Esperto contabile, Revisore legale|publisher=[[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]]|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elenco-commercialisti.it/dottore-commercialista.html|title=Dottore commercialista e ragioniere commercialista|publisher=ItaliaWeb Srl|language=Italian||access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called {{nihongo|'''certified public tax accountant'''|税理士|zeirishi}}. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special state examination, or already be qualified as an [[attorney at law (Japan)|attorney at law]] or [[certified public accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp/eng/index.html Japan Federation of Certified Public Tax Accountants' Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called '''certified tax accountant'''. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special examination.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], guidelines concerning professional conduct in relation to taxation are published in conjunction with the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation]], the [[Association of Taxation Technicians]], the [[Institute of Indirect Taxation]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]. These were prepared for the assistance of members of the various associations both generally in dealing with clients and the tax authorities and specifically in relation to irregularities and errors. 

The guidelines, which include practical advice about a range of legal and ethical issues, are summarised as:

* A member's primary duty is to ensure that his actions comply with the law. He/she owes a contractual duty to the client to act for him/her with the requisite degree of skill and care, and the contractual relationship should be governed by a letter of engagement. The member also has duties to the tax authorities, notably of compliance with the law and the honest presentation of his client's circumstances.
* It is the taxpayer's responsibility to ensure that returns made to the tax authorities are correct and complete. It is for the member to assist him to decide on the extent and manner of disclosure of facts in relation to his tax affairs.
*Where a member becomes aware that irregularities have occurred in relation to a client's tax affairs he should advise the client of the consequences, and the manner of disclosure. If necessary, appropriate specialist advice should be taken.
* Where a client refuses to follow the advice of a member in relation to issues involving disclosure, the member should consider whether he should continue to act. If appropriate, specialist advice should be taken.
* If mistakes are made by the tax authorities there may be a need, and in some cases a duty, on the part of the client and sometimes the member, to put matters right.
* Members may have statutory duties of disclosure where they have suspicions of criminal activity.
* When approached for information on a client's affairs by another adviser the member should ensure that he has his client's authority before making any disclosure.

===United States===
In the United States, paid tax return preparers are regulated but not licensed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. There are penalties for failure to disclose the identity of the preparer on the return, for the failure to give the taxpayer a copy of the return, and for negligence in preparing the return.

Practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by [[Circular 230|''Treasury Department Circular No. 230'']], ''Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Most practice is limited to [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), [[enrolled agent]]s, and [[enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]]. Rendering tax advice is also regulated by [[Circular 230]].

Failure to uphold these standards can result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to permanent disbarrment from practice.

In the United States, the term "tax professional" is a generic term describing a variety of professions including enrolled agents, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), [[financial planner]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[tax preparer]]s, and some [[lawyer]]s.

In the United States, by far the largest segment of tax professionals are individual tax preparers.

'''''Too Big to Fail''''' is an American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[television film]] first broadcast on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] on May 23, 2011 based on [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System—and Themselves]]'' (2009). The film was directed by [[Curtis Hanson]]. It received 11 nominations at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards#Most nominated shows|63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]; [[Paul Giamatti]]'s portrayal of [[Ben Bernanke]] earned him the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] at the [[18th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

==Plot summary==
''Too Big to Fail'' chronicles the [[Late-2000s financial crisis#Credit markets and the shadow banking system|2008 financial meltdown]], focusing on the actions of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Paulson]] ([[William Hurt]]) and [[Ben Bernanke]] ([[Paul Giamatti]]), Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]], to contain the problems during the period of August 2008 to October 13, 2008. The film starts with clips of news reports about the mortgage industry crisis and the forced sale of the troubled [[Bear Stearns]] to [[JPMorgan Chase]], with Fed guarantees.

With Bear Stearns out of the picture, [[Short (finance)|short sellers]] have turned their attention on [[Lehman Brothers]]. In need of capital, CEO [[Dick Fuld]] ([[James Woods]]) reluctantly fires COO Joe Gregory and CFO Erin Callan, naming Bart McDade as the new President and COO. McDade negotiates a deal with Korean investors, but the deal falls through when Fuld interrupts the negotiations and tries to convince the Koreans that they are undervaluing the [[Toxic asset|toxic]] real estate assets.

Paulson is adamant that the government will not subsidize any more acquisitions, but it becomes clear the most promising buyer for Lehman, [[Bank of America]], is uninterested without Fed involvement. Paulson and [[President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]] ([[Billy Crudup]]) gather the leaders of the biggest banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] CEO [[Lloyd Blankfein]] ([[Evan Handler]]), [[JPMorgan Chase]] CEO [[Jamie Dimon]] ([[Bill Pullman]]), and [[Morgan Stanley]] CEO [[John J. Mack|John Mack]] ([[Tony Shaloub]]), to convince them to underwrite the deal themselves. During a break in negotiations, another threatened firm, [[Merrill Lynch]], approaches Bank of America to buy them instead, which Paulson tacitly okays. With Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch, the only other buyer is British firm [[Barclays]], but their involvement is blocked by [[Financial Services Authority|British banking regulators]]. Lehman collapses and is forced into [[bankruptcy]]. Meanwhile, insurance firm [[AIG]] also begins to fail.

Lehman's collapse affects the entire financial market, and the stock market goes into freefall. Blankfein, Mack, and [[General Electric]] CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] inform Paulson they are unable to do business, and [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|French Finance Minister]] [[Christine Lagarde]] warns him that he must not allow AIG to fail. Unlike Lehman, the Treasury rescues AIG with an $85 billion loan.

Bernanke argues that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. With the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] drying up, Paulson's plan is to buy the toxic assets from the banks to take the risk off their books and increase their cash reserves. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing the potential of fallout worse than the [[Great Depression]] if they fail to act. Paulson threatens [[U.S. Senator]] and Presidential candidate [[John McCain]] not to interfere and begs [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] not to back away from the negotiations. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]], the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|legislation passes]] on a second attempt and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) is created.

Paulson's team realizes that buying toxic assets will take too long, leaving direct capital injects into the banks as their only option to use TARP get credit flowing again. Along with [[FDIC]] Chair [[Sheila Bair]], Paulson informs the banks that they will receive mandatory capital injections. The banks eventually agree, but Paulson's staff laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms of how they should use the billions with which they are being bailed out. An epilogue notes that bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, and that now only ten financial institutions hold 77% of all U.S. banking assets and have been declared [[too big to fail]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">The '''Tripoli Entrepreneurs Club''' was launched in November 2013 in [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/tripolieclub/info?tab=page_info&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a grass roots initiative aimed at inspiring and supporting local youth to think critically about how to start a business through workshops and Young Entrepreneur Boot Camps&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj2NS7WhoLQ&lt;/ref&gt; among other events.

The idea started as a response to an urgent need in the community: finding a solution for the lack of job opportunities and high unemployment rates. One of the main objectives of this club is to enable youth to create businesses which can generate jobs and economic growth in the near future.

The broad mission of TEC is to strengthen the social and economic backbone of [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] through providing aspiring entrepreneurs and youth with strong mentorship and the infrastructure needed to grow new companies.

The organisation has been featured on TV&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyCz6t0i31M#t=2940 "Nharkom Said - December 5, 2014"], ''[[Nharkom Said]]'', Beirut, Lebanon, 5 December 2014. Retrieved on 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and received positive mention from [[British Ambassador to Lebanon, Tom Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;Farhat, Reine [http://www.wamda.com/2014/12/tripoli-entrepreneurs-giving-back-to-their-communities?ref=fb "Lebanese entrepreneurs work to grow new talent in Tripoli - December 21, 2014"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Cartridge Company''' was an early manufacturer of cartridge [[ammunition]] for [[small arms]]. The company was founded in 1869 by [[American Civil War]] general [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]]. Company startup was during the most rapid evolution of cartridge design to date.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis ''Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology, number 11, Small Arms Ammunition'' Smithsonian Institution Press (1972) p.8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] emerged as one of the most successful cartridge producers in the United States while Butler served as a [[congressman]] from [[Massachusetts]] from 1867 to 1879 and as [[governor]] from 1883 to 1884. After supplying 65 percent of American small arms ammunition production for [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayres |first=Leonard P. |authorlink = |title =The War with Germany |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition =Second |date =1919 |location =Washington, DC |page =69 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company was acquired by the owner of [[Winchester Repeating Arms]]; and the Lowell factory closed as manufacturing shifted to [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowelllandtrust.org/greenwayclassroom/history/USCartridgeCompany.pdf|title=U.S. Cartridge Company|publisher=Lowell Land Trust|accessdate=2013-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426182220/http://lowelllandtrust.org/greenwayclassroom/history/USCartridgeCompany.pdf|archive-date=2013-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Butler family==
Benjamin Butler, a lawyer who grew up on Lowell, became a major shareholder of Middlesex Mills in the 1850s; because of his successful law practice he was one of Lowell's wealthiest residents at the end of the Civil War. With other local capitalists, he formed the [[Wamesit Canal-Whipple Mill Industrial Complex|Wamesit Power Company]], the United States Bunting Company, and the United States Cartridge Company.  Patent attorney Joe V. Meigs invented an improved [[Cartridge (firearms)|metallic cartridge]] for the company; and oversaw production beginning in 1869.  Meigs was replaced in the mid-1870s by Charles Dimon, who had been an officer under Butler's command during the Civil War. By the early 1880s, the company employed 250 workers producing cartridges, paper-shot-shells, and primers. Paul Butler assumed control of the company when his father died in 1893. Benjamin Butler's grandson, [[Butler Ames]], replaced Charles Dimon in 1902.&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;

==Boom years==
A 29 July 1903 powder magazine explosion in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]] destroyed or damaged seventy homes killing 22 employees and residents and injuring 70 more. New brick magazines and factories replaced early wooden structures prior to World War I.&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;

The company employed 1,200 when British purchasing agents arrived in September 1914 to request expanded production. Lowell's Bigelow carpet factory was converted to ammunition production, and a new ammunition factory was built in South Lowell. As employment swelled to 15,000, a [[labor strike]] in the autumn of 1915 was resolved within a month to sustain ammunition production. A total of 2,262,671,000 military cartridges were manufactured for the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/merchants/merchant_13.html|title=Merchants of Death|publisher=Engelbrech &amp; Hanighen|accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New owners and locations==
[[National Lead Company]] purchased a controlling stock interest after Paul Butler died in 1918. Cartridge manufacturing machinery was moved from Lowell to New Haven in 1926 where manufacturing continued under the Winchester name after the Lowell plants closed on 1 January 1927.&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;

Winchester was purchased by [[Olin Corporation]] on 22 December 1931. Olin used their subsidiary United States Cartridge Company to build and operate the Saint Louis Ordnance Plant manufacturing military small arms ammunition in [[St. Louis]] through [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoishistory.gov/Illinois%20History/306Francis.pdf|title=Olin Brass: A Blast from the Past|publisher=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born and growing up in [[Enschede]], Draijer wanted to be a [[reporter]], but an uncle advised him to complete a professional study before trying his hand at [[journalism]].&lt;ref name="Draijer-Profiel-VNONCW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vno-ncw.nl/publicaties/Forum/Pages/Profiel_Wiebe_Draijer_de_nieuwe_voorzitter_van_de_SociaalEconomische_Raad_17415.aspx |title=Profiel: Wiebe Draijer, de nieuwe voorzitter van de Sociaal-Economische Raad |publisher=[[VNO-NCW]] |accessdate=19 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this advise Draijer studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]] from 1983 to 1989. During his time as a student he also worked as a [[freelance]] reporter for [[NRC Handelsblad]].

'''William Hemsley Emory''' (September 7, 1811 – December 1, 1887) was a prominent [[United States|American]] [[surveying|surveyor]] and [[civil engineer]] in the 19th century. As an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers he specialized in mapping the United States border, including the Texas–Mexico border, and the Gadsden Purchase border, 1844–1855, and published lasting scientific reports on the border region.

==Early life and early career==
Emory was born in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]], on his family's "Poplar Grove" estate. He attended the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], and graduated in 1831. Assigned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], he served in the Fourth Artillery until he resigned from the service in 1836 to pursue [[civil engineering]], but he returned to the service in 1838 as lieutenant in the newly formed Corps of Topographical Engineers.

William H. Emory was most importantly a topographical engineer and explorer. From 1839 to 1842, he surveyed harbors and the Delaware River. In 1844, Emory served in an expedition that produced a new map of Texan claims westward to the Rio Grande, which brought him national attention as the war with Mexico seemed eminent. He next conducted a boundary survey of the [[Canada–United States border]] (1844–1846). His mapmaking skills were so superb and detailed with such great accuracy that he often made other maps obsolete; thus making him the authority of the trans-Mississippi west.

==Mexican–American War and Gadsden Purchase==
At the start of the Mexican War, Emory was selected to join General [[Stephen Watts Kearny]] and the [[Army of the West (1846)]] to take [[New Mexico]] and [[California]]. Along the way he kept a detailed journal of the march down the Rio Grande and across to the [[Gila River]], and down it to its mouth on the [[Colorado River]], then to the Pacific Coast. Published by the Thirtieth United States Congress in 1848 as ''Notes of a Military Reconnaissance from Fort Leavenworth to San Diego,'' it became an important guide book for the road to Southern California. This report described terrain and rivers, cities and forts and made observations about Native Americans, Mexicans, primarily in future New Mexico Territory, [[Arizona]] Territory and Southern California. It was and is considered one of the important chronicles and descriptions of the historic Southwest, particularly noted for its maps. Emory was a reliable and conscientious cartographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spence |first1=Mary Lee |title=The Expeditions of John Charles Fremont, vol 3, Travels from 1848 to 1854 |date=1984 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=0-252-00416-7 |pages=495-496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Emory was sent with a crew to survey the new United States-Mexico boundary, first from the mouth of the Gila across California to the coast and then 2d, with the Bartlett survey from El Paso west, 1849–1853. A dispute arose among the Mexicans and Americans over the location of the starting line near El Paso caused by an error in the original map referred to in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848). A compromise by John Bartlett brought an international incident when neither side agreed to the boundary and threatened renewed hostilities in the [[Mesilla Valley]] above El Paso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiser |first1=William |title=Turmoil on the Rio Grande, the Territorial History of the Mesilla Valley, 1846-1865 |date=2011 |publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-60344-296-1 |pages=50-69}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was reached with the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1854, and Emory was selected to lead the American boundary commission to survey, 1855–1856, the new boundary line (earlier he had influenced the debate over approving the treaty by advising Senator [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] of Texas on the best route for a southern transcontinental railroad, one of the key points of the Gadsden Treaty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norris |first1=L David |title=William H. Emory, Soldier-Scientist |date=1998 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=0-8165-1911-0 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a story of testament as to Emory's dedication to accuracy that says John Bartlett his supervisor in the boundary survey made him sign off on a misplaced boundary marker, creating a sweet revenge for Emory who replaced him as Head of the International Boundary Commission in 1855. But William H. Emory did more than just map the terrain; he also made notes about the plant life as well as the people who inhabited the sparsely populated Southwest. Notating the social relations of some of the Native American people, he wrote: "Women, when captured, are taken as wives by those who capture them, but they are treated by the Indian wives of the capturers as slaves, and made to carry wood and water; if they chance to be pretty, or receive too much attention from their lords and masters, they are, in the absence of the latter, unmercifully beaten and otherwise maltreated. The most unfortunate thing which can befall a captive woman is to be claimed by two persons. In this case, she is either shot or delivered up for indiscriminate violence."[2] His multi-volume boundary survey published as the ''Report of the United States and Mexican Boundary Commission, Made Under the Direction of the Secretary of the Interior'', 2 vols (Washington, GPO, 1857–1859, reprint Austin:Texas Historical Association, 1987) was not only a contribution to understanding the geography of the region but as a long-standing scientific contribution to the natural history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norris |first1=L. David |title=William H. Emory, Soldier-Scientist |date=1998 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=0-8165-1911-0 |pages=passim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
In 1861, when the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Emory was stationed in the [[Indian Territory]]. Anticipating the possible capture of his troops by [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], he secured the services of [[Black Beaver]], a famous Lenape warrior, to guide Emory's troops to safety. He promised that the government would compensate Black Beaver for the loss of his ranch. Emory withdrew Union troops from [[Fort Washita]] to [[Fort Leavenworth]]. During the withdrawal, Black Beaver also scouted pursuing enemy troops, and Emory attacked and captured lead elements of his pursuers, the first prisoners captured during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans, written and compiled by William E. Connelley, transcribed by Carolyn Ward, 1998. http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1918ks/v1/ch10p8.html accessed 12 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emory served as a [[brigadier|brigade commander]] in the [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1862, and was transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]].   He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on March 17, 1862.  He later commanded a [[Division (military)|division]] in the [[Battle of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] campaign. He subsequently returned to the East as the commander of the [[XIX Corps (ACW)|Nineteenth Corps]], serving in all the major battles in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864]], especially at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]], where Emory's actions helped save the Union army from a devastating defeat until Maj. Gen. [[Philip H. Sheridan|Philip Sheridan's]] arrival.

At the end of the war, Emory held the rank of colonel in the [[Regular Army]] and a brevet (honorary promotion) as major general.  He was promoted to major general in the volunteers on September 25, 1865 and was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866.

===Postbellum===
After the war, Emory held a number of posts, most importantly commander of the [[Department of the Gulf]] (which included the Federal troops in [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Mississippi]])–a demanding and dangerous [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] assignment. In September 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered Emory to [[New Orleans]], where he successfully negotiated a peace with the conservative [[White League]] who had taken over the city by military force. As a result, Republican Governor Kellogg was restored to power and the White League disbanded. For political reasons, General Sheridan removed Emory from command and saw to it that he was retired in 1876. The Department of the Gulf was soon shifted to Sheridan's large [[Military Division of the Missouri#Division of the Missouri|Division of the Missouri]], which included Texas.
