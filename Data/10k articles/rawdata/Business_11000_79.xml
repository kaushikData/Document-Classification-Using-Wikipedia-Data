'''200 Public Square''' (also known as the '''Sohio Building''', '''Standard Oil building''', the '''BP America Building''', '''BP America Tower''', '''BP Tower''', or '''BP Building''') is the third-tallest [[skyscraper]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  The building, located on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] in [[Downtown Cleveland]] reaches 45 stories and 658&amp;nbsp;ft (201 m) and holds 1.2 million square feet (111,000 m²) of office space. The building is Cleveland's regional headquarters for [[Huntington Bancshares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stan |last=Bullard |title=Huntington moving to 200 Public Square |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20081117/FREE/311179989 |work=[[Crain's Cleveland Business]] |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sohio==
In November 1981, [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] (Sohio) announced plans to build a skyscraper on Public Square.  Initially, it was supposed to surpass the [[Terminal Tower]] in height, but city officials insisted that the Tower remain the city's tallest building.  The BP Building was designed by [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] in the [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] style and angled to be parallel to both [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid]] and Superior avenues.

Construction began in 1982 with the [[Building implosion|demolition]] of two Cleveland landmarks, the [[Burnham and Root]] [[Cuyahoga Building]] ([[1892 in architecture|1892]]) and the 16-story [[George B. Post]] [[Williamson Building]] ([[1900 in architecture|1900]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Livingston |title=Remembering the Public Square implosion |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/remembering-the-public-square-implosion |work=[[WEWS-TV]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007144545/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/remembering-the-public-square-implosion |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new structure was completed in [[1985 in architecture|1985]] and was officially opened in 1987 as the [[BP]] America Tower, when British Petroleum purchased the remaining 45% of Sohio and merged its North American holdings to form BP America, Inc., headquartered in the new building.

==BP America, Inc.==
[[Claes Oldenburg]]'s ''[[Free Stamp]]'' sculpture was commissioned by [[Alton Whitehouse]] and other Sohio executives to stand in front of the tower, but BP officials did not appreciate it, and donated the sculpture to the City of Cleveland. After some modifications, the city installed it in [[Willard Park (Cleveland park)|Willard Park]], next to Cleveland City Hall.

Before the [[Key Tower]] was built, the BP Building was the second-most prominent skyscraper in the city, often photographed with the adjacent Terminal Tower as a twin emblem of Cleveland.  It contains 36 elevators, 10 escalators, 3 fountains, 1 waterfall, 1,500 plants, and several works of art.

[[File:200 Public Square atrium.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the building's [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] from the [[observation deck]] of the [[Terminal Tower]] ]]
When BP purchased [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based [[Amoco]] in 1998, the company said it would move its headquarters from Cleveland to Chicago.  The building was purchased by the Chicago-based [[Equity Office Properties Trust]] in 1996 for $144 million, which in turn sold it to [[Harbor Group International]] in June 2005 for $141.25 million.  Harbor Group worked with Electra Real Estate (TASE: ELTR) to purchase the building.  The building was subsequently renamed 200 Public Square. Most Clevelanders and the Harbor Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harborgroupmanagement.com/Properties/Ohio/200_Public_Square/200_public_square.html The Harbor Group: 200 Public Square] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813174922/http://www.harborgroupmanagement.com/Properties/Ohio/200_Public_Square/200_public_square.html |date=2007-08-13 }}. Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; still recognize it as the BP Tower, although many still refer to it as the Sohio Building.

==Huntington Bank==
In June 2011, [[Huntington Bank]] placed its corporate logo at the top of the building. The bank moved its regional headquarters to the tower from the [[Huntington Bank Building]] that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Olivera |last=Perkins |title=New sign on Public Square: Huntington Bank regional headquarters |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/06/new_sign_on_public_square_hunt.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbor Group International put the building up for sale in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Jarboe McFee |title=200 Public Square skyscraper for sale in downtown Cleveland |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/06/200_public_square_skyscraper_f.html |work=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In FY 2010, AMS and ATS contributed almost equally to net sales.  The majority of sales, particularly for AMS, are in the space, avionics, and defense markets.

In May 2014, Aeroflex was acquired by the UK aerospace company '''[[Cobham plc|Cobham]]''' for $1.46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/cobham-acquires-wireless-communications-company-for-1-46-billion/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=Cobham Acquires Wireless Communications Company for $1.46 Billion|date=20 May 2014|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aeroflex Colorado Springs==
[[Image:AeroflexCOS.jpg|right]]
Aeroflex Colorado Springs was a division which manufactured [[integrated circuit]]s for the aerospace, defense, medical, industrial, and security markets. It was located in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]]. Aeroflex  mixed-signal [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s and standard products containing data acquisition, communication, and processing circuits are supplied for uses such as medical imaging, safety-critical industrial, [[point-of-sale]], and secure data processing systems.  Circuit card assembly was also available.

== Legal Actions ==
In 2013, the [[US State Department]] settled with Aeroflex Incorporated over alleged violations of the [[Arms Export Control Act]]  ("AECA")(22 U.S.C. § 2778) and the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] ("ITAR")(22 C.F.R. parts 120-130).  The settlement was reached relative to ITAR Section 128.11 wherein Aeroflex entered into a consent agreement with the State Department.  Based on this settlement, Aeroflex paid a civil penalty of $4 million, and the State Department waived an additional $4 million penalty  on the “condition the Department approves expenditures for self-initiated, pre-Consent Agreement remedial compliance measures and Consent Agreement-authorized remedial compliance costs.” Aeroflex voluntarily disclosed most of the ITAR violations resolved in this settlement, “acknowledged their serious nature, cooperated with Department reviews, and since 2008 has implemented or has planned extensive remedial measures, including the restructuring of its compliance organization, the institution of a new testing protocol of its commodities, and a revised company-wide ITAR compliance program,” according to the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;US State Department Press Release, “State Department Concludes Settlement of Export Violations by Aeroflex Incorporated,” Aug 9, 2013, http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/08/213002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Reuters]] special report, while the State Department’s investigation was underway, Aeroflex exported more than 7,000 high-tech rad-chips to China, between 2003 and 2008, after US officials had directed the company to stop the exports.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, “How China's weapon snatchers are penetrating U.S. defenses,” Dec. 17, 2013, https://www.reuters.com/investigates/china-military/#article/part3&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA is based in [[McLean, Virginia]] and was founded in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ambulance.org/our-mission/ |title=American Ambulance Association: Our Mission |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA's website states that its mission is "to promote health care policies that ensure excellence in the ambulance services industry and provide research, education and communications programs to enable its members to effectively address the needs of the communities they serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ambulance.org/our-mission/ |title=American Ambulance Association: Our Mission |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this mission, the AAA manages the "Stars of Life" program, an annual awards program that recognizes "ambulance professionals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to their communities or the EMS profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stars.ambulance.org/ |title=Stars of Life 2018: American Ambulance Association |last=American Ambulance Association |first= |date= |website=ambulance.org |publisher=American Ambulance Association |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the AAA issued its first recommendations for diversity and intercultural communication, noting that the primarily white, male, English-speaking EMS workforce underserved some population sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/nyregion/a-brooklyn-ambulance-service-speaks-chinese-like-its-patients.html |title=A Brooklyn Ambulance Service Speaks Chinese, Like Its Patients |last=Nir |first=Sarah Maslin |date=May 23, 2016 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=In New York and around the country, emergency responders have historically been white and male, said Scott Moore, a human resources and operations consultant with the American Ambulance Association, a national trade organization, and an emergency medical technician for 26 years. Beyond translating words, Mr. Moore said, a diverse emergency response fleet can add cultural competency to how their work is done … Last year, Mr. Moore’s organization issued its first handbook for intercultural communication. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA holds an annual conference and awards dinner, where it gives annual awards such as the Patient and Employee Safety award to ambulance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scottsdaleindependent.com/news/scottsdale-ambulance-technology-receives-national-ems-safety-award/|title=Scottsdale ambulance technology receives national EMS safety award|date=2018-08-28|work=Scottsdale Independent|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another award is the Star of Life award. In March 2017, an ambulance was hit by a Jeep Cherokee in Mississippi, nearly killing a paramedic. Paramedic Jimmy Miller was awarded the AAA Star of Life award for outstanding service after surviving the wreck, which should have killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2018/08/08/wreck-nearly-kills-paramedic-who-earns-national-award-valor/872018002/|title=AMR paramedic survives near-fatal wreck, receives national award for valor|work=The Clarion Ledger|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">The '''Association of Plumbing and Heating Contractors''' (APHC) is a [[trade association]] for the [[plumbing]] and heating industry in [[England]] and [[Wales]], representing around 1500 businesses employing some 60,000 specialist engineers ranging from those employed by large companies to sole traders working in domestic properties.

The APHC represents these specialists on the [[Specialist Engineering Contractors Group]], a member of the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]].

==History==
The APHC started in 1925 as the National Federation of Plumbers and Domestic Engineers, focused on industrial and commercial aspects of plumbing that had previously been managed by the Institute of Plumbers (today the [[Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering|CIPHE]]), which remained focused on education, training and technical matters.

It became the National Federation of Plumbers and Domestic Heating Engineers in 1965 to reflect the increased amount of members' work on heating systems. In 1972 it became an association: the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Mechanical Services Contractors. It adopted its current name in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">{{Banking |image=London.bankofengland.arp.jpg |caption=The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.}}A '''banker's lien''' is a legal right arise in many [[common law jurisdictions]] of a [[bank]] to exercise a [[lien]] over any property in the custody of the bank as security for the indebtedness of the customer to the bank.&lt;ref name=Ellinger&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P.

==Scope==
The precise effect of a banker's lien varies according to the laws of a particular jurisdiction.  Under English common law it applies to all property coming into the possession of the bank in the usual course of banking business,&lt;ref&gt;''Brandao v Barnett'' (1846) 12 Cl 7 F 787&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the important exception that it does not apply to property which is deposited with the bank for safe custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Leese v Martin'' (1873) LR 17 Eq 224 at 235.  The bank holds such property as [[bailment|bailee]], and may be entitled to exercise a separate lien as such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most common law liens normally only give the lienee a passive right to retain the property, unusually, the banker's lien permits the bank the sell the relevant property.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberg v International Banking Corporation'' (1923) 14 Ll LR 344 at 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The lien does not generally extend to intangible rights, including credit balances on accounts.  However those credit balances may be subject to the [[banker's right to combine accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

The banker's lien may be modified or abrogated by agreement.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">A '''budget process''' refers to the process by which governments create and approve a [[budget]], which is as follows:

* The Financial Service Department prepares worksheets to assist the department head in preparation of department budget estimates
* The Administrator calls a meeting of managers and they present and discuss plans for the following year’s projected level of activity.
* The managers can work with the Financial Services, or work alone to prepare an estimate for the departments coming year.
* The completed budgets are presented by the managers to their Executive Officers for review and approval. 
* Justification of the budget request may be required in writing.  In most cases, the manager talks with their administrative officers about budget requirements.  Adjustments to the budget submission may be required as a result of this phase in the process.

Budgeting is the setting of expenditure levels for each of an organization’s functions. It is the estimation and allocation of available capital used to achieve the designated targets of a firm.

== Terminology ==
* '''Revenue Estimation''' performed in the executive branch by the finance director, clerk's office, budget director, manager, or a team.
* '''Budget Call''' issued to outline the presentation form, recommend certain goals.
* '''Budget Formulation''' reflecting on the past, set goals for the future and reconcile the difference.
* '''Budget Hearings''' can include departments, sections, the executive, and the public to discuss changes in the budget.
* '''Budget Adoption''' final approval by the legislative body.
* '''Budget Execution''' amending the budget as the fiscal year progresses.

== Constitutional economics ==

[[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]] which in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is completely controlled by the executive.  It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.  The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit.  The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Lee was born in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. She is a third generation [[Malaysian Chinese]]. Describing her own personality, she stated that she rarely cried as a child.&lt;ref name="Sina20041108"&gt;{{citation|url=http://eladies.sina.com.cn/2004-11-08/121393.html|periodical=Sina News|date=8 November 2004|title=冠军女孩李诗琪的美丽心情|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did her education at [[SMK Segambut Jaya]] ([[:ms:Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Segambut Jaya|see Malaysian Wikipedia]]) in [[Segambut]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and represented the [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] in [[Team handball|handball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/1/31/features/10002495&amp;sec=features |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019145451/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F1%2F31%2Ffeatures%2F10002495&amp;sec=features |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2012 |periodical=The Star |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |title=Carrie Lee is out of this world |last=Tham |first=Ai-Mei |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her school days, she was known as a tomboy, an image which she later chose to shed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/10/17/nation/9156861&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404202156/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2004%2F10%2F17%2Fnation%2F9156861&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2005 |periodical=The Star |date=17 October 2004 |accessdate=27 September 2011 |title=Former 'Tomboy' to represent Malaysia at pageant in Hong Kong |last=Ng |first=Cheng-Yee |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She represented Malaysia in [[Miss Tourism International]] 2003 and placed Top 15. In 2004, Lee represented Malaysia in the Miss Chinese Cosmos beauty pageant. During the proceedings, she spoke Chinese rather stammeringly, which observers suggested could be a barrier to her carrying out her duties as title-holder; nevertheless, she went on to win the top prize.&lt;ref name="Sina20041108"/&gt; In media interviews following her victory, she stated that she hoped to become an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ent.enorth.com.cn/system/2004/12/04/000917682.shtml|date=4 December 2004|accessdate=27 September 2011|title=中华小姐冠军亮相 李诗琪我适合演戏|periodical=Tianjin North News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she entered [[Jinan University]]'s Chinese Department as a short-term student to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Her oral skills showed significant improvement compared to the Miss Chinese Cosmos proceedings, but she was still not able to read or [[written Chinese|write Chinese]] aside from her own name. She hoped that studying at Jinan University would help her to become literate in Chinese and appreciate [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://edu.sina.com.cn/y/i/2005-09-01/102542731.html|date=1 September 2005|periodical=Sina News|title=中华小姐李诗琪求学暨大 第一天上课学写拍马屁|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Malaysia in 2005.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne20110712"&gt;{{citation |url=http://business.asiaone.com/Business/My%2BMoney/Property/Story/A1Story20110712-288766.html |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |title=Carried away by Miss Lee |last=Wilson |first=Willy |periodical=The Star |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902052019/http://business.asiaone.com/Business/My%2BMoney/Property/Story/A1Story20110712-288766.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, she had appeared in two Chinese-language television series in Malaysia, and worked as a promotional model for [[Pepsi]], [[Matsushita]], and [[Sony]].&lt;ref name="Phoenix"&gt;{{citation|url=http://phtv.ifeng.com/program/lyyy/xxz/200709/0910_1619_242294_1.shtml|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2011|title=最无悬念的选美理由：李诗琪，目标星光大道|periodical=[[Phoenix Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later went into business, purchasing the Miss Chinese Cosmos franchise for Malaysia, and founding White Fairy Sdn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Covered interest arbitrage''' is an [[arbitrage]] trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the [[interest rate]] differential between two countries by using a [[forward contract]] to ''cover'' (eliminate exposure to) [[foreign exchange risk|exchange rate risk]].&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 978-0-324-36563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or [[bank]]s to make use of the [[forward contract#Forward premium or discount|forward premium]] (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates.&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Pilbeam, Keith | year = 2006 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-4837-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the [[interest rate parity]] condition does not constantly hold. When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever [[currency]] offers a higher [[rate of return]].&lt;ref name="Moffett et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Fundamentals of Multinational Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Moffett, Michael H. | author2 = Stonehill, Arthur I. | author3 = Eiteman, David K. | year = 2009 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 978-0-321-54164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered interest arbitrage opportunities, such as differing characteristics of [[asset]]s, varying frequencies of [[time series]] data, and the [[transaction cost]]s associated with arbitrage trading strategies.

==Mechanics of covered interest arbitrage==
[[File:Covered-interest-arbitrage.svg|thumb|right|375px|A visual representation of a simplified covered interest arbitrage scenario, ignoring compounding interest. In this numerical example the arbitrageur is guaranteed to do better than would be achieved by investing domestically.]]
An arbitrageur executes a covered interest arbitrage strategy by exchanging domestic currency for foreign currency at the current [[spot exchange rate]], then investing the foreign currency at the foreign interest rate. Simultaneously, the arbitrageur negotiates a forward contract to sell the amount of the [[future value]] of the foreign investment at a delivery date consistent with the foreign investment's [[maturity (finance)|maturity]] date, to receive domestic currency in exchange for the foreign-currency funds.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 10th Edition | author = Carbaugh, Robert J. | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 978-0-324-52724-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, as per the chart at right consider that an investor with $5,000,000 USD is considering whether to invest abroad using a covered interest arbitrage strategy or to invest domestically. The dollar deposit interest rate is 3.4% in the [[United States]], while the euro deposit rate is 4.6% in the [[euro area]]. The current spot exchange rate is 1.2730 $/€ and the six-month forward exchange rate is 1.3000 $/€. For simplicity, the example ignores compounding interest. Investing $5,000,000 USD domestically at 3.4% for six months ignoring compounding, will result in a future value of $5,085,000 USD. However, exchanging $5,000,000 dollars for euros today, investing those euros at 4.6% for six months ignoring compounding, and exchanging the future value of euros for dollars at the [[forward exchange rate]] (on the delivery date negotiated in the forward contract), will result in $5,223,488 USD, implying that investing abroad using covered interest arbitrage is the superior alternative.

==Effect of arbitrage==

If there were no impediments, such as [[transaction cost]]s, to covered interest arbitrage, then any opportunity, however minuscule, to profit from it would immediately be exploited by many financial market participants, and the resulting pressure on domestic and forward interest rates and the [[Forward premium|forward exchange rate premium]] would cause one or more of these to change virtually instantaneously to eliminate the opportunity. In fact, the anticipation of such arbitrage leading to such market changes would cause these three variables to align to prevent any arbitrage opportunities from even arising in the first place: incipient arbitrage can have the same effect, but sooner, as actual arbitrage. Thus any evidence of empirical deviations from covered interest parity would have to be explained on the grounds of some friction in the financial markets.

==Evidence for covered interest arbitrage opportunities==
Economists Robert M. Dunn, Jr. and John H. Mutti note that financial markets may generate data inconsistent with interest rate parity, and that cases in which significant covered interest arbitrage profits appeared feasible were often due to assets not sharing the same perceptions of risk, the potential for [[double taxation]] due to differing policies, and investors' concerns over the imposition of [[foreign exchange controls]] cumbersome to the enforcement of forward contracts. Some covered interest arbitrage opportunities have appeared to exist when exchange rates and interest rates were collected for different periods; for example, the use of daily interest rates and daily closing exchange rates could render the illusion that arbitrage profits exist.&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 6th Edition | author = Dunn, Robert M., Jr. | author2 = Mutti, John H. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-31154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have suggested an array of other factors to account for observed deviations from interest rate parity, such as differing tax treatment, differing risks, government foreign exchange controls, supply or [[price elasticity of demand|demand inelasticity]], transaction costs, and time differentials between observing and executing arbitrage opportunities. Economists [[Jacob Frenkel]] and Richard M. Levich investigated the performance of covered interest arbitrage strategies during the 1970s' [[exchange-rate flexibility|flexible]] [[exchange-rate regime|exchange rate regime]] by examining transaction costs and differentials between observing and executing arbitrage opportunities. Using weekly data, they estimated transaction costs and evaluated their role in explaining deviations from interest rate parity and found that most deviations could be explained by transaction costs. However, accommodating transaction costs did not explain observed deviations from covered interest rate parity between treasury bills in the United States and [[United Kingdom]]. Frenkel and Levich found that executing such transactions resulted in only illusory opportunities for arbitrage profits, and that in each execution the [[mean]] percentage of profit decreased such that there was no [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] difference from zero profitability. Frenkel and Levich concluded that unexploited opportunities for profit do not exist in covered interest arbitrage.&lt;ref name="Frenkel &amp; Levich 1981"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Covered interest arbitrage in the 1970's | journal = Economics Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–274 | year = 1981 | author = Frenkel, Jacob A. | author2 = Levich, Richard M. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016517658190077X | accessdate = 2011-07-15 | doi=10.1016/0165-1765(81)90077-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a time series dataset of daily spot and forward USD/[[Japanese yen|JPY]] exchange rates and same-maturity short-term interest rates in both the United States and Japan, economists Johnathan A. Batten and Peter G. Szilagyi analyzed the sensitivity of forward market price differentials to short-term interest rate differentials. The researchers found evidence for substantial variation in covered interest rate parity deviations from equilibrium, attributed to transaction costs and [[market segmentation]]. They found that such deviations and arbitrage opportunities diminished significantly nearly to a point of elimination by the year 2000. Batten and Szilagyi point out that the modern reliance on [[electronic trading platform]]s and real-time equilibrium prices appear to account for the removal of the historical scale and scope of covered interest arbitrage opportunities. Further investigation of the deviations uncovered a long-term dependence, found to be consistent with other evidence of temporal long-term dependencies identified in asset returns from other [[financial markets]] including currencies, [[stock]]s, and [[commodity|commodities]].&lt;ref name="Batten &amp; Szilagyi 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Covered interest parity arbitrage and temporal long-term dependence between the US dollar and the Yen | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 376 | issue = 1 | pages = 409–421 | year = 2007 | author = Batten, Jonathan A. | author2 = Szilagyi, Peter G. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106010715 | accessdate = 2011-07-14 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2006.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists Wai-Ming Fong, Giorgio Valente, and Joseph K.W. Fung, examined the relationship of covered interest rate parity arbitrage opportunities with [[market liquidity]] and [[credit risk]] using a dataset of [[high-frequency trading|tick-by-tick]] spot and forward exchange rate quotes for the [[Hong Kong dollar]] in relation to the [[United States dollar]]. Their empirical analysis demonstrates that positive deviations from covered interest rate parity indeed compensate for liquidity and credit risk. After accounting for these [[risk premium|risk premia]], the researchers demonstrated that small residual arbitrage profits accrue only to those arbitrageurs capable of negotiating low transaction costs.&lt;ref name="Fong et al. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Covered interest arbitrage profits: The role of liquidity and credit risk | journal = Journal of Banking &amp; Finance | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 1098–1107 | year = 2010 | author = Fong, Wai-Ming | author2 = Valente, Giorgio | author3 = Fung, Joseph K.W. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426609003057 | accessdate = 2011-07-15 | doi=10.1016/j.jbankfin.2009.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5755">'''David Abraham Blech''' (born November 25, 1955) is an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]], [[investor]], and [[venture capitalist]]. He is one of the financial pioneers of the [[biotech]] industry and was once known as the "King of Biotech".

==Early life and education==
Blech graduated from [[Baruch College]] and earned a Master's in Music Education at the Teacher's College of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/06/19/72129/ | work=CNN | first=Gene | last=Bylinsky | title=WHAT A WAY TO START A COMPANY! A pharmaceuticals giant has put more than $70 million into Nova, a fledgling outfit that didn't even have a lab before it went public -- and still hasn't marketed a product | date=19 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Since 1980 Mr. Blech has been a founder of companies and venture capital investor in the biotechnology sector. His initial venture investment, Genetic Systems Corporation, which he helped found with his father and his brother Isaac Blech, was built around promising scientists, including the high profile microbiologist Robert Nowinski. It developed the first inexpensive and accurate test to diagnosis sexually-transmitted diseases using [[monoclonal antibodies]], allowing tens of thousands of babies to be born to women who otherwise would have become sterile from [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifesciencesfoundation.org/events-Genetic_Systems_Inc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The company was sold to [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers]] in 1986 for $294 million (3%) of Bristol Myers stock.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walters|first=Donna|title=Bristol-Myers Agrees to Buy Genetic Systems : Syntex Bought Out of Deal With Biotech Firm|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-04/business/fi-4255_1_genetic-systems|work=Bristol-Myers Agrees to Buy Genetic Systems : Syntex Bought Out of Deal With Biotech Firm|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 February 2012|date=4 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Blech co-founded [[Icos Corporation]] with Nowinski and George B. Rathmann, receiving the largest start up financing in biotech history at $33 million. Icos discovered the drug Cialis, which was acquired by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 2003 for over $2.6 billion. The Blechs also co-founded [[Celgene]] Corporation in 1986, which was a unit of the [[Celanese Corporation]], and was spun off as an independent company following the merger of [[Celanese Corporation]] with American Hoechst Corporation. Celgene introduced two major cancer drugs, and has a current value of over $35 billion, making it the 5th largest biotech company in the world.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duff Wilson |author2=David Heath |title=He helped create the biotech boom and when it went bust so did he|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/uninformed_consent/financier/story1.html|work=Uninformed Consent|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies he helped found include [[DNA Plant Technology]], Neurogen Corporation, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, [[Alexion Pharmaceuticals]], [[ARIAD Pharmaceuticals|Ariad Pharmaceuticals]], [[Neurocrine Biosciences]], [[Cytosorbents]] Inc, and Intellect Neurosciences. He was also instrumental in the turnaround of Liposome Technology Inc. and Biotech General Corporation. In 1990 Mr. Blech founded D. Blech &amp; Company, which, until it ceased doing business in September 1994, was a registered broker-dealer involved in underwriting biotechnology issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=190504021&amp;targetid=profile&lt;/ref&gt;
At his peak in 1992, Blech's wealth was estimated at almost $300 million, briefly making him a member of the [[Forbes 400]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|author1=William P. Barrett |author2=Janet Novack |author3=Daniel Fisher |author4=Matthew Rand |title=And Starting to Bark|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0604/042.html|work=And Starting to Bark|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling deep into debt, D. Blech &amp; Co was in violation of [[net capital rule]]s and ceased operations on September 22, 1994, a day that came to be known as "Blech Thursday" in the biotech industry.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times" /&gt;

Blech came under investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for [[securities fraud]]. During the investigation Lloyd Schwed, a Florida-based attorney representing a group of former brokers, attempted to blackmail Blech by promising to withhold tapes subpoenaed during the investigation. Blech became an informant in exchange for leniency. He pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal fraud and was sentenced to a five-year term of probation.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times" /&gt;

==Personal==
Blech says he is [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], has a [[Behavioral addiction|gambling addiction]] and is a member of [[Gamblers Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/business/david-blech-a-biotech-king-dethroned.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | title=A Biotech King, Dethroned | date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-02/david-blech-gets-four-years-for-manipulating-stock-prices.html | work=Bloomberg | title=David Blech Gets Four Years for Manipulating Stock Prices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design manufacture service''' (DMS) is a [[business model]] that combines contract product design with [[Contract manufacturer|contract manufacturing]] as a service to other companies that have insufficient or do not possess the required resources.  Often the customer is focused on other aspects of their business or their existing resources may simply be overloaded. DMS providers may also provide other services such as order fulfillment, [[logistics]] and [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] service.

Because of the high skill-levels required in each field, DMS firms specialize in different product categories.  These might include medical devices, medical instruments, automotive, communications, etc.  Typically, these are areas that require a relatively higher level of internal infrastructure or regulatory controls than the customer possesses. Certain industries including aviation and medical devices&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm070642.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; require special development and manufacturing practices required by international, Federal and local regulations.

One of the key differences between the DMS model and other contract manufacturing such as [[original design manufacturer]] (ODM), is the way [[intellectual property]] (IP) is treated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/sme/en/documents/pdf/ip_innovation_development.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In the DMS model, IP comes from three basic sources.  These include (a) IP previously owned and contributed by the customer, (b) IP previously owned and contributed to the product by the DMS and (c) new or original IP created at the request of and paid by the customer.  The latter (c) is commonly referred to as "[[work for hire]]". With DMS, the customer ultimately has rights to all of the IP embodied in the product.  This is especially important in industries like medical devices where customer owned IP is critical.&lt;ref&gt;http://knobbe.com/pdf/2012-August-MEDS-What-Medical-Device-Companies-Need-To-Know-Intellectual-Property.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Some contract product development models, including [[Original design manufacturer|Original Design Manufacturing]] (ODM),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/original-design-manufacturer&lt;/ref&gt; allow the developer, instead of the customer, to retain IP rights.

'''Downtown Calgary''' is a region of central [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], it contains the second largest concentration of head offices in Canada.&lt;ref name=CanadaWest&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Full_Publication.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714171448/http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/StateWest2010_Full_Publication.pdf | archivedate=July 14, 2011 | title=State of the West 2010: Western Canadian Demographic and Economic Trends | publisher=[[Canada West Foundation]] | type=PDF | pages=65 &amp; 102 | year=2010 | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is divided into several neighbourhoods, the Central Business District, [[Eau Claire, Calgary|Eau Claire]], [[Chinatown, Calgary|Chinatown]], [[Downtown East Village, Calgary|East Village]], and the [[Downtown West End, Calgary|West End]]. There are a number of districts within Downtown Calgary as well, most of them being within the Central Business District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgarydowntown.com/dynamic.php?pageId=4 | title= Downtown Districts | author= Downtown Calgary Association| year=2005 | accessdate= 2017-02-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006202128/http://www.calgarydowntown.com/dynamic.php?pageId=4 |archivedate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, downtown Calgary is bordered by 14th Street W. on the west, the [[Bow River]] and [[Prince's Island Park]] on the north, the [[Elbow River]] on the east and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] mainline tracks on the south. The neighbourhoods of the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]] and [[Mission, Calgary|Mission]] to the immediate south are often considered part of downtown, due to the high concentrations of businesses, high population densities, and occurrence of retail and nightlife opportunities, but strictly speaking they are not technically part of downtown.

The population of Calgary's downtown has grown substantially in recent years, growing by several thousand between 2011 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://globalnews.ca/map/3229973/ | title= Population Change 2011 - 2016 | author=Global News and Statistics Canada| year=2017 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the population of the five combined downtown neighbourhoods surpassing 18 000 {{as of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.calgary.ca/CA/city-clerks/Documents/Election-and-information-services/Census2016/2016-Census-Results-Community-Tables.pdf | title= Comparative Community Results | author=City of Calgary| year=2016 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Calgary now has a significantly larger population than that of other Canadian cities of similar size, such as [[Downtown Ottawa|Ottawa]] and [[Downtown Edmonton|Edmonton]].&lt;ref&gt;(Census tract number 5050048.00) http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&amp;T=1601&amp;SR=51&amp;S=94&amp;O=A&amp;RPP=25&amp;PR=0&amp;CMA=505&amp;CSD=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbhds&gt;{{cite web | url=https://data.edmonton.ca/City-Administration/Neighbourhoods-data-plus-kml-file-/65fr-66s6 | title=Neighbourhoods | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While downtown Calgary continues to grow, the Beltline neighbourhood to the immediate south, with a population of 21,958 {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, is taking up the majority of residential development in inner city Calgary.&lt;ref name=DevelopmentMap&gt;{{cite web| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/maps/?cityID=3&amp;z=13&amp;status=1 | author=SkyscraperPage | title=Development Map Calgary | year=2017 | accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calgary Transit]]'s [[C-Train]] [[light rail]] system runs down 7th Avenue S. through the middle of downtown in a E-W direction, and the ride is free on this section. While the newly proposed Green Line of the C-Train will run underground through downtown under 2nd Street, running in a N-S direction.

==Neighbourhoods==
===Commercial core===
Calgary's dense business area comprises the bulk of the downtown community. It is a core of skyscrapers. {{as of|2017|February}}, eight of the [[List of Calgary's 10 tallest skyscrapers|ten tallest buildings]] in western [[Canada]], and a few of the tallest in the country, are in Calgary. It is arguably the densest downtown area of any city of its size in North America. Many of the buildings are connected via an {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long network of elevated walkways and bridges. The system, known as the "[[Plus 15|+15]]" is the largest of its kind in the world.

The area surrounding the [[Stephen Avenue|Stephen Avenue Walk]] is Downtown Calgary's primary retail area. Stephen Avenue (8th Avenue SW) is a pedestrian mall lined with historic buildings containing stores, restaurants, cinemas, and drinking establishments. Immediately adjacent to the outdoor portion of Stephen Avenue is an indoor complex of two shopping malls. The malls, [[The Core Shopping Centre (Calgary)|The Core Shopping Centre]] (formerly TD Square/Calgary Eaton Centre) and the [[Scotia Centre (Calgary)|Scotia Centre]] are bordered at either end by the historic [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay Company]] store and [[Holt Renfrew|Holt Renfrew's]] upscale department store. The street is also home to a number of galleries, restaurants, pubs, off-beat cinemas, and nightclubs. Other attractions in the commercial core include the [[Devonian Gardens (Calgary)|Devonian Gardens]] in The Core, the [[Calgary Tower]], the Art Gallery of Calgary, The [[Glenbow Museum]], Olympic Plaza, [[Arts Commons]], and the Telus Convention Centre.

The commercial core is also divided into a number of districts. They include the Entertainment District/Stephen Avenue, The Olympic Plaza and Cultural District, and the Government District.

[[File:The East Village in 2015.jpg|thumb|East Village is a downtown neighbourhood that hosts a number of amenities, including the [[Jack and Jean Leslie RiverWalk|RiverWalk]].]]
The East Village is an area to the east of the Downtown Commercial Core. This area was plagued by crime and homelessness for a long time. However, the area has seen a great amount of redevelopment since the late 2000s. In 2007, the [[Calgary Municipal Land Corporation]] began construction on $357 million worth of infrastructure upgrades to the neighbourhood, bringing all streets above flood plain levels, upgrading sewers and storm drains, and building plazas.

The neighbourhood has since become a new hot-spot for the downtown area, playing host to the award-winning [[Jack and Jean Leslie RiverWalk|RiverWalk]], several restaurants in the historic Simmons Mattress Factory building, and several new condo towers, with several more under construction. The neighbourhood is host to the $191 million [[National Music Centre|National Music Centre of Canada]], and will be host to the $245 million [[Calgary Central Library|New Central Library]] of the [[Calgary Public Library]] system. Since the redevelopment has started, the neighbourhood has seen $2.7 billion worth of investment.&lt;ref name=Construction&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evexperience.com/construction | title=Construction | publisher=EV Experience | accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">'''Forged endorsement''' is a legal term used to describe a fraudulent payment. For example, someone may write a cheque with a forged signature. In this case the forged signature makes the endorsement fraudulent. Forging endorsements can be use to prevent the person or legal entity that the payment is made out to from being able to receive its value (such as cashing a cheque).

==Legal description==

If an [[Financial instrument|instrument]] is endorsed in full, it cannot be endorsed or negotiated except by an [[Negotiable instrument|endorsement]] signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is payable. Thus, if such an instrument is negotiated by way of a forged endorsement, the endorsee will not acquire the title even though he be a purchaser for value and in good faith, because the endorsement is [[Legal nullity|nullity]]. But where the instrument has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery and the holder derives his title independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.

== Examples==
A bill is endorsed, “payable to X or order”. X endorses it in blank and it comes into the hands of Y, who simply delivers it to A. A would then forge Y's endorsement and transfers it to B. B, as the holder, does not derive his title through the forged endorsement to Y, but through the genuine endorsement of X and can claim payment from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement.

'''Fort Howard Paper Company''' was an American [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] company based in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. Its products were sold under a variety of brand names, including ''Envision'', ''Fort Howard'', ''Mardi Gras'', and ''Soft'n Gentle''.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

The company merged with [[James River Corporation]] in 1997 to form the [[Fort James Corporation]]; it became part of [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 2000.

==History==
[[File:BALES BY THE THOUSANDS FORM PAPER BULWARK OUTSIDE THE FORT HOWARD PAPER COMPANY ON THE SHORES OF GREEN BAY - NARA - 550883.tif|thumb|Paper bales outside the Green Bay mill]]
[[Austin E. Cofrin]] founded the Fort Howard Paper Company in 1919. It was named after [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]], a [[19th century]] [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[fortification]] located along the west bank of the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] in Green Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forttours.com/pages/fortedwardaugustus.asp Fort Edward August]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.com/Company/Company-Overview/Locations/Green-Bay.aspx#tab-0 |title=Green Bay operations |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the company began experimenting with recycled paper production.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1960, Austin E. Cofrin stepped down as CEO, and handed control of the company to his son, John P. Cofrin.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

In 1971, the company was taken public, and common stock was offered.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1976, the company began construction on its second facility in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt; 

In 1980, the company acquired [[The Harmon Group]] of [[New York City]]. They also expanded internationally by acquiring [[The Sterling Group]] of [[Manchester, England]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1983, they purchased the [[Maryland Cup Corporation]], the largest manufacturer of paper and plastic food products.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

In 1988, the company was taken private, and in 1989 they sold their cup operations, because it was not cost effective.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

In 1997, the company merged with another Green Bay paper company, the James River Corporation. The new company became the Fort James Corporation.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt; Three years later, the Fort James Corporation was acquired by [[Georgia-Pacific]].&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1990, the Fort Howard Paper Company was recognized with the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] Administrator’s Award for Recycling Leadership.&lt;ref name=uwgb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/archives/files/pdf/Containerlist-Jeans.pdf |title=Fort Howard Company Records |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Green Bay |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, they received the National Recycling Coalition Award for Recycling Innovation as well as the American Paper Institute’s Environmental and Energy Achievement Award.&lt;ref name=uwgb/&gt;

==Legacy==
The historical records of the Fort Howard Paper Company are housed at the Area Research Center at the [[University of Wisconsin-Green Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uwgb.edu/featured/giving-back/10/26/major-gift-fort-howard/ |title=Photos: Major gift evokes Fort Howard Paper history |author=Christopher Sampson |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Green Bay |date=October 26, 2009 |access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grief counseling''' is a form of [[psychotherapy]] that aims to help people cope with the physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and cognitive responses to loss. These experiences are commonly thought to be brought on by a loved person's death, but may more broadly be understood as shaped by any significant life-altering loss (e.g., [[divorce]], home foreclosure, or job loss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kneip|first1=Richard|title=Psychology of Grief|url=https://www.greatlakespsychologygroup.com/specialty-areas/grief-counseling/|website=GLPG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grief counselors believe that everyone experiences and expresses grief in personally unique ways that are shaped by family background, culture, life experiences, personal values, and intrinsic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942843686|title=Bereavement groups and the role of social support : integrating theory, research, and practice|last=Hoy|first=William G.|publisher=Routledge/Taylor and Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781317416357|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=942843686}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it is not uncommon for a person to withdraw from their friends and family and feel helpless; some might be angry and want to take action. Some may laugh while others experience strong regrets or guilt. Tears or the lack of crying can both be seen as appropriate expressions of grief.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1032303183|title=Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy : A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner|last=William,|first=Worden, J.|isbn=9780826134752|edition= Fifth |location=New York, NY|oclc=1032303183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grief counselors know that one can expect a wide range of emotion and behavior associated with grief. Some counselors believe that in virtually all places and cultures, the grieving person benefits from the support of others.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeau, Janice Winchester: ''Families Making Sense of Death''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Further, grief counselors believe that where such support is lacking, counseling may provide an avenue for healthy resolution. Grief counselors also believe that where the process of grieving is interrupted, for example, by the one who is grieving having to simultaneously deal with practical issues of survival or by their having to be the strong one who is striving to hold their family together, grief can remain unresolved and later resurface as an issue for [[counseling]].

'''Grief counseling''' becomes necessary when a person is so disabled by their grief; and, so overwhelmed by their loss that their normal coping processes are disabled or shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, Robert: ''Lessons of Loss: A Guide to Coping''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Grief counseling facilitates expression of [[emotion]] and thought about the loss, including their feeling sad, anxious, angry, lonely, guilty, relieved, isolated, confused, or numb.

It includes thinking creatively about the challenges that follow loss and coping with concurrent changes in their lives. Often people feel disorganized, tired, have trouble concentrating, sleep poorly and have vivid dreams, and they may experience the change in appetite. These too are addressed in counseling.

Grief counseling facilitates the process of resolution in the natural reactions to loss. It is appropriate for reaction to losses that have overwhelmed a person's coping ability. There are considerable resources online covering grief or loss counseling such as the Grief Counseling Resource Guide from the New York State Office of Mental Health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/grief/GriefCounselingResourceGuide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Grief counseling may be called upon when a person suffers [[anticipatory grief]], for example, an intrusive and frequent worry about a loved one whose death is neither imminent nor likely. Anticipatory mourning also occurs when a loved one has a [[terminal illness]]. This can handicap that person's ability to stay present whilst simultaneously holding onto, letting go of, and drawing closer to the dying relative.&lt;ref&gt;Rando, Therese A.: ''Clinical Dimensions of Anticipatory Mourning''. Champaign, IL: Research Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanne Jozefowski in 1999 through ''The Phoenix Phenomenon: Rising from the Ashes of Grief''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0765702098}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes '''five stages''' to rebuild a shattered life.

* '''Impact''': shock, denial, anxiety, fear, and panic.
* '''Chaos''': confusion, disbelief, actions out of control, irrational thoughts and feelings, feeling despair, feeling helpless, desperate searching, lose track of time, difficulty sleeping and eating, obsessive focus on the loved one and their possessions, agony from imagining their physical harm, shattered beliefs.
* '''Adapting''': bringing order back into daily life while you continue to grieve: take care of basic needs (personal grooming, shopping, cooking, cleaning, paying bills), learn to live without the loved one, accept help, focus on helping children cope, connect with other grieving families for mutual support, take control of grieving so that grief does not control you, slowly accept the new reality.
* '''Equilibrium''': attaining stability and routines: reestablish a life that works all right, enjoy pleasant activities with family members and good times with friends, do productive work, choose a positive new direction in life while honoring the past, learn how to handle people who ask questions about what you’ve been through.
* '''Transformation''': rethinking your purpose in life and the basis for your identity; looking for meaning in tragic, senseless loss; allowing yourself to have both painful and positive feelings about your loss and become able to choose which feelings you focus on; allowing yourself to discover that your struggle has led you to develop a stronger, better version of yourself than you expected could exist; learning how to talk with others about your heroic healing journey without exposing them to your pain; becoming supportive of others trying to deal with their losses.

== Grief therapy ==
There is a distinction between grief counseling and [[grief therapy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Counseling involves helping people move through uncomplicated, or normal, grief to health and resolution. Grief therapy involves the use of clinical tools for traumatic or complicated grief reactions.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, Shelby 2000"&gt;Jacobs, Shelby, Carolyn Mazure, and Holly Prigerson. ''Diagnostic Criteria for Traumatic Grief.'' Death Studies 24 (2000):185–199&lt;/ref&gt; This could occur where the grief reaction is prolonged or manifests itself through some bodily or behavioral symptom, or by a grief response outside the range of cultural or psychiatrically defined normality.&lt;ref&gt;Worden, J. William. ''Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy'', 2nd edition. New York: Springer, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Grief therapy is a kind of [[psychotherapy]] used to treat severe or complicated traumatic [[grief]] reactions,&lt;ref name="Jacobs, Shelby 2000"/&gt; which are usually brought on by the loss of a close person (by separation or [[death]]) or by community disaster. The goal of grief therapy is to identify and solve the psychological and [[emotion]]al problems which appeared as a consequence.

They may appear as [[behavioral]] or physical changes, psychosomatic disturbances, delayed or extreme [[mourning]], conflictual problems or sudden and unexpected mourning). Grief therapy may be available as individual or [[group therapy]]. A common area where grief therapy has been extensively applied is with the parents of [[cancer]] patients.

=== Controversies ===

==== Efficacy and iatrogenesis ====

At present (as of 2008), a controversy exists in the scholarly literature regarding grief therapy's relative efficacy and the possible harm from it ([[iatrogenesis]]). Researchers have suggested that people may resort to receiving grief therapy in the absence of complicated (or abnormal) grief reactions and that, in such cases, grief therapy may cause a normal bereavement response to turn [[pathological]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neimeyer | first1 = R.A. | year = 2000 | title = Searching for the meaning of meaning: Grief therapy and the process of reconstruction | url = | journal = Death Studies | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 541–558 | doi=10.1080/07481180050121480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that grief therapy is highly effective for people who suffer from unusually prolonged and complicated responses to bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = D.G. | last2 = Hoyt | first2 = W.T. | year = 2007 | title = What has become of grief counseling? En evaluation of the empirical foundations of the new pessimism. | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.38.4.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, an article in the [[Association for Psychological Science|APS]] journal, ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', included grief counseling and grief therapy on a list of treatments with the potential to cause harm to clients.&lt;ref name=lilienfeld&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lilienfeld | first1 = S. O. | year = 2007 | title = Psychological treatments that cause harm | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 53–70 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, individuals experiencing "relatively normal bereavement reactions" were said to be at risk of a worse outcome{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} after receiving grief counselling. The APS journal article in turn has been criticized in the [[British Psychological Society]]'s publication ''the psychologist'' as lacking scientific rigour.&lt;ref name=jarret_jan2008&gt;[http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=21&amp;editionID=155&amp;ArticleID=1290 "When therapy causes harm"], by Christian Jarrett, ''the psychologist'', Volume 21, Part I, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Validity of "complicated grief" ====
{{main|Traumatic grief}}
Some mental health professionals have questioned whether complicated grief exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VB8-4D48XGN-2&amp;_user=18704&amp;_coverDate=10%2F01%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1644208314&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000002018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=18704&amp;md5=9513ea74b8d948a69bdcc58ece3da9bd&amp;searchtype=a |title=Clinical Psychology Review - A case for establishing complicated grief as a distinct mental disorder in DSM-V  |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.07.002 |volume=24 |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |pages=637–662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://baywood.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,13;journal,42,246;linkingpublicationresults,1:300329,1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/3/290 |title=PsychiatryOnline &amp;#124; FOCUS: The Journal of Lifelong Learning in Psychiatry &amp;#124; Diagnostic Criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder |publisher=Focus.psychiatryonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; New diagnostic criteria for "complicated grief" have been proposed for the new DSM, the DSM-V.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/health/29grief.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=health&lt;/ref&gt; One argument against creating a classification for "complicated grief" holds that it is not a unique mental disorder. Rather it is a combination of other mental disorders, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], and [[personality disorders]].

Empirical studies have been attempting to convincingly establish the [[incremental validity]] of complicated grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonanno | first1 = G.A. | year = 2006 | title = Is Complicated Grief a Valid Construct? | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 129–134 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2006.00014.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[George Bonanno]] and colleagues published a paper describing a study that supports the incremental validity of complicated grief.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.tc.columbia.edu/upload/gab38/2007_Bonanno,Neria,Mancini,Coifman,Litz,&amp;Insel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The paper cautions, "the question of how complicated grief symptoms might be organized diagnostically is still very much open to debate." As this is a current debate in the field, new research on this topic is likely to appear in the scientific literature.

==Trauma counseling==
Anticipating the impact of loss or trauma (to the extent than anyone can), and during and after the events of loss or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], each person has unique emotional experiences and ways of coping, of grieving and of reacting or not. Sudden, violent or unexpected loss or trauma imposes additional strains on coping. When a community is affected such as by [[disaster]] both the cost and sometimes the supports are greater.

Weeping, painful feelings of sadness, anger, shock, guilt, helplessness and outrage are not uncommon. These are particularly challenging times for children&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Nader, K. ''Understanding and Assessing Trauma in Children and Adolescents Measures, Methods, and Youth in Context''. Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who may have had little experience managing strong affects within themselves or in their family. These feelings are all part of a natural healing process that draws on the resilience of the person, family and community.

Time and the comfort and support of understanding loved ones and once strangers who come to their aid, supports people healing in their own time and their own way. Research shows that resilience is ordinary rather than extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Resilience'', APA Pamphlet http://www.apahelpcenter.org/dl/the_road_to_resilience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of people who survive loss and trauma do not go on to develop [[PTSD]]. Some remain overwhelmed.

This article addresses counseling with complex grief and trauma,&lt;ref name="Jacobs, Shelby 2000"/&gt; not only [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] but those conditions of traumatic loss and [[psychological trauma]] that for a number of reasons are enduring or disabling. For example, where an adult is periodically immobilised by unwelcome and intrusive recall of the sudden and violent death&lt;ref&gt;Rynearson E.K, Editor: ''Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis'', Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of a parent in their childhood.

One that they were unable to grieve because they were the strong one who held the family together, or whose feelings of outrage and anger were unacceptable or unmanageable at the time or because the loss of the breadwinner catapulted the family into a precipitous fall losing home, community and means of support.

===The post-trauma self===
Because of the interconnectedness of trauma, PTSD, human development, resiliency and the integration of the [[Self (psychology)|self]], counseling of the complex traumatic aftermath of a violent death in the family, for example, require an integrative approach, using a variety of skills and [[Integrative Psychotherapy|techniques]] to best fit the presentation of the problem.

Disruption in the previously supportive bonds of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] and of the person's ability to manage their own affects challenges traditional, so called 'non-directive' client centered counseling approaches. One example of this paradigm shift in approaches is the [[Multitheoretical Psychotherapy]] of Jeff Brooks-Harris.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks-Harris, J. E. (2008). ''Integrative Multitheoretical Psychotherapy''. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-traumatic self may not be the same person as before.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson J.P, ''The Posttraumatic Self Restoring Meaning and Wholeness to Personality'', Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the source of shame, secondary shocks after the event and of grief for the lost unaltered self, which impacts on family and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wislon | first1 = J.P'' | year = 2006 | title = Posttraumatic Shame and Guilt | url = | journal = Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 122–141 | doi = 10.1177/1524838005285914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling in these circumstances is designed to maximize safety, trauma processing, and reintegration regardless of the specific treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Julian D. Ford, Christine A. Courtois, Kathy Steele, Onno van der Hart, Ellert R. S. Nijenhuis ''Treatment of complex posttraumatic self-dysregulation'', Journal of Traumatic Stress Volume 18, Issue 5, Pages 437 - 447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frewen | first1 = Paul A. | last2 = Lanius | first2 = Ruth A. | year = | title = Toward a Psychobiology of Posttraumatic Self-Dysregulation.

Lee was born near [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]]. He was the son of [[Henry Lee II|Col. Henry Lee II]] (1730–1787) of "Leesylvania" and Lucy Grymes (1734–1792). His father was the first cousin of [[Richard Henry Lee]], twelfth [[President of the Continental Congress]]. His mother was an aunt of the wife of [[Virginia Governor]] [[Thomas Nelson, Jr.]] His great-grandmother Mary Bland was also a grand-aunt of President [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Lee was the grandson of [[Henry Lee I|Capt. Henry Lee I]], a great-grandson of [[Richard Bland (burgess)|Richard Bland]], and a great-great-grandson of [[William Randolph]].&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John Forrest |editor1-last=Dillon |editor1-link=John Forrest Dillon |title=John Marshall; life, character and judicial services as portrayed in the centenary and memorial addresses and proceedings throughout the United States on Marshall day, 1901, and in the classic orations of Binney, Story, Phelps, Waite and Rawle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHlAAAAAYAAJ |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume=I |year=1903 |publisher=Callaghan &amp; Company |location=Chicago |oclc= |pages=liv–lv |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a descendant of [[Theodorick Bland of Westover]] and Governor [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]].

===Military career===
[[File:Letter of Henry Lee to Shreve 1780.jpg|thumb|Letter from Henry Lee to [[Israel Shreve|Colonel Shreve]], Burlington, May 12, 1780]]
Lee graduated from the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1773, and began pursuing a legal career. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he instead became a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in a [[Virginia]] [[dragoon]] detachment, which was attached to the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons]]. In 1778, Lee was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and given the command of a mixed corps of cavalry and infantry known as [[Lee's Legion]], with which he won a great reputation as a capable leader of light troops. At the time, highly mobile groups of light cavalry provided valuable service not only during major battles, but also by conducting reconnaissance and surveillance, engaging the enemy during troop movements, disrupting delivery of supplies, doing raiding and skirmishing, and organizing expedition behind enemy lines;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author= Hinde, Captain Robert|publisher= W.Owen|publication-place=London|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jB5EAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Discipline of the Light-Horse|year= 1778|accessdate= August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haythornthwaite, Philip J, and Adam Hook. ''Napoleonic Light Cavalry Tactics.'' Botley, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; part of such tactics now are known as [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[maneuver warfare]]. In September of the same year, Lee commanded a unit of dragoons which defeated a Hessian regiment at the [[Battle of Edgar's Lane]].

It was during his time as commander of the Legion that Lee earned the sobriquet of "Light-Horse Harry" for his horsemanship. On September 22, 1779 the Continental Congress voted to present Lee with a gold medal—a reward given to no other officer below a general's rank—for the Legion's actions during the [[Battle of Paulus Hook]] in [[New Jersey]], on August 19 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;The medal (which is actually silver) finally presented to Lee is in Princeton University’s Numismatic Collection. Also included are a signed letter of Lee's to the New Jersey quartermaster from 1780 and a signed letter of the same year from [[George Washington]] to Lee approving Lee’s plan to capture [[Benedict Arnold]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.princeton.edu/about/news/lm011106.php Discovery of medal that Congress granted to Lee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901171927/http://library.princeton.edu/about/news/lm011106.php |date=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and was assigned with his Legion to the southern theater of war. Lee's Legion raided the British outpost of Georgetown, South Carolina with General Francis Marion in January 1781 and helped screen the American army in their Race to the Dan River the following month. Lee united with General Francis Marion and General Andrew Pickens in the spring of 1781 to capture numerous British outposts in South Carolina and Georgia including [[Siege of Fort Watson|Fort Watson]], Fort Motte, [[Fort Granby]], Fort Galphin, Fort Grierson, and Fort Cornwallis, [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Thomas. ''Light-horse Harry Lee.'' New York: C. Scribner's Sons, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a campaign of terror and intimidation against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] in the region, highlighted in [[Pyle's Massacre]]. Lee and his legion also served at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], the [[Siege of Ninety-Six]], and the [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]]. He was present at [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]]'s surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], but left the Army shortly after, claiming fatigue and disappointment with his treatment from fellow officers.

In 1794, Lee was summoned by President [[George Washington]] to suppress the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in western [[Pennsylvania]]. Lee commanded the 12,950 militiamen sent to quash the rebels; because of a peaceful surrender, there was no fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiskeyrebellion.info/rebell.htm Whiskey Insurrection/Rebellion]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, in anticipation of a war with France, Henry Lee was appointed a [[Major General|major general]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. In 1808, he was recommissioned by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] as major-general when war with Great Britain was imminent; Lee organized the Virginia militia. He asked President [[James Madison]] for a commission at the onset of the [[War of 1812]] but without success. In 1812 he published his ''Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States'', where he summarized his military experiences during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

===Political career===
From 1786 to 1788, Lee was a delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], and in 1788 at the [[Virginia]] convention; he favored the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]]. From 1789 to 1791, he served in the [[State legislature (United States)|General Assembly]] and, from 1791 to 1794, was [[List of Governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]]; a new [[Lee County, Virginia|county of Virginia]] was named after him during his governorship.&lt;ref&gt;Templin, Thomas E. ''Henry Light Horse Harry Lee: A Biography.'' Ph.D. dissertation. Lexington, Ky: University of Kentucky, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1799 to 1801, he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[Sixth United States Congress|Congress]]. He famously [[Eulogy|eulogized]] Washington to a crowd of 4,000 at the first President's funeral on December 26, 1799 as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |title=Papers of George Washington |publisher=Gwpapers.virginia.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228192657/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |archivedate=February 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Between April 8 and 13, 1782, at [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]], Lee married his second cousin, Matilda Ludwell Lee (1764–1790), who was known as "the Divine Matilda". She was the daughter of Philip Ludwell Lee, Sr., and Elizabeth Steptoe. Matilda had three children before she died in 1790:
* Philip Ludwell Lee (1784–1794)
* Lucy Grymes Lee (1786–1860)
* [[Henry Lee IV]] (May 28, 1787 – January 30, 1837), was a historian and author who also served as a speech writer for both [[John C. Calhoun]] and presidential candidate [[Andrew Jackson]], also helping the latter to write his inaugural address.

On June 18, 1793, Lee married the wealthy [[Anne Hill Carter Lee|Anne Hill Carter]] (1773–1829) at [[Shirley Plantation]]. Anne was the daughter of Charles Carter, [[Esq.]], of Shirley, and his wife Ann Butler Moore.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, William W. ''[http://www.civilwarhome.com/leeancestors.htm The Descent Of General Robert Edward Lee From Robert The Bruce, Of Scotland]'', ''Civilwarhome.com''. Retrieved October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They had six children:
* Algernon Sidney Lee (April 2, 1795 – August 9, 1796), died at [[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]] Plantation, buried there in an unmarked grave&lt;ref name="Gamble"&gt;Gamble, Robert S. '' Sully: Biography of a House'' (Sully Foundation Ltd: Chantilly, VA, 1973), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles Carter Lee (1798–1871)
* Anne Kinloch Lee (1800–1864)
* [[Sydney Smith Lee]] (1802–1869)
* [[Robert E. Lee|Robert Edward Lee]] (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870), the fifth child of Henry and Anne, served as [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general-in-chief during the [[American Civil War]].  
* Mildred Lee (1811–1856)

===Later life===
[[Image:HenryLeehouse.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lee's house in Alexandria, Virginia]]
After retiring from public service in 1801, he lived with his family at [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]] and unsuccessfully tried to manage his plantation. The [[Panic of 1796–1797]] and bankruptcy of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] reduced Lee's fortune. In 1809, he became bankrupt and served one year in [[debtors' prison]] in [[Montross, Virginia]]; his son, Robert Lee was two years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html|title= A Princeton Companion (Lee, Henry)|year=1978|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html| title= Stratford Hall/Lee Family Tree: Henry Lee III|accessdate= August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After release, Lee moved his family to [[Alexandria, Virginia]],

During the civil unrest in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1812, Lee received grave injuries while helping to resist an attack on his friend, [[Alexander Contee Hanson]], editor of the Baltimore newspaper, ''The Federal Republican'' on July 27, 1812. Hanson was attacked by a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] mob because his paper opposed the [[War of 1812]]. Lee and Hanson and two dozen other Federalists had taken refuge in the offices of the paper. The group surrendered to Baltimore city officials the next day and were jailed. Laborer George Woolslager led a mob that forced its way into the jail, removed the Federalists, beating and torturing them over the next three hours. All were severely injured, and one Federalist, [[James Lingan]], died.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Gilje. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3787432 The Baltimore Riots of 1812 and the Breakdown of the Anglo-American Mob Tradition], ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 13, No. 4 (Summer, 1980), pp. 547–564.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/1812_Baltimore_Riot/Sep1_1812_pamphlet/home.html ''A Contemporaneous Account of the Baltimore Riot of 1812, A Narrative of Mr. John Thompson, One of the Unfortunate Sufferers, September 1, 1812.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee suffered extensive internal injuries as well as head and face wounds, and even his speech was affected. His observed symptoms were consistent with what is now called [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].  After unsuccessful convalescence at home, he sailed to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in an effort to recuperate from his injuries. On his way back to Virginia, he died on March 25, 1818, at [[Dungeness (Cumberland Island, Georgia)|Dungeness]], on [[Cumberland Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], cared for by [[Nathanael Greene]]'s daughter Louisa. "Light-Horse Harry" was buried with full military honors, provided by an American fleet stationed near [[St. Marys, Georgia]], in a small cemetery at Dungeness. In 1913, his remains were moved to the Lee family crypt at [[Lee Chapel]], on the campus of [[Washington &amp; Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;William W. Winn. [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/private-fastness-tales-wild?page=4 Private Fastness: Tales Of Wild], ''American Heritage'', April 1972, Volume 23, Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The fictional character of Colonel Harry Burwell in the film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' according to screenwriter [[Robert Rodat]]  was inspired by the historical exploits of Henry Lee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotresource.com/thepatriot/factfiction/people/burwell.html The Patriot Film: Fact or Fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' Lee's nickname is mentioned (anachronistically) during the song "The Lees of Old Virginia," sung by the character of his older cousin [[Richard Henry Lee]].

'''International trade law''' includes the appropriate rules and customs for handling trade between countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/dynamic/guide.php?id=60#toc0|title=International Trade Law|last=Library|first=University of California Berkeley School of Law|website=www.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used in legal writings as trade between private sectors, which is not right. This branch of law is now an independent field of study as most governments have become part of the world trade, as members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Since the transaction between private sectors of different countries is an important part of the WTO activities, this latter branch of law is now a very important part of the academic works and is under study in many universities across the world.

==Overview==
International trade law should be distinguished from the broader field of [[international economic law]].  The latter could be said to encompass not only WTO law, but also law governing the international [[monetary system]] and [[currency]] regulation, as well as the law of [[international development]].

The body of rules for transnational trade in the 21st century derives from medieval commercial laws called the ''[[lex mercatoria]]'' and ''[[lex maritima]]'' — respectively, "the law for merchants on land" and "the law for merchants on the sea." Modern trade law (extending beyond bilateral treaties) began shortly after the [[Second World War]], with the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to deal with trade in goods: the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).

International trade law is based on theories of [[economic liberalism]] developed in [[Europe]] and later the [[United States]] from the 18th century onwards.

International Trade Law is an aggregate of legal rules of “international legislation” and new lex mercatoria, regulating relations in international trade. '''“International legislation”''' – international treaties and acts of international intergovernmental organizations regulating relations in international trade.
'''lex mercatoria'''  - "the law for merchants on land". Alok Narayan defines "lex mercatoria" as "any law relating to businesses" which was criticised by Professor Julius Stone.
and 
'''lex maritime'''  - "the law for merchants on sea. Alok in his recent article criticised this definition to be "too narrow" and "merely-creative". Professor Dodd and Professor Malcolm Shaw of Leeds University supported this proposition.

==World Trade Organization==
In 1995, the [[World Trade Organization]], a formal international organization to regulate trade, was established.  It is the most important development in the history of international trade law.

The purposes and structure of the organization is governed by the ''Agreement Establishing The World Trade Organization'', also known as the "[[Marrakesh Agreement]]".  It does not specify the actual rules that govern international trade in specific areas. These are found in separate treaties, annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement.

The scope of WTO :

(a) provide a framework for administration and implementation of agreements;
(b) forum for further negotiations;
(c) trade policy review mechanism; and
(d) promote greater coherence among members economics policies

Principles of the WTO:

(a) A principle of non-discrimination (most-favored-nation treatment obligation and the national treatment obligation)
(b) market access (reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade) 
(c) balancing trade liberalization and other societal interests
(d) harmonization of national regulation (TRIPS agreement, TBT agreement, SPS agreement)

==Trade in goods==
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) has been the backbone of international trade law since 1948 after the charter for international trade had been agreed upon in [[Havana]].  It contains rules relating to "unfair" trading practices — [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. Many things impacted GATT like the [[Uruguay Round]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1994 the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to take the place of the GATT. This is because the GATT was meant to be a temporary fix to trade issues, and the founders hoped for something more concrete. It took many years for this to come about, however, because of the lack of money. The British Economy was in crisis and there was not much backing from Congress to pass the new agreement.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The idea of these agreements ( WTO and [http://search.proquest.com/docview/220713673/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/20?accountid=26218 GATT] was to create an equal field for all countries in trade. This way all countries got something of equal value out of the trade. This was a difficult thing to do since every country has a different economy size. This led to the [[Trade Expansion Act|Trade Expansion act]] of 1962.{{[[Trade_Expansion_Act]}}

==Trade and intellectual property==
The World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]) agreement required signatory nations to raise [[intellectual property rights]] (also known as intellectual monopoly privileges). This arguably has had a negative impact on access to essential medicines in some nations such as less developed countries, as the local economy is not as capable of producing more technical products such as pharmaceuticals.

==Cross-border transactions==

Cross-border operations are subject to taxation by more than one country. Commercial activity that occurs among several jurisdictions or countries is called a cross-border transaction. Those involved in any international business development or international trade should be knowledgeable in [[International taxation|tax law]], as every country enforces different laws on foreign businesses. International tax planning ensures that cross-border businesses stay tax compliant and avoid or lessen [[double taxation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Dispute settlement==

Most prominent in the area of dispute settlement in international trade law is the WTO dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement body is operational since 1995 and has been very active since then with 369 cases in the time between 1 January 1995 and 1 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van den Bossche|first=Peter|title=The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization - Text, Cases and Materials|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Maastricht University|isbn=978-0-521-72759-4|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly a quarter of disputes reached an amicable solution, in other cases the parties to the dispute resorted to adjudication. The WTO dispute settlement body has exclusive and compulsory jurisdiction over disputes on WTO law (Article 23.1 Dispute Settlement Understanding&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = "Governance of International Trade Under World Trade Organization Agreements-Relationships Between World Trade Organization Agreements and Other Trade Agreements."|url = Http://search.proquest.com/docview/217554638/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/3?accountid=26218}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Jerome Lee (J. Lee) Nicholson''' (1863 - November 2, 1924) was an American accountant, industrial consultant, author and educator&lt;ref name="MC 1996"&gt;Chatfield (2014, p. 436)&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name="T 1979"&gt;Taylor (1979, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; known as pioneer in [[cost accounting]]. He is considered in the United States to be the "father of cost accounting."&lt;ref&gt;The Congress (1930). ''International Congress on Accounting, 1929: September 9–14, 1929 ... New York City.'' [Proceedings],  p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 106)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson most important contributions to cost accounting consisted of "emphasizing ''[[cost centre (business)|cost centres]]'' and the ''measuring of profits for individual departments'' based on machine hour rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattessich | first1 = Richard | authorlink = Mattessich, Richard | year = 2003 | title = Accounting research and researchers of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century: an international survey of authors, ideas and publications | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Mattessich/publication/24067177_Accounting_research_and_researchers_of_the_nineteenth_century_and_the_beginning_of_the_twentieth_century_an_international_survey_of_authors_ideas_and_publications/links/0046351e43e9b293af000000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History | volume = 13 | issue = 2| page = 143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also he helped establishing the National Association of Cost Accountants (NACA) in 1920, which resulted into the [[Institute of Management Accountants]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Mattessich]] (2007) ''Two Hundred Years of Accounting Research.'' p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Nicholson grew up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"/&gt; After attending common school and business college, he started in industry. In his spare time he studied accountancy, and eventually in 1901 he obtained his [[Certified Public Accountant]] license for the State of New York.&lt;ref name="H 1959 107"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 107)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Nicholson had started his career at the [[Keystone Bridge Company]], where he worked his way up from office boy to assistant at the engineering department. In drawing up plans for the company foreman and superintendent, he started to develop his interest in cost accounting. At the age of 21, in 1884, he moved to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] where he had obtained an accounting position.&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt; Around 1900 Nicholson started his own accountancy and consultancy firm J. Lee Nicholson and Company, specialized in cost systems for manufacturing organizations.&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt;

During World War I he served at the US [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]] as supervising cost accountant in 1917-18. He was promoted to the rank of Major,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1913, p. i)&lt;/ref&gt; and kept using his rank in public life, signed his work with Major J. Lee Nicholson, and is remembered by that name.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Accountants (1921) ''Proceedings of the International Cost Conference.'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Accounting review.'' Vol. 34. (1959), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to this position at the Ordnance Department, he was chief of the Division of Cost Accounting of the Department of Commerce. The filling of these positions gave him ample opportunity to become familiar with the war contract situation in its accounting aspects. In the summer of 1917 he was chairman of a conference of delegates from the War, Navy, and Commerce Departments, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Council of National Defense. This conference, in a pamphlet issued July 81, 1917, made certain recommendations regarding government contracts, and these recommendations are presented verbatim in Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]]'s ''Cost Accounting'' (1919).&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;  
[[File:J. Lee Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920 (2).jpg|thumb|Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920]]
Nicholson has been active in accountancy societies since the early 1900s. He joined the New York State Society of CPAs in 1902, where he became its first vice-president, and served as its president. In 1906 he also joined the [[American Association of Public Accountants]]. In 1920 Nicholson was founding president&lt;ref&gt;''Michigan Manufacturer &amp; Financial Record,'' Vol. 31. (1923). p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vangermeersch  |first= Richard | author-link1= Richard Vangermeersch |title=Review of "Proud of the Past: 75 Years of Excellence Through Leadership 1919-1994 by Grant U. Meyers, Erwin S.

Nicholson authored several books, including "Nicholson on Factory Organization and Costs" published in 1909, "Cost Accounting Theory and Practice" in 1913, and "Cost Accounting" in 1920 and several papers. All three books were published in multiple editions.

Due to his ill-health he retired and moved to California in 1922, where two years later he died suddenly November 2, 1924 in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McL 1924"&gt;McLeod, S. C., "Major J. Lee Nicholson Dies Suddenly in San Francisco," ''N.A.C.A. Bulletin,'' November 15, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Early 20th century, when Nicholson started published his first work, the development towards modern [[cost accounting]] was well underway for two decades. Chatfield (2014) summarized that "After hundreds of years of painfully slow progress, cost accounting took off during the 1880s. Between 1885 and 1920, the essentials of modern cost technique were formulated and to some extent standardized in practice. Workable overhead allocation methods were devised, procedures were developed for integrating cost and financial accounts, and [[standard costing]] became routinized."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

Chandra and Paperman (1976) specified, that "serious studies in cost accounting started only in the 1890s with the writings of [[Captain Henry Metcalfe|Metcalfe]], [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells|Fells]], [[George P. Norton|Norton]], [[J. Slater Lewis|Lewis]], and later with [[Alexander H. Church|Church]], Nicholson and [[J. Maurice Clark|Clark]]. They were truly the pioneers who introduced new cost concepts like fixed and variable costs, standard cost, cost centers, relevant costs, etc. in the literature. The development of cost accounting in this period was undoubtedly slow. In addition, cost accounting tried to adapt itself within the framework of [[financial accounting]]. Part of the delay in the establishment of cost accounting concepts may be due to the tendency of cost accountants to keep the methods they had developed within their own firms secret."&lt;ref name="GC 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chandra |first1=Gyan | author-link1=  |last2=Paperman |first2=Jacob B. | author-link2= |title=Direct Costing Vs. Absorption Costing: A Historical Review|journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume=3 |issue= 1/4 |pages=1–9 |jstor=40697404|date= 1976 |registration=yes |doi=10.2308/0148-4184.3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The economist [[John Maurice Clark]] is known in the field of accountancy due to his famous ''Studies in the economics of overhead.'' (1909) Source: Mattessich (2007, p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919) specified that most work on cost accounting was written in the last decade, stating that "more than 90% of this literature has been published in the last decade, and fully 75% in the last five years."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Rohrbach [1919, p. 1]; cited in: [[Boyns, Trevor]], and John Richard Edwards. "[http://wvvw.thebhc.org/sites/default/files/beh/BEHprint/v026n2/p0452-p0462.pdf British Cost and Management Accounting Theory and Practice, c. 1850—c. 1950; Resolved and Unresolved Issues]." ''Business and Economic History'' (1997): 452-462.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specific about Nicholson's role Chatfield (2014) noticed, that "Nicholson was less an innovator than a synthesizer. His main contribution was to organize, improve, and propagate this new knowledge as it spread from a tiny minority of pioneering firms to the vast majority of manufacturers who still had no formal cost accounting systems at the beginning of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

=== ''Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs,'' 1909 ===

==== Purpose ====
[[File:Nicholson on Factory Organization and Costs, 1909.jpg|thumb|Title page, 1909.]]
In 1909 Nicholson published his first book, entitled "Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs". In the preview he explained, that this work was primarily intended as a handbook for [[manufacturers]], who are interested in "modern methods of organization and systems"; for [[accountant]]s and cost specialists as a book of reference; and also as a textbook on [[cost accounting]] for the student.&lt;ref name="N 1909 iii"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. iii)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also Nicholson intention to outline and explain all the best known methods of Factory Organization, that relate to Cost Finding in such a manner as to enable the manufacturer to compare these methods with those in use in his own plant, in order that he may see more clearly the defects in his organization and how to remedy them. Nicholson hoped that the Public Accountant, Systematizer, and Cost Clerk would find this work to be of value as a reference in planning, devising, or changing a factory system.&lt;ref name="N 1909 iii"/&gt;

==== Content ====
The work contains forty-eight chapters. Among other important topics "Organization and Cost Finding" forms the subject of one chapter. In this chapter the author summarizes the most important arguments for and against cost systems; he also shows the effect of cost system on organization, independent of cost finding, pointing out clearly the value of system to management. The second important topic dealt with is " Wage Systems." Under this head the author points out the general relation of wage systems to costs, treating of the pay-rate-system, piece work and the differential rate plan, as well as profit-sharing and stock-distribution.

The author then discusses the "Analysis of Cost Accounting," pointing out the fallacy of including selling and administrative expenses in factory costs; also criticisms of incorrect principles in distributing overhead charges. He then deals with the distribution of indirect expenses and explains the old machine rate, new machine rate, fixed machine rate, new pay rate, etc.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee Nicholson | first1 = J | year = 1909 | title = Factory Organization and Costs: Book review | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b640215;view=1up;seq=244| journal = [[Journal of Accountancy]] | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and sixth chapters constitute a general introduction to the subject of forms and systems and discuss such topics as principles used in forms and systems, estimated cost systems, actual cost systems, the designs and explanations relating to the conditions under which forms should be used.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt;

Chapters seven to forty-two contain a large variety of forms (over 200). While undoubtedly a number of these forms or similar ones are to be found in ordinary treatises, nevertheless a good many, if not the majority of them, are original and have evidently been taken from actual experience. The author elucidates and fully explains the use of all the forms given and the advantages that can be derived from them. The forms are in large clear type and well arranged. And finally, the last chapters treat of mechanical office appliances.

==== Analyses of cost accounting ====
In the third chapter Nicholson described, that in his days there was still a significant lack of knowledge on the subject of factory costs. Although the importance and desirability of accurate methods of ascertaining the cost of production is generally conceded, and while much attention has been devoted to this subject, and large sums of money expended annually in perfecting cost keeping records, there is a general lack of knowledge in many instances of the principles involved; and the problem now in hand is to present an analysis of the elements that go to make cost, and to indicate the lines along which methods must be devised to gather and classify the facts that are used in its actual determination. The accuracy and effectiveness with which this is done rests on, (1) the principles involved, and (2) the methods used.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"&gt;Nicholson (1909, 38-42)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson explained, that the elements that comprise the cost in all manufacturing enterprises are made up of three principal divisions:&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
[[File:Elements of Cost, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|Elements of Cost, 1909]]
# ''Material'' : Direct material is that element of material that enters into the product itself and can be charged accurately to the article. Indirect material consists of such material as factory supplies used in the processes, but which do not enter into the product itself. These cannot be charged directly to any one article, but must be distributed over the number of articles affected by their use.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt;  
# ''Labor'' : direct labor is limited to that labor which is actually expended on producing the article manufactured. All forms of labor, such as repairing, hand ling, supervising, etc., that are not engaged directly on the article itself, are desig nated as indirect labor. As in the case of indirect material, the expense of this non-productive labor is distributed over that part of the production that is indirectly affected by it.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
# ''Indirect Expense'' : Indirect expense, together with indirect material and indirect labor, compose the last element of Cost, which is sometimes called "Burden" and sometimes "Overhead "; and this large element of cost must be distributed accurately, by some known ratio, over the production^ if correct costs are to be obtained.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
The elements, that comprise the cost can be graphically depicted (see image). Beside the here three listed principal divisions, it mentions the ''selling and administrative expenses,'' together compromising the total expenses.

==== Forms and systems for control of operations ====
The biggest part of ''Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs,'' is devoted the description of a control system of operations, which relies on a series of forms, and accompanying procedures. Nicholson explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CHAPTERS VII to XXXI, inclusive, are devoted to the explanation and illustration of the various forms which may be introduced in a manufacturing business. The forms shown are in most cases similar to forms that are to-day in successful operation in factory systems that have been devised by the author. These forms have been used in a number of plants manufacturing different products, and it is believed that in their entirety they cover most of the important conditions which will be found to exist in any one plant.&lt;br&gt;This does not mean that these forms are submitted to the business man or accountant as being absolutely orthodox in design and admitting of no change. No one form is adaptable to all lines of manufacture or accounting, and even in the same line of business the same form cannot be used successfully in every instance, as the volume of business, the conditions of manufacture, and the policy of the management, so far as the plan of organization is involved, would make this impracticable...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The forms and designs were to be used in connection with the several systems in the Factory Organization. Nicholson introduced three of these systems in advance as follows: 
[[File:Class of forms used in the system, 1909.jpg|thumb|Classes of forms in the system, 1909]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# ESTIMATED COST SYSTEMS : In order to assist those who, instead of using an actual cost system, estimate their costs and keep their general accounts in the books in such a way as to make it difficult to form any opinion as to the accuracy of these estimates at the end of the year or at any other time, several methods calculated to aid in such case will be found in the chapters on this subject...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 59)&lt;/ref&gt;
# ACTUAL COST SYSTEM : The importance of this subject, while being generally conceded, is nevertheless sadly neglected, and the only explanation that can be given is that either the business man and his assistants are not able to inaugurate such a system, or the expense that might be involved prevents him from taking any action in this direction. This is the only logical explanation that can be offered where the importance of the matter is conceded and admits of no argument or difference of opinion...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 60-61)&lt;/ref&gt;
# STOCK SYSTEM : Although it is not necessary to inaugurate a perpetual inventory in order to obtain costs, yet it is advisable to do so whenever possible, as a safeguard to prevent waste of material, theft, or losses from any other causes; and also to guard against over-buying or failure to carry in stock such materials as are neces sary for the operation of the plant...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The whole series of forms presented in the work is summarized in a single sheet (see image). They are presented in 24 classes, covering operations from purchasing, material handling, stock keeping, [[time book|time tickets]], and production records, to cost records, further accounting operations, to drawing patterns and monthly reports. It showed building blocks of the information architecture.

==== Classification of factory accounts ====
As mentioned in the introduction, Nicholson helped standardize cost accounting practice,"&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt; and contributed to the introduction of [[standard costing]].&lt;ref name="GC 1976"/&gt; A basic building block in this effort is the classification of the accounting practices and factory procedures and reporting. Nicholson kept developing these classifications in his 1909, 1913 and 1919 books. In his 1909 "Factory Organization and Costs" he introduced the classification of the [[general ledger]] and of the operating ledger:

Nicholson (1909) explained, that the first question to be considered in designing a system is the results to be obtained. If the system is to be a complete one, these results will ultimately be shown in the general accounts, which are usually contained in a [[General Ledger]].&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* These accounts should be so classified as to show both the financial status and  earnings of an enterprise. The proper classification and arrangement of these accounts will affect to a great extent the accuracy and clearness of the results to be obtained. 
* It is not necessary in the case of a small enterprise to have an elaborate or extensive classification of accounts. A few will answer all purposes in such cases, providing that the purpose of each account is well defined and charges and credits to these accounts during the year are properly made. 
[[File:Classification of operating departments, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|Classification of operating departments, 1909]]
The accounts, however, must be so kept and arranged as to admit of showing proper results, either at the end of the year or monthly, according to the general plan of the system.&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"/&gt; Additional to the classification of general and operating ledger, Nicholson gave a classification of operating departments (see image).

Nicholson (1909) continued, that in the classification of accounts herein set forth, it will be observed that the assets appear under three principal classifications namely:&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"/&gt; 
* ''Property,''  the fixed assets of the enterprise, and by this term is meant assets that cannot readily be converted into cash.
* ''Deferred Charges'', expenses chargeable to future operations of any nature whatever, such as unexpired insurance, prepaid interest, unusual advertising charges, catalogue expenses, or any other expenses that should not be entirely charged off during any one period but should be pro-rated over several months or fiscal periods. This can be done by charging the original amount to any account properly named under this classification, and by writing off or credit ingto this account the proper proportion each month, charging the amount thus written off to some suitable expense account.  
* ''Current Assets,'' assets of a nature that may be termed quick assets, which can be realized upon currently or from time to time, and are intended to represent the accounts from which funds can be derived to meet current liabilities.

Nicholson (1909) continued to explain the ins and out of Accounts Receivable, the Consignment Account, the Factory Account (inventory of raw material as well as finished stock and goods in process of manufacture), Liabilities, Current Liabilities, Sales, Cost of Sales, etc.&lt;ref name="N 1909 205-7"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 205-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Office appliances ====
About the last sixty pages of his 1909 work, Nicholson devotes to a treatment of mechanical office appliances, giving illustrations of such appliances and explaining fully the use of each one.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt; Nicholson explained that the purpose of chapter was to present information to the manufacturer which may aid him in the organization of his office and in the handling of the immense detail connected with the majority of manufacturing plants. He argued, that "the clerk hire generally necessary in the office of a large plant acts as a dead weight on the profits, and any device which promises to lighten this burden on the cost of production is at least worth careful consideration."&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"&gt;Nicholson (1909, 345-47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson made clear, that the general purpose of mechanical office devices are to lessen the indirect expenses of a factory, and as such clearly within the scope of a book on Factory Costs. The use of these devices would bring four distinct advantages:&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt;
[[File:Time clock, 1909.jpg|thumb|A time clock, one of mechanical office devices introduced in the book.]] 
# They save time in collecting, arranging, and calculating the different items that must be handled in office management: To illustrate this it is only necessary to refer to the function of those time stamps and clocks which register the time of employees on cards in such a way that the computation of the week s pay is only a matter of a short addition and easy multiplication. If wage tables are used even this is dispensed with, as there is then no necessity for the double handling of time records, a feature of the ordinary methods of computing pay rolls. In collecting data for finding costs, the time of beginning and completing operations is usually registered on cards by the workman himself in writing. The use of time stamps in the factory effects a considerable saving of time in this respect alone.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# They obtain greater accuracy with less labor incurred. Calculating machines gain in accuracy by reason of eliminating the personal equation in the operation itself, etc.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# Through their use the clerical force may be reduced, either in actual difference in numbers or in the class of clerks hired:  That is to say that the man agement may often substitute a machine, with a clerk of ordinary intelligence and moderate pay, for the skilled employee whose wages are necessarily high.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# They arrange the work in better form for inspection and use than do the old pen and ink methods. The printed tabular forms and loose sheet devices are surely easier to deal with than cumbersome books and written columns, which have been used from remote times in the accounts of manufacturing firms.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt;

The presentation of these kind of office appliances was more common in management books in those days. Richard T. Dana (1876-1928) and [[Halbert Powers Gillette]] devoted a substantial part of their (1909) ''Construction Cost Keeping and Management'' to the description of numerous office appliances.

==== Reception ====
A 1909 review in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' judged, that the work was the "first American treatise on cost accounting proper, dealing with the subject from an accountant's point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quote cited in Taylor (1979) and Solomons (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The review continues: "The author, though keeping to the front in his treatment of important accounting principles applicable to the subject, has nevertheless written the book in clear and untechnical language... While it may be questioned whether the author has been successful in preparing a text-book for students, he has undoubtedly accomplished his prime object, that of supplying the manufacturer with a thorough treatise on a subject in which he is vitally interested, and that of giving professional accountants and cost specialists a valuable reference work."&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt;

Taylor (1979) recalled, that this 1909 work was the first presentation of a "unified treatment of the estimated cost system." Four years later Nicholson published his second book, ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice,'' which described the "same methods for determining inventories, cost estimates, and analysis of cost of sales but he varied his verification technique."&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt;

=== ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice,'' 1913 ===
[[File:Cost Accounting Theory and Practice, 1913.jpg|thumb|Title page, 1913]]
In 1913 Nicholson published ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice.'' In this work he presented "the same methods for determining inventories, cost estimates, and analysis of cost of sales but he varied his verification technique. This book probably shows the results of his teaching experiences at New York and Columbia Universities. Mr. Nicholson also recommends, in this book, a method for estimating cost of sales at current prices which foreshadowed [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|LIFO]] accounting."&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt; Hein (1959) specified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most remarkable developments in this volume is his distinction between operating departments and service or indirect departments with respect to the allocation of overhead. Another historically important contribution is the integration of the factory accounting with the general financial ledger through the use of reciprocal accounts.&lt;br&gt;But Nicholson went well beyond the treatment of "what are costs" and "how to account for costs." He was deeply interested in factory organization as such, and in the relationship of the cost department with the other departments in a company. The reader can infer this emphasis from the "factory organization" part of the title of his first book. A large part of his consulting practice was devoted to problems of organization and management.&lt;ref name="H 1959 109"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 109)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Hillis Newlove|Newlove]] (1975) mentioned that this work was a very famous textbook, which "devoted four chapters to the allocation of burden costs to the special factory orders or to the product on its productive labor and machine (or process) methods; this emphasis greatly exceeded the space devoted to the collection, analysis and control of burden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Newlove  |first= George Hillis | author-link1= George Hillis Newlove |title=In all my years: Economic and legal causes of changes in accounting |journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume= 2 |issue= 1/4 | date= 1975| pages=40–44 |jstor=40697368 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System of factory accounting ===
[[File:Special order system flow chart, 1913.jpg|thumb|Special order system, 1913 (partly)]]
In the late 1880s [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells|Fells]], had developed a system of factory accounting, and pictured its elements in four complementary flow diagrams. In 1896 [[J. Slater Lewis]] further developed this system, and pictured a diagram of manufacturing accounts, in which the four diagrams were integrated into one whole. A decennium later [[Alexander Hamilton Church]] (1908/10) would further develop this system by introducing the concept of production factors, and picturing the "Principles of Organization by Production Factors" around any organization. Using this concept of production factors Church was able to simplify the system of manufacturing accounts to a "Systems of Controlling Accounts."

In the 1913 ''Cost accounting'' Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach presented not one, but four different method of factory accounting: 
# Special Order System, Productive Labor Method (see image, which only shows some fragments)&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 198)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Special Order System, Process or Machine Method&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 214)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Product System, Productive Labor Method,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 226)&lt;/ref&gt; and 
# Product System, Process or Machine Method.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 236)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach published their work, in 1913/19, [[Edward P. Moxey]] published his influential textbook on accountancy, in which he also pictured the relation of stores records to commercial records.

In his 1922 ''Cost accounts'' [[George Hillis Newlove]] further multiple similar Special Order Systems (see images).&lt;ref&gt;[[George Hillis Newlove]] ''[https://archive.org/stream/costaccounts00newl#page/12/mode/2up Cost accounts].'' 1922. p. 13-21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interest costs ===
[[Gary John Previts|Previts]] (1974) shared Nicholson among the foremost pioneers of [[interest]] costs, with William Morse Cole, John R. Wildman, DR Scott, D. C. Eggleston, Thomas H. Sanders and [[G. Charter Harrison]]. According to Previts "the early arguments over treatment of interest cost (both paid and imputed) spurred publication of countless articles and commentaries along with a relatively sound but since unheralded work Interest as a Cost..."&lt;ref name="GJP 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Previts  |first= Gary John | author-link1= Gary John Previts |title=Old Wine and... The New Harvard Bottle|journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume=1 |issue= 1/4 | date= 1974| pages=19–20 |jstor=40691037 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson explained his point of view in this matter in the 1913 article "Interest Should be Included as Part of the Cost" in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' in which he started the following argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The writer firmly believes in the theory that interest on capital invested should be charged to the proper expense accounts before ascertaining the actual profit from manufacturing or trading.&lt;br&gt;There is a large difference in risk between capital invested in stocks, bonds and real estate and capital invested in manufacturing or other commercial undertakings; and it is not to be disputed that capital invested in commercial enterprises is liable to far greater risk than that of capital invested in securities. It is only fair that the capital invested in commercial enterprises should have credit for at least the same return as that in securities before a trading profit is shown.&lt;br&gt;The two articles in the April number of The Journal by Wm. Morse Cole and [[A. Hamilton Church]] give such logical reasons for the inclusion of interest as a part of the cost...&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Nicholson. "[https://archive.org/stream/journalaccounta04unkngoog#page/n342/mode/2up Interest Should be Included as Part of the Cost]," ''The Journal of Accountancy.'' Vol 15, mr. 2 (May 1913) p. 330-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previts (1974) further explained, that the opposition consisted of a "politically more prominent group, and in the sense of the outcome, the success of their position may have been in large part because of such political strength. As early as 1911, [[Arthur Lowes Dickinson]] criticized advocates of interest inclusion. Dickinson's allies included [[R. H. Montgomery]], Jos. F. Sterrett, and [[George O. May]]."&lt;ref name="GJP 1974"/&gt;

In the 1919 ''Cost Accounting'' Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] again deal with the admittedly controversial question as to whether it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.&amp;nbsp;140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

The opposition view in that time was presented by [[William Andrew Paton]] and Russell Alger Stevenson in their ''Principles of Accounting'' (1919). To these writers, interest charges, whether contractual or non-contractual, are distribution-of-income, not expense, items. But, they say, if these charges are to be made at all, the logical procedure would be to distribute among the factory products the normal return on all the capital invested, not that on the fixed assets only. With this last contention, at least, the reviewer is inclined to agree. But Professors Paton and Stevenson appear to believe that the problem in hand is being solved on other than logical ground. For they say: "The use of interest charges in cost accounts on anything like a rational basis is a procedure which faces almost insurmountable practical obstacles. It is probably this fact rather than the logic of the case that is causing cost accountants to begin to recover from the interest obsession" &lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Paton]] and Russell Alger Stevenson in their ''Principles of Accounting'' (1919), p. 615; Cited in Stanley E. Howard (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniform cost accounting ===
Nicholson has been recognized as a proponent of uniform cost accounting. According to Gerald Berk (1997) Nicholson was part of a group of "associationalists", which promoted the idea that "uniform cost accounting, not enforcement, was the best hope to channel competition away from cut throat pricing into product and manufacturing process improvement."&lt;ref name="GB 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Berk  |first= Gerald | author-link1= |title=Discursive Cartels: Uniform Cost Accounting Among American Manufacturers Before the New Deal |journal= Business and Economic History | volume=26 |issue= 1 | date= 1997| pages=229–251 |jstor=23703309 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These proponents also assumed, that uniform cost accounting would increase factory efficiency. The general idea for manufacturers was, that "the more they would think systematically about 'planning, routing, and scheduling' conversion processes within the firm... the more they [would] understood about the cost of the many products they made, the more they could distinguish the profitable from the unprofitable."&lt;ref name="GB 1997"/&gt; In this context Nicholson had argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a manufacturer can not make money in competition with other concerns when using the same methods of figuring costs, he can only conclude that his goods or his marketing, or both of them, are costing him too much. His next step, naturally, is to analyse closely the methods and conditions under which he is manufacturing and marketing his product, until he finds and corrects the inefficiencies which are handicapping him so seriously...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson cited in U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 1929. p. 12; Cited in Berk (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 1919 "Cost Accounting" Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] expressed the idea, that "if the accuracy of the cost estimate has been tested and the sales price of the product has been properly determined on the basis of the tested cost estimates, then the proper profit margin of the product sold would be assured. The objectives of estimate-cost accounting... were to assure proper profit for the products sold and to test their manufacturing costs in detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okamoto | first1 = Kiyoshi | year = 1966 | title = Evolution of Cost Accounting in the United States of America | url = http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/7628/1/HJcom0040100320.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Hitotsubashi journal of commerce and management | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 32–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Association of Cost Accountants ===
[[File:J. Lee Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920.jpg|thumb|360px|Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920]]
In 1919 Nicholson conceived and organized the National Association of Cost Accountants.&lt;ref&gt;''Management Accounting,'' Vol. 25, Nr. 1 (1943), p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; For a start he had initiated a special meeting of the [[American Institute of Accountants]] to talk about the subject of cost accounting in manufacturing industries. This meeting was held October 13, 1919 in Buffalo, N.Y., and let to the founding of the National Association of Cost Accountants (NACA), forerunner of the [[Institute of Management Accountants]].&lt;ref name="VJ 2014"/&gt;

A total of 37 accountants attended the meeting, and among them were practitioners as William B. Castenholz, Stephen Gilman, Harry Dudley Greeley, and Clinton H. Scovell and professor of accounting [[Edward P. Moxey Jr.]] A total of 97 charter members joined in the initial organization, and among them were [[Arthur E. Andersen]], Eric A. Camman, Frederick H. Hurdman, William M. Lybrand of [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], [[Robert Hiester Montgomery]], C. Oliver Wellington, and John Raymond Wildman.&lt;ref name="VJ 2014"/&gt;

Nicholson was elected its first President 1919-1920. He was succeeded by William M. Lybrand. In the Presidents report in the first Year book of the National Association of Cost Accountants, Nicholson explained, that the Association had started with 88 Chartered members. In the first year an additional 2.000 applications for membership had been received.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Cost Accountants (U.S.). ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008603734 Year book and proceedings of the ... International Cost Conference]. New York : J. J. Little &amp; Ives Co., 1920. p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Costs accounting,'' 1919 ===

==== State of the art of cost accounting ====
[[File:Cost accounting, 1920.jpg|thumb|''Cost accounting,'' 1919/20]]
In the preface of the 1919 ''Cost Accounting'' Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] gave their view on the state of the art of cost accounting in the United States.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cost accounting, as a vital factor of successful business administration, has, in the last few years, been brought home in various ways to many manufacturers who before had never seriously appreciated its importance.&lt;br /&gt;The [[Federal Trade Commission]], working for more stable conditions, has conducted a widespread campaign of education, explaining in detail what a cost accounting system is, how it is operated, and the resulting business advantages.&lt;br /&gt;Various manufacturers' associations have first paid skilled accountants to devise cost-finding methods suited to their special trade conditions, and then have instituted a vigorous propaganda to induce all engaged in their own particular industry to adopt them, thus making these methods uniform in the trade and securing uniformity of selling prices and the end of reckless and ignorant price-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Now the government, with its need to levy war taxes and its consequent necessity for searching investigation into income and excess profits, requires that estimates and approximations as to production costs and profits shall give place to rational accounting systems giving actual figures by uniform methods.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1920, p. iii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the important aims of the book is to "classify the details of cost accounting so that the reader, be he accountant, manufacturer, or student, is given a well-defined idea of the forms and records required for each separate operation."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919, p. iv) as cited in Burnet (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Content of ''Costs accounting'', 1919====
Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]]'s ''Cost Accounting'' is a revision and extension of Nicholson's "Cost Accounting, Theory and Practice," published in 1913, and represents a forward step in its particular field. There are seven distinct parts of the book, and the last preceding statement applies particularly to the first four parts, designated as follows:&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"&gt;Stanley E. Howard. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804685 Review of Cost Accounting. By J. Lee Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach]]. New York: The Ronald Press Company. 1919.]" in: ''The American Economic Review,'' Vol. 9, No. 3 (Sep., 1919), pp. 563-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I, Elements and Methods of Cost-Finding ; 
* Part II, Factory Routine and Detailed Reports ; 
* Part III, Compiling and Summarizing the Cost Records ; 
* Part IV, Controlling the Cost Records. 
The following three parts are:
* Part V, The Installation of a Cost System, is both descriptive and suggestive. 
* Part VI, Simplified Cost Finding Methods, is again chiefly descriptive.
* Part VII, Cost-Pius Contracts, is analytical and suggestive, and contains that which will be regarded by many as the most valuable material in the volume. Chapters 31 and 32 contain the senior author's personal, not official, opinions concerning the correct accounting procedure in the handling of cost-plus contracts. In chapter 33, likewise, are found his personal opinions regarding the proper terms of cancellation of such contracts. These chapters are most timely and will be read with interest by professional accountants and contractors.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

==== General Functions of Cost Accounting ====
According to Nicholson (1920) it would be a mistake, to think that the scope of [[cost accounting]] is limited to finding costs only. The functions of a cost system are as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any good cost system, properly operated, performs two distinct, though related, functions.
* The first, which may be called the direct function, is that of ascertaining actual costs. 
* The second, or indirect function, is that of supplying, in its system of reports, the information necessary to organize the many departments of a factory into working units, and to direct their activities in accord with some definite plan.&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"&gt;Nicholson (1920, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the relation of cost accounting and general accounting Nicholson (1920) proceeded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cost accounting, as a science, is a branch of general [[accounting]]. Its province is to analyze and record the cost of the various items of material, labor and indirect expense incurred in the operation of a factory, and to so compile these elements as to show the total production cost of a particular piece of work.&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore: "With the cost books once established, the best modem usage is to incorporate their record in total in the general financial books. In this way the modem cost system builds up an interlocking series of accounts which furnish the material for a detailed study of the operations of a manufacturing business."&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"/&gt;

==== Elements and Methods of Cost-Finding ====
In his 1909 "Factory Organization and Costs" Nicholson already presented a first analyses regarding the relation of the cost elements to selling price, which was visualized in a diagram (see above).  In his 1919 work he explained that this analyses can be part of a "uniform methods of cost-finding." This means outlining the standard principles of cost accounting and, from these principles, arriving at uniform  methods of treating costs as applied to a particular industry.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 11-12"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 11-12)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson explained that the greatest advantage to be derived from uniform cost methods is that of insuring a more uniform selling price. This object would be attained, even if the uniform system were not as scientific as it should be; for if errors were made through the method established, all manufacturers would at least be figuring the same way, all would be making the same mistakes, and unfair and ignorant competition would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 11-12"/&gt; Before determining the selling price of an article consideration must be given to the various elements of costs and expenses which have been classified as:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 19-23)&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Direct material 
# Direct labor 
# Direct expenses 
# Indirect charges 
# Selling expenses 
# Administrative expenses 
The standard cost accounting system recognized not only expenses, but also different types of costs, and eventually the selling price:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"/&gt; 
* ''Prime Cost.'' The sum of the direct material cost plus the direct labor cost is known as the prime cost. 
* ''Factory Cost.'' The sum of the prime cost plus the indirect charges is known as the factory cost. 
* ''Total Cost.'' The sum of the factory cost plus the selling expenses and the administrative expenses is known as the total cost. 
* ''Selling Price''. The sum of the total cost plus the profit is known as the selling price.

These gradations of cost may be further illustrated by means of the following simple diagram (diagram I), which illustrates the steps leading from the material cost to the selling price. This diagram is an extension of the analyses of cost accounting, Nicholson presented in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; This type of visual analytics was presented earlier by [[Alexander Hamilton Church|Church]] (1901),&lt;ref&gt;[[Church, Alexander Hamilton]], "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101049911280;view=1up;seq=532 The Proper Distribution of Establishment Charges]." in Engineering Magazine, July to Dec. 1901. p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; and became more common in introductory textbooks; see for example Webner (1911),&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank E. Webner]]. ''[https://archive.org/stream/factorycostsawo00webngoog#page/n280/mode/2up Factory costs, a work of reference for cost accountants and factory managers].'' 1911. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dexter S.

Nicholson continued, that in practice it is customary to allow certain deductions from the established selling prices, or from the established purchasing prices. These deductions can include trade discounts, allowances, rebates and/or cash discount.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"/&gt; As to the analysis of total of cost elements, every cost element can be traced back to certain kind of expenses, see diagram II. This kind of diagram was also more common in those days; see for example [[Halbert Powers Gillette#Fundamental Divisions of Cost|Dana &amp; Gillette]] (1909),&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillette, Halbert Powers]], and Richard T. Dana. ''[https://archive.org/stream/costkeepingmanag00gilluoft#page/128/mode/2up Construction Cost Keeping and Management].'' Gillette Publishing Company, 1909. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dexter S.

==== Basic methods of cost-finding ====
As costs furnish the basis for determining the selling prices of the manufactured product, they naturally should be compiled so that the total cost of the job, order, or article may be readily ascertained. Actual conditions in manufacturing determine the system of cost-finding to be used, which should include :&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 25-34)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# A method of ascertaining or reporting the material, labor, and overhead costs. 
# A method of compiling these elements of cost. 
# A method of determining the total cost of the job, order, or article. 
For present purposes the actual conditions which exist in manufacturing industries may be grouped or summarized in two general classes, and the methods of cost-finding applicable to these two classes may be designated as follows:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
[[File:Chart Showing Methods of Cost-Finding Applied to Various Industries, 1919.jpg|thumb|420px|III: Methods of Cost-Finding Applied to Various Industries, 1919]]
* '''Order method of cost-finding''' : When the order is the tangible basis upon which the elements of cost are charged, compiled, and determined, the order method of cost-finding is generally used. In other words, under such conditions the material costs, labor costs, and a pro rata share of the factory overhead are all charged to definite factory orders, and the elements of material, labor, and overhead costs are compiled so that the total factory cost of each individual order may be determined. If a number of units are manufactured under the definite factory order, the unit article cost may be determined by dividing the total factory cost by the total quantity manufactured or produced. Definite factory orders may be issued for the manufacture of a number of units, for a single unit, or for the manufacture of certain parts of a unit.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
* '''Process method of cost-finding''' : Whenever the process of manufacture is continuous for regular periods of time so that the definite factory orders and jobs lose their identity and become part of a large volume of production, the material, labor, and overhead costs are chargeable to the definite processes or operations and the process method of cost-finding is used. This method is sometimes called the "product method of cost-finding." However, in view of the fact that the word *' product" refers more particularly to article rather than operation, the designation "process method of cost-finding" is more explicit and is preferable. This term includes the method commonly known as the "machine-cost method," for the reason that the same general principles of cost-finding apply.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
 
Form III shows in summarized form the two basic methods of cost-finding and the industries, or departments within a plant, to which they are applicable under the conditions already described.

==== Factory Routine and Detailed Reports ====
Before it can be decided which method of cost-finding may be used in any particular plant, the manufacturing departments of the plant must be classified. In some industries the order method of cost-finding might be applicable to certain departments, and the process method of cost-finding might be applicable to the remaining departments (see diagram IV).&lt;ref name="NR 1919 35-57"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 35-57)&lt;/ref&gt;

In designing the system of "Factory Routine and Detailed Reports" first a classification is presented of factory departments and of factory orders. Diagram 4 shows the classification of various factory departments in summarized form.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagram V summarizes the various kinds of factory orders which may be issued and the functions of these records.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the system of "Factory Routine and Detailed Reports," proposed by Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919), incorporates three types of reports about the handling of material, labor and production:

Diagram VI shows the various steps in the handling of material, and the material reports which are necessary to record 
material costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagram VII summarizes the various kinds of labor reports and the routine of reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;  And diagram VIII summarizes the detailed items to be considered in the routine of production and the devising of production reports.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 209)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distribution of Factory Overhead ====
At the turn of the 20th century, factory management was faced with the problem how overhead cost should be assigned to products, which lead to the modelling of costing systems. In the work of Nicholson the idea of [[cost centres]] was emphasizing, although he didn't coined or used the term itself. An accompanying problem was "how to distinguish between 'production' cost centres working directly for production and 'service provider' cost centres working for other centres... [to] cascade the distribution of the charges related to these cost centres."&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"&gt;Levant, Yves, and Henri Zimnovitch. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yves_Levant/publication/228925061_Equivalence_methods_a_little-known_aspect_of_the_history_of_costing/links/0046353a1b54f372e2000000.pdf Equivalence methods: a little-known aspect of the history of costing]." at ''researchgate.net.'' Accessed 2015-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel Paul Garner|Garner]] (1954) Nicholson in (1913) as well as to Webner (1917) and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor]], where the first to tackle this problem.&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"/&gt;

Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919) further summarized, that the factory overhead that cannot be absorbed in the article cost directly is applied indirectly in the following manner:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 163-182)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The elements of factory overhead cost are assigned equitably to specific departments of the factory, including productive, non-productive, and miscellaneous departments. 
# The total cost of the indirect departments is then transferred to, and distributed over, the productive departments on some fair basis. 
# The total amount of factory overhead expenses chargeable to each productive department is determined, and is then distributed over the various jobs, orders, articles, or processes.

Nicholson continued explaining about different methods of distributing overhead. Assuming the departmental method of distributing overhead has been adopted, he said, there still remains the most complex problem of all - upon what basis shall the overhead be distributed within the departments so that each job, order, or article may be charged with the portion that properly belongs to it? In those days five methods were more or less standard, applied under definite conditions of manufacture. These are:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"/&gt;
[[File:Classification Chart of Factory Overhead, 1919.jpg|thumb|420px|IX. Classification Chart of Factory Overhead, 1919]]
# ''Prime-cost method'' : the most simple method, which divides the total overhead expenses by the total material and labor costs, resulting in a decimal figure which is the rate to be used. 
# ''Productive-labor-cost method'' : based upon the principle that indirect expenses are incurred in proportion to the cost of the labor involved. To operate the plan, the total amount of overhead expenses for a definite period is divided by the total cost of the direct labor for the same period.
# ''Productive-labor-hours method'' : similar as the productive-labor-cost method, but the amount of labor is measured by time and not by cost.
# ''Machine-rate methods'' : All machine-rate methods are based upon the principle that overhead expense accrues in proportion to the number of hours of machine operation.
# ''Miscellaneous methods'' : Various modifications and combinations of methods for the distribution of overhead have been devised to meet special conditions in different lines of business. For the most part they are "percentage" plans in some form or other.
The items which make up the factory overhead and the methods of distributing them first to departments and then to product are summarized in diagram IX.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"/&gt;

==== Compiling and Summarizing the Cost Records ====
Further classification of cost accounting details have been made as follows:

}}

Diagram X summarizes the information entered on different kinds of cost sheets and the method of posting and checking the data they contain,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 230)&lt;/ref&gt; and diagram XI shows in concrete form the cost summarizing records described all of Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919). The authors noted, that the distribution record, may be used for all summary purposes. The 
sheets of each summary may be classified in sections in a loose-leaf binder, each section being kept separate by means of tab 
indexes, thus providing a means for ready reference. The folios of each section should be numbered for posting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 292)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlling the Cost Records ====
In the chapter about "General Ledger Control of Factory Accounts," Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach explained that in large manufacturing concerns it is customary to provide a chart or a classified list of accounts showing the exact name of each and the transactions to be recorded therein. Where the classification is elaborate, it is well to use account numbers or symbols so as to facilitate ready reference to them and thus save the bookkeepers' time. The authors advise, that such a chart should be printed upon heavy paper or cardboard and hung in view of those who have occasion to refer to it frequently. Where desks are equipped with glass tops and the chart is inserted under the glass, reference can be made to it very readily.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 310-314)&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of each concern govern the number of copies of the chart of accounts to be prepared and the members of the staff to whom they are to be given. Ordinarily it is necessary for each clerk in the accounting and cost departments to have his own copy, while an additional copy should be given to the purchasing agent and treasurer or the officer who is in charge of the accounting records. Portions of the chart of accounts may be given to the plant superintendent, production manager, factory foreman, stock clerks, and factory clerks.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"/&gt;

The chart shown in diagram XII gives a classified list of accounts of a large manufacturing concern. Last part of the system presented are the scheme's concerning the controlling the cost records:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"/&gt;

Diagram XIII summarizes the discussion of the factory ledger accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason that it is advantageous to draw up a classification sheet of the general ledger accounts of a large manufacturing plant, the factory ledger accounts may also be illustrated by means of a chart (diagram XIV). In preparing such a chart, the accounts should be given symbol numbers. It may be noted that factory ledger controlling accounts vary in number from the three simple accounts previously described to several hundred.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 331-332"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 331-332)&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrangement of the accounts in the ledger should receive attention. While they are often arranged according to their symbol numbers, as their classification is more or less standardized according to Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919), they may be grouped in sections in the following order: 
# Raw material accounts 
# Work in process accounts 
# Part-finished stock accounts 
# Finished stock accounts 
# Productive labor accounts 
# Distributed overhead accounts 
# Detailed factory overhead accounts 
The sections should be distinguished by means of tab indexes marked according to the classifications. Where detailed overhead accounts are kept for each department, it may be well to furnish additional tab indexes within this section marked with the departments of the plant so that the overhead accounts of one department may be readily distinguished from those of another.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 331-332"/&gt; With these [[classification chart]]s Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919) presented their idea's, which became known as the definition of [[cost centres]].&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"/&gt;

==== Reception ====
In a 1919 review in ''The American Economic Review,'' Stanley E. Howard stated, that the materials of the volume are well organized. The reader is given a bird's eye view of the problems dealt with, and is then shown in detail the development of cost and controlling records from the various business and factory forms. The authors have taken pains to emphasize relationships, presenting frequent summary charts. Fundamentals regarding the forms for orders, reports, and records have been illustrated, and the mistake has not been made of confounding multiplicity of illustration with clarity of exposition.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

The volume is intended for use by accountants, manufacturers, and students. Members of the first two groups, according to Howard (1919), would find particularly useful the information contained in the tables of approved depreciation rates for different types of assets, as well as the discussion of the relationship between Overtime and the modification of standard depreciation rates.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

Howard (1919) ended his review by stating, that the issue is probably beclouded by reason of the different points of view involved. The cost accountant wishes, among other things, to furnish the selling department adequate data upon which to base a price policy. The general accountant has in mind the preparation of correct, unpadded statements of condition and of operation. For the purposes of the one certain information is needed, which by the other should be discarded. Reconciliation of the opposing ideas ought to be possible, perhaps along the lines suggested by Messrs. Nicholson and Rohrbach.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

A second 1919 review by Arthur R. Burnet in the ''Publications of the American Statistical Association'' called the entire work a happy combination of theory and practical examples. Burnet found that the book is being used as a handbook in a number of organizations where cost systems were being installed or improved. The forms are illustrated and can be followed in actual practice. The chapter on the examination of the plant preparatory to the installation of a cost system, according to Burnet in those days, contained a valuable checking list which should furnish statisticians with a wealth of suggestions for the analysis of business.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Burnet. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2964891 Reviewed Work: Cost Accounting by J. Lee Nicholson, John F. D. Rohrbach," in: ''Publications of the American Statistical Association,'' Vol. 16, No. 126 (Jun., 1919), pp. 405-406.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1920 review, in the ''Financial World,'' more in particular mentioned,  that "in the methods of manufacture, greater care must be exercised. The functions of a cost system are well stated by Major J. Lee Nicholson..." in his 1919 work.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial World,'' Vol 32, Part 2, (1919-20) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Profitable Management,'' 1923 ===
Nicholson last book was ''Profitable Management,'' published in 1923. A 1923 review in ''The Annalist'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The volume on "Profitable Management" by J. Lee Nicholson 's a bright star in the Ronald catalogue, and in its 117 pages it presents a vast array of worldly wisdom which should be taken to heart by men of business, great and small.  For while the major part of Mr. Nicholson's counsels on the varied phases of commercial activity have reference to the more extensive industries, they are applicable to every kind of business which is called into existence for profit making...&lt;ref&gt;''The Annalist: A Magazine of Finance, Commerce and Economics,'' New York Times Company. Vol. 22 (1923) p. 705&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hein (1959) further evaluated, that "modern writers on management theory and practice would have to examine it closely to find points not now being advocated in the current literature. It contains such recommendations as the costing of clerical and selling procedures, and the setting of standards as a means for comparison and control. Even today such procedures have not been widely adopted, although, since clerical costs are increasing at a faster rate than are factory costs, such control has much greater significance at the present time than it had in the early 1920s." &lt;ref name="H 1959 107"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Nicholson reputation as cost accounting pioneer was acknowledged in his days. A 1920 article in ''The Packages,''  mentioned that "Major J. Lee Nicholson... reputation as a cost accountant and author extends from one end of the country to the other..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Packages,'' Vol. 23. (1920). p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson is further remembered as founder of the National Association of Cost Accountants.&lt;ref name="McL 1924"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Cost Accountants (U.S.) . ''Official Publications.'' Vol. 7.  (1964). p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Evolution of Cost Accounting to 1925'' [[Samuel Paul Garner|S. Paul Garner]] (1954) &lt;ref&gt;[[Garner, S. Paul]], ''Evolution of Cost Accounting to 1925,'' University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; described a number of important contributions by Nicholson. Hein (1959) summarized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, [Nicholson] proposed a summary of requisitions as an aid in posting to stores ledgers and cost records. In this same area of accounting for raw materials, Nicholson was an exponent of the use of a true perpetual inventory system. He did not originate this idea, but brought it to a high stage of perfection, designing raw materials ledger cards which had spaces not only for amounts and values, but also for items received and requisitioned, with the balance on hand indicated."&lt;ref&gt;Hein (1959, p. 108-9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hein (1959) further summarized:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Garner credits Nicholson with the original development of the several methods of accounting for scrap (although some earlier pioneering work had been done in this area), and he feels that the works of subsequent writers are primarily elaborations of Nicholson's treatment. In the differentiation of the uses of, and the accounting for job order costing and process costing, Nicholson was especially farsighted, missing only the now-taken-for granted concept of equivalent production in the valuation of inventories and the calculation of the cost of goods sold. He was apparently the first individual to develop the concepts and comparative advantages of accounting for costs departmentally, on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis that is, pyramided and non-pyramided departmental costs.&lt;ref name="H 1959 109"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Chatfield (2014) Nicholson's later writings "anticipated post-1920 developments in the use of cost figures for decision making and in the psychology of cost control."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt; He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Nicholson's] experiences as head of a management consulting firm focused his attention on the relationship between [[cost accounting]] and [[industrial efficiency]]. He emphasized that cost accounting is a service function whose value depends on its usefulness to other departments. As a staff man negotiating with foremen and executives, the cost accountant must be diplomatic, yet forceful enough to take full advantage of the discipline that costing makes possible. Nicholson stressed the importance of supplying cost figures that are appropriate for each executive level, and the need to educate foremen and department heads about overhead costs as a first step toward controlling such costs. Cost accountants should give department managers comparative costs of materials, labor, overhead, production quantities, and inventories. Each production department should in turn inform the sales department how all these amounts are likely to vary in relation to changes in sales volume.&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore Nicholson "refined and disseminated new knowledge about cost accounting, which had recently undergone revolutionary changes... As one of the earliest American cost accountants to teach the subject at the university level, he helped standardize practice and facilitate the interaction of ideas between academics and practitioners."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

{{Companies law}}
A '''limited partnership''' ('''LP''') is a form of [[partnership]] similar to a [[general partnership]] except that while a general partnership must have at least two general partners (GPs), a limited partnership must have at least one GP and at least one limited partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. |last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| year = 2003| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458| pages = 190| isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPs are, in all major respects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm: they have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have [[joint and several liability]] for the [[debt]]s of the partnership.

As in a general partnership, the GPs have actual authority, as [[agency law|agents]] of the firm, to bind the partnership in [[contract]]s with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. As with a general partnership, "an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners."&lt;ref&gt;United States [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] § 402(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of limited liability==
Like [[shareholder]]s in a [[corporation]], limited partners have [[limited liability]]. This means that the limited partners have no management authority, and (unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guarantee) are not liable for the debts of the partnership. The limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment (similar to a [[dividend]]), the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement. General Partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners, and in cases of financial loss, the GPs will be the ones which are personally liable.

Limited partners are subject to the same alter-ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the partnership and the members do not co-mingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce the veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/piercing-the-corporate-veil/ |title=What is "Piercing the Corporate Veil" |last= |first= |publisher= |date=21 May 2015 |website=Law 4 Small Business |access-date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnership interests (including the interests of limited partners) are afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor’s share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

When the partnership is being constituted, or the composition of the firm is changing, limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] registration office. Limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties, so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability. It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent [[Agency (law)|agency]] authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently ''held out'' as agents (and so create an agency by [[estoppel]]); or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority.

Limited partnerships are distinct from [[limited liability partnership]]s, in which all partners have limited liability. In some jurisdictions, the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management.

==History==
The ''societates publicanorum'', which arose in [[Rome]] in the third century BC, may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership. During the heyday of the [[Roman Empire]], they were roughly equivalent to today's [[corporation]]s. Some had many investors, and interests were publicly tradable. However, they required at least one (and often several) partners with unlimited liability.&lt;ref name=Malmendier&gt;Malmendier, Ulrike; ''Societas publicanorum: staatliche Wirtschaftsaktivitäten in den Händen privater Unternehmer ''; Böhlau Verlag; Cologne, FRG;  2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept's roots===
According to Jairus Banaji, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''[[Mudaraba]]'' institutions in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic economic jurisprudence|economic jurisprudence]] were similar to the modern limited partnership. In medieval [[Italy]], a business organization known as the ''commenda'' appeared in the 10th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade. In a commenda, the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability, and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract. In contrast, his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk. A ''commenda'' was not a common form for a long-term business venture as most long-term businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml ''Law and the Rise of the Firm''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224214019/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/march06/hansmann_kraakman_squire.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; 119; Harvard Library; Rev.; Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, and Richard Squire; p. 1333; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As an institution, the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Robert H.; ''Limited Liability in Historical Perspective'', "Washington and Lee Law Review," Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colbert's Ordinance]] (1673) and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1807) reinforced the limited partnership concept in European law. In the [[United States]], limited partnerships became widely available in the early 19th century, although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures. Britain enacted its first limited partnership statute in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml ''Entity Shielding and the Development of Business Forms: A Comparative Perspective''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224190251/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/forum/issues/119/march06/lamoreaux_rosenthal.shtml |date=2007-02-24 }}; p. 119; Harvard Library; Rev. F.; Lamoreaux, Naomi R. and Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent; p. 238 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
:''For a list of types of corporation and other business types by country, see [[Types of business entity]].''

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the limited partnership organization is most common among [[film industry|film production companies]] and real estate investment projects, or in types of businesses that focus on a single or limited-term project. They are also useful in "[[manual labour|labor]]-[[Capital (economics)|capital]]" partnerships, where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work. In such situations, liability is the driving concern behind the choice of limited partnership status. The limited partnership is also attractive to firms wishing to provide shares to many individuals without the additional tax liability of a corporation. [[Private equity]] companies almost exclusively use a combination of general and limited partners for their investment funds. Well-known limited partnerships include [[Enterprise Products]] and [[Blackstone Group]] (both of which are [[Public company|public companies]]), and [[Bloomberg L.P.]] (a [[private company]]).

Before 2001, the limited liability enjoyed by limited partners was contingent upon their refraining from taking any active role in the management of the firm. However, Section 303 of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (if adopted by a state legislature) eliminates the so-called "control rule" with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings limited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.

The 2001 amendments to the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]] (to the extent the amendments are adopted by state legislature) also permitted limited partnerships to become [[Limited Liability Limited Partnership]]s in states that adopt the change. Under this form, debts of a limited liability limited partnership are solely the responsibility of the partnership, thereby removing general-partner liability for partnership obligations. This change was made in response to the common practice of naming a limited-liability entity as a 1% general partner that controlled the limited partnership and organizing the managers as limited partners. This practice granted a general partner de facto limited liability under the partnership structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on this practice and background on the modification of GP liability, see Thomas E. Geau &amp; Barry B. Nekritz, ''Expectations for the Twenty-First Century:  An Overview of the New Limited Partnership Act'', 16 Probate &amp; Property 47, 48-49 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], limited partnerships are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. The UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]]) consulted in 2008 on proposals to modify and merge the Act with the Partnership Act 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |title=The Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009: Explanatory Document |publisher=UK Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform |date=June 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135622/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51586.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the proposals did not go ahead, and the 1907 Act remains the governing Act.

[[English law]] and [[Scottish law]] are distinct on partnerships. In English law, limited partnerships are not legally separate entities: the partners are jointly and severally liable and any lawsuits filed are filed against the partners by name. There has been discussion over whether limited partnerships operating under English law should be made separate legal entities in the same way as limited liability partnerships are. The [[Law Commission]] report on partnership law [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613041633/http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc283.pdf LC283] suggested that creation of separate legal personality should be left as an option for the partners to decide upon when a partnership is formed. There were concerns that automatically making partnerships separate legal entities would restrict their ability to trade in some European countries and also expose them to different tax regimes than expected.

===Japan===
[[Japanese law]] has historically provided for two business forms similar to limited partnerships:
* ''[[Goshi gaisha]]'', a form of close [[corporation]] (''[[mochibun kaisha]]'') with unlimited liability for certain shareholders
* ''[[Tokumei kumiai]]'' (lit. "anonymous partnerships"), a form of partnership in which non-operating partners have limited liability so long as they remain anonymous

In 1999, the [[Diet of Japan]] passed legislation enabling the formation of {{Nihongo|"limited partnerships for investment"|投資事業有限責任組合|''tōshi jigyō yūgen sekinin kumiai''}}. These are very similar to Anglo-American limited partnerships, in that they adopt most provisions of [[general partnership]] law but provide for limited liability for certain partners. Profits of an investment limited partnership pass through to all partners proportional to their investment share. For tax purposes, profits and losses will only pass through to the general partner(s) while the partnership has [[negative equity]] (i.e. liabilities exceeding assets); however, profits and losses while the partnership has positive equity are shared equally.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], Limited Partnerships are a form of partnership involving General Partners, (who are liable for all the debts and liabilities of the partnership) and Limited Partners (who are liable to the extent of their capital contribution to the partnership). The Limited Partnerships Act 2008 replaces Special Partnerships that exist under Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908. Special partnerships are considered obsolete as they do not provide the appropriate structure preferred by foreign venture capital investors.

Features of Limited Partnerships include:
* a list of activities that the limited partners can be involved in while not participating in the management of the Limited Partnership (safe harbour activities)
* an indefinite lifespan if desired
* separate legal personality
* tax treatment for Limited Partnerships.

The registers of Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are administered by the New Zealand [[Companies Office]]. Registration, maintenance and annual return filing for Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are conducted through manual forms.

===Germany===
'''Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien''' – abbreviated '''KGaA''' – is a [[Germany|German]] [[corporation|corporate]] designation standing for 'partnership limited by shares', a form of corporate organization roughly equivalent to a [[master limited partnership]]. A [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] auf Aktien has two types of participators. It has at least one partner with unlimited liability (Komplementär). It is in that sense a private company. Komplementärs are [[natural person]]s or [[legal person]]s. If the Komplementär is a corporation with limited liability then the type of the company has to be named as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung#Requirements of formation|UG (haftungsbeschränkt)]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[GmbH]] &amp; Co. KGaA'', ''[[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] &amp; Co. KGaA'' or ''[[Societas_Europaea|SE]] &amp; Co. KGaA''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sas.ac.uk/amicus/article/view/1229 The German Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien]. Amicus Curae. Accessed April 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Under consideration of the aspects of European freedom of establishment it is also possible that corporations established under foreign law can become Komplementärs of a KGaA forming companies like ''Limited &amp; Co. KGaA''.

The investment of the [[Partnership|partners]] with [[limited liability]] (Kommanditisten) is the stock of the company (Grundkapital) and divided into shares. A KGaA is in that aspect comparable with a German [[Aktiengesellschaft]].

The investment of all partners is the corporate's total capital (Gesamtkapital). The KGaA is a traditional type of very large [[family business]]es (that are partly publicly traded) in Germany; the consumer products giant [[Henkel]] and pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] are prominent examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5885211 |title=Company Overview of DORMA Holding GmbH + Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Merck, besides the owning family Merck also the members of the executive board are fully and privately liable for the company (including a period after withdrawal). Also the German football club [[Borussia Dortmund]] uses this corporate organization for its professional football team.

===Denmark===
A [[kommanditselskab]] (abbreviated K/S) is the Danish equivalent of the limited partnership. The owners are divided into general partners (komplementarer in Danish) and limited partners (kommanditister in Danish). Often the only general partner of a K/S is an Anpartsselskab with the least possible capital, thus reducing the liability of the K/S to the capital of the Anpartsselskab.

'''''Microsoft Corp. v. Shah''''' was an 
[[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA) case heard before the 
[[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. [[Microsoft]] sued the [[defendant]]s, Amish Shah and others, for, among other charges, ''contributory cybersquatting'' for encouraging others, through videos and software, to infringe on Microsoft's [[trademark]]s. The case was settled out of court in July 2011 after judge [[Ricardo S. Martinez]] denied Shah's motion for dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Background== 
Amish Shah, with help from the other defendants, registered [[domain name]]s containing Microsoft trademarks, and induced others to register similar domains. Some of these domains used possible misspellings of trademarked Microsoft names.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby Jones, "[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/01/14/on-microsoft-and-contributory-cybersquatting/ On Microsoft and ‘Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Wall Street Journal'' Law Blog, 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumers seeking Microsoft products could mistakenly end up at the defendants' website and be tricked into downloading the defendants' products. In addition to [[cybersquatting]], the defendants also produced instructions (including a video) on how to use Microsoft's marks in a misleading manner to maximize traffic to the website. Shah also offered a software system that enabled buyers to easily create websites incorporating Microsoft's marks.

On the basis of the latter, Microsoft made claims for ''contributory cybersquatting'' and contributory [[trademark dilution]], in addition to cybersquatting, trademark dilution, and [[trademark infringement]]. Defendants moved to dismiss the claims for contributory cybersquatting and contributory dilution, arguing that such causes of action are not recognized under law. The ACPA created liability only for registering, trafficking, or using a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark. Additionally, the ACPA required proof that the defendant acted with "bad faith with intent to profit from the mark."&lt;ref name="acpa-bad-faith"&gt;{{USCSub|15|1125|d|1|A|i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court== 

Judge Ricardo Martinez decided against dismissal on January 12, 2011, affirming that Microsoft had a possible case against Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

&lt;/ref&gt; The court first noted that while contributory trademark infringement is well established, the ACPA, unlike trademark law, required a showing of "bad faith intent."{{source needed|date=February 2015}} Previous courts, notably in ''[[Ford Motor Co. v.

&lt;/ref&gt; reasoned that a higher standard was required for claims of contributory cybersquatting.

The court noted that the decision of the Ford court indicated that the court had recognized a cause of action under contributory cybersquatting, but found in favor of GreatDomains.com since Ford failed to show the requisite bad faith by GreatDomains.com.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} The Judge noted that in this particular case, the facts clearly demonstrated bad faith with an intent to profit, and as such denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} While the ACPA does not explicitly address causes of action under [[contributory liability]], the court noted that action under the ACPA is a [[tort]]-like cause of action, and traditional principles of [[tort law]] impose [[legal liability|liability]] on those who assist or contribute in the infringement.{{source needed|date=December 2014}}

==Impact== 

The court's decision notably expanded liability under the ACPA to include contributory damages, basing its decision on traditional principles of liability of tort law. Several scholars noted that the court's decision provides a precedent for expanding ACPA liability, beyond actions explicitly prohibited by the text of the law.&lt;ref name="jolt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; This was particularly notable since Microsoft did not have to prove that the defendant actually sold any domain names to third parties or helped third parties acquire domain names.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;

An attempt was made in 2009 to sue [[GoDaddy]], a [[domain registrar]], under a different charge of "contributory cybersquatting". In this case, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District Court of California]] ruled in favor of GoDaddy in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tigerintellectual.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/godaddy-in-suit-for-cybersquatting-contributory-cybersquatting/ Godaddy In Suit For Cybersquatting &amp; Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Tiger Intellectual'', 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Braman began his career as a market research analyst for [[Seagram|Seagram's Distributors]] in 1955.  A few years later he took an executive position at Bargaintown U.S.A. which he eventually acquired and turned into Keystone Stores, a chain of self-service variety stores in the Philadelphia area.  In the mid-1960s he spearheaded the merger between his Keystone Stores business and Philadelphia Laboratories to create Philadelphia Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics.  Braman was appointed president and CEO of the new company.  Acquisitions under his tenure at the company included Vitamix Pharmaceuticals, F.A. Martin and Company, and U.S. Cocoa Corporation.  Braman stepped down from his position at Philadelphia Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics in 1969 to pursue other interests.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaldealer.com/interview-with-norman-braman-owner-of-braman-enterprises |title=Interview with Norman Braman – Owner of Braman Enterprises|publisher=Emerald Expositions|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bugatti Veyron @ Braman Motors, Miami FL - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A Bugatti Veyron sits in the showroom at one of Braman’s Miami dealerships]]
Braman got his start in the automobile business in 1972 when he acquired controlling interest of Sharpe-Taylor Cadillac in [[Tampa, Florida]].  During these early years, Braman was mentored by well known car dealer and fellow Philadelphia native [[Victor Potamkin]].  In 1975, Braman bought the former Nolan Brown Cadillac in [[Miami, Florida]].  The following year, Braman took on his first import brands with the purchase of [[BMW]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] dealership C.R. Berry Motors and moved both franchises next to his Miami [[Cadillac]] dealership.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  By 1980, Braman had Cadillac, BMW, Rolls-Royce, [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]], [[Lancia]], and [[Toyota]] dealerships along the 2000 block of [[Biscayne Boulevard]] in Miami.  

While continuing to expand his dealership holdings in the [[South Florida]] area, Braman has also added dealerships in [[Colorado]].  Today, Braman serves as chairman of Braman Management, an umbrella company for his automotive businesses that include more than 20 dealerships in [[Florida]] and Colorado selling [[Acura]], [[Audi]], [[Bentley]], BMW, [[Bugatti]], Cadillac, [[Genesis Motors|Genesis]], [[Honda]], [[Hyundai]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], [[Porsche]] and Rolls-Royce.&lt;ref name="bizjournals"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Gale|title=JM Family Enterprises, Southern Wine &amp; Spirits lead the list|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2004/08/02/focus1.html|work=South Florida Business Journal|date=August 2, 2004|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his retail automotive businesses, Braman had majority ownership of Austin Rover Cars of North America (ARCONA), the distributorship for [[Sterling (marque)|Sterling]] automobiles imported to the United States starting in 1987.  The company's name was changed to Sterling Motor Cars in 1989 and closed in 1991 after sales of the [[Rover 800 Series|Rover 800]]-based Sterling 825/827 models failed to meet expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2014/03/17/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-sterling-825-and-827/|title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – Sterling 825 and 827|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia Eagles==
Braman and his brother-in-law, Ed Leibowitz, became owners of the Philadelphia Eagles in April 1985 having acquired them from [[Leonard Tose]] for a reported $65 million.  Initially, Braman owned 65% of the team while Leibowitz owned 35%.  In July 1986, Braman bought out Leibowitz’s interest.  During Braman's ownership, the Eagles made playoff appearances in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1992.  They were [[NFC East]] division champions in 1988.

In 1994, Braman agreed to sell the team to a group lead by movie producer [[Jeffrey Lurie]].  The reported selling price was $185 million, a record for a sports team franchise at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/sports/pro-football-eagles-purchased-for-record-amount.html|title=Eagles Sold for Record, Reported at $185 million|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 7, 1994|accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
He financially supported a [[recall election]] against Miami-Dade Mayor [[Carlos Alvarez (mayor)|Carlos Alvarez]] because of a huge property tax increase and pay hikes to Alvarez's top staffers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} On March 15, 2011 close to 90% of those that turned out to vote that day in Miami-Dade County, voted to recall the mayor. It is believed to be one of the most lopsided recall elections in the history of American elections.&lt;ref name=15MayrecallMH&gt;{{cite news|last=Haggman|first=Matthew|title=9 of 10 say ‘yes’ to ousting Alvare|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/03/15/2117129/9-of-10-say-yes-to-ousting-alvarez.html|accessdate=16 May 2011|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|date=15 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316212716/http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/03/15/2117129/9-of-10-say-yes-to-ousting-alvarez.html|archivedate=16 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Braman established political groups to campaign against four incumbent [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] commissioners with $440,000 in funding, focusing on the commissioners' support for the controversial [[Marlins Park]] project and a property tax hike in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article1941269.html|title=Norman Braman’s money gives challengers better shot at Miami-Dade Commission seats|last=Rabin|first=Charles|date=2012-07-16|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">'''Pieter Corbeels''' ([[Leuven]], 12 March 1755 – [[Tournai]], 21 June 1799) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] book printer and resistance leader. He was a founder of the Belgian based publishing company [[Brepols]]. He commanded part of the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] forces during a revolt against the French Revolutionary regime known as the ''[[Peasants' War (1798)|Boerenkrijg]]'' ("Peasants' War"). For his role in the war he was executed.

==Service in Austrian Army==

Corbeels, was a corporal in the [[Austria]]n army. He fought in the rebel army of [[Jean-André van der Mersch]], who won the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] against the Austrians in 1789. After the defeat of the [[Brabant Revolution]], he started a printing business in Leuven in 1790. He established his printing business in the Gommarushuis in the Tiensestraat in Leuven. Corbeels printed besides the ordinary, ordered printed papers, also a large number of inciting leaflets and almanacs. For this he was arrested by the French, on 28 November 1792, and transferred to [[Valenciennes]] in France. On 15 December 1792, he was released whereupon he resumed printing. In 1793 he moved into the house called ''Hertog van Brabant'' on the ''Grote Markt'' of Leuven. In 1796, he moved with his wife, Barbara Panz, and assistant, [[Philippus Jacobus Brepols]], to [[Turnhout]], where he was less impeded by the French. On 16 September 1797, his wife died and on 31 October he remarried with Joanna Antonia Servaes.

==Life in Turnhout and Peasants War== 

Corbeels remarried while living in Turnhout, and he left Turnhout in the summer of 1798 as a leader of the ''Boerenkrijg'' also known as the [[Peasants' War (1798)]] against the French. &lt;ref&gt;http://historiek.net/de-boerenkrijg/8675/&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 1798, he was caught in Postel and taken by the French, whereupon he ended up in the prison, and was executed, together with Albert Meulemans, on 21 June 1799 in Tournai.

His widow initially continued the printing business, together with Philippus Jacobus Brepols. But in 1800 he bought the business from her. The [[Brepols]] printing business in Turnhout, grew out of this.

{{Labor|sp=us}}
'''Precarity''' (also '''precariousness''') is a precarious existence, lacking in [[predictability]], [[job security]], [[materialism|material]] or [[psychology|psychological]] welfare. The social class defined by this condition has been termed the ''[[precariat]]''.

==Catholic origins==
[[Léonce Crenier]], a Catholic [[monk]] who had previously been active as an [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]], may have established the English usage.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 1952 the term was documented by [[Dorothy Day]], writing for the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]:

{{quote|True poverty is rare ... Nowadays communities are good, I am sure, but they are mistaken about poverty. They accept, admit on principle, poverty, but everything must be good and strong, buildings must be fireproof, Precarity is rejected everywhere, and precarity is an essential element of poverty. That has been forgotten. Here we want precarity in everything except the church. ... Precarity enables us to help very much the poor. When a community is always building, and enlarging, and embellishing, which is good in itself, there is nothing left over for the poor. We have no right to do this as long as there are slums and breadlines somewhere.|Anonymous Martinican priest, as quoted by Dorothy Day|The Catholic Worker, May 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/articles/633.html] "Poverty and Precarity," The Catholic Worker, May 1952, by Dorothy Day&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Europe==
{{Original research|date=October 2014}}

It is a term of everyday usage as ''Precariedad'', ''Precariedade'', ''Précarité'', or ''Precarietà'' in a number of European countries, where it refers to the widespread condition of temporary, flexible, contingent, casual, intermittent work in [[postindustrial]] societies, brought about by the neoliberal labor market reforms that have strengthened management and weakened the bargaining power of employees since the late 1970s.

''Precarity'' is a general term to describe how large parts of the population are being subjected to flexible exploitation or ''[[flexicurity|flexploitation]]'' (low pay, high blackmailability, intermittent income, etc.), and existential precariousness (high risk of social exclusion because of low incomes, welfare cuts, high cost of living, etc.) The condition of precarity is said{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to affect all of [[service sector]] labor in a narrow sense, and the whole of society in a wider sense, but particularly youth, women, and immigrants.

While [[contingent labor]] has been a constant of capitalist societies since the industrial revolution, [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] have argued&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire'', New York: Penguin Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; that the flexible labor force has now moved from the peripheral position it had under [[Fordism]] to a core position in the process of capitalist accumulation under [[Post-Fordism]], which is thought to be increasingly based on the casualized efforts of affective, creative, [[immaterial labor]]. There is scattered [[empirical evidence]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} in support of this thesis, such as the growing share of non-standard employment on the overall labor force, particularly on new hires. For example, in Western Europe, between a quarter and a third of the labor force now works under temporary and/or part-time contracts, with peaks in UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.

More problematic is that precarity seems to conflate two categories of workers that are at opposite ends of [[labor market segmentation]] in postindustrial economies: pink collars working in retail and low-end services (cleaners, janitors, etc.) under
constrictive but standardized employment norms; and young talent temping for cheap in the information economy of big cities around the world: the [[creative class]] of strongly individualistic workers illustrated by managerial literature.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}}

It also remains to be seen whether the insider–outsider division that economists observe in European labor markets means that the young, precarious, non-voting, and non-owning outsiders have fundamentally conflicting aims with respect to older insiders, who tend to work full-time, long-term contracts, enjoy relatively high pension benefits and who command a disproportionate weight in European public opinion and political debate.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}}

===Global justice movement===
Around 2000, the word started being used in its English usage by some [[global justice movement]] (sometimes identified with [[antiglobalization]]) activists (''Marches Européennes contre le chômage la précarité et les exclusions'' - European Marches against unemployment, precarity and social exclusion), and also in [[European Union|EU]] official reports on [[social welfare]]. But it was in the strikes of young part-timers at [[McDonald's]] and [[Pizza Hut]] in winter 2000, that the first political union network emerged in Europe explicitly devoted to fighting precarity: Stop Précarité, with links to AC!, [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]], SUD, [[Confédération nationale du travail|CNT]], [[Trotsky]]ists and other elements of the French radical left.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Mabrouki, ''Génération précaire'', Le Cherche Midi, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the Italian collectives and networks identifying with the global justice movement, as they were preparing for the [[Genoa]] counter-summit just months away, inaugurated in [[Milan]] a new kind of first of May, MAYDAY, spelling it like the [[Mayday (distress signal)|international call for rescue]], and explicitly centering it on the street representation of the so-called "precarious generation." It employed [[carnival]]-like techniques of agitation (allegorical wagons, media subvertising, colorful actions etc.) in imitation of [[gay pride]]s and love parades of the 1990s. Italian activists meant it as a revival of the [[wobbly]] traditions of [[May Day]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and consequently as a break with traditional union representation and social-democratic compromise that had allowed precarity and social insecurity to spread unchecked to reach critical levels in all of Europe, thus repeating the experience of UK and US economies with a few years' lag.

By 2003, the event had grown exponentially{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} in size, and Catalan global justice activists participated as non-neutral observers. In 2004, activists in [[Barcelona]] joined the Mayday efforts, as delegations of French "Intermittents" participated as guests of honor in both Mayday parades. The same year saw the launch of the [[icon]] of ''San Precario'', [[patron saint]] of the struggle against precarity. The religious imagery proved very popular in [[Italy]] and elsewhere, and would colonize the mainstream mediascape in the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} By virtue of all these developments, Mayday 2004 drew 80,000 young protesters from all over Italy. This attracted attention from other parts of [[Europe]].

===EuroMayDay===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
In October 2004, libertarian and syndicalist collectives from across Europe gathered at Middlesex University at "Beyond ESF" (a critical reference to the [[European Social Forum]] that was being held in London at the same time) in order to give life to a unified European May Day of precarious and migrant workers: '''EUROMAYDAY''', which involved a dozen [[Western Europe]]an cities in 2005, and about twenty in 2006, with Milan, Paris, Helsinki, Hamburg, and Sevilla among the most lively nodes. In 2006, the mayday process was launched in [[Brussels]] on [[Good Friday]] with a few hundred activists from Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany protesting against pro-business lobbies in Europe: "no borders, no precarity: fuck the new inequality!".

The [[EuroMayDay]] network has gathered several times across the EU to discuss in its assemblies common actions against precarity and mobilizations against the persecution of immigrants, and particularly the segregation of undocumented migrants in detention centers all over Europe. EuroMayDay demands the full adoption of the EU directive on temporary workers being blocked by the [[Barroso Commission]], as well as a European minimum wage and basic income. Cyber and queer rights are also part of the mayday deliberations and activities.

===Rebelling against precarity in France and Denmark===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
A core constituency of mayday has been the movement of [[Intermittents]], the French expression to refer to stage hands and showbiz personnel. In 2002–2005, the Intermittents captured the French imagination and filled the press with their inventive rebellious tactics (e.g. they disrupted live TV news programs and the 2004 edition of the Cannes festival) denouncing precarity in the form of cuts to their [[unemployment benefits]] (they counterproposed an alternative reform of the system which was so well crafted that put French élites and union leaders in an awkward position).

In the early months of 2006, French youth rejected the CPE, the first-job contract introduced by the government who made it easier to fire workers under age 26. Clashes with the riot police, as it reclaimed Sorbonne from occupying students was the signal that something major
was happening, as the university had been the epicenter of social insurgence in 1968. Four decades later, France was again paralyzed by huge student demonstrations and solidarity strikes called by the major French unions, as well as the more militant unions and organizations. With the vast majority of French universities occupied for more than a month, and the whole nation on strike, the [[Villepin]] government was forced to withdraw the provision, in a test of force with democracy in the streets that weakened the presidency itself. ''Le Monde'' commented that "précarité" was going to be a central issue in the upcoming 2007 presidential elections.

A few months before, France had been rocked by generalized rioting of the French youth of Arab and African descent in its suburban ghettos (''cités''), who sought to express angst at racial and economic discrimination that they were experiencing from the rest of French society. Although expressions of the same national malaise and social anguish, banlieue rioters and student protesters did not really share tactics and demands. The French explosion of 2006 against precarity was followed a few months later by a lengthy general strike in [[Denmark]] to protest against welfare cuts especially discriminatory with respect to young people. All universities were occupied, and the right-wing government was forced to withdraw the provisions that had to do with student subsidies and other welfare benefits for young people, although it retained pension cuts for older employees.

==="San Precario"===
February 29 is the [[feast day]] of San Precario, the [[patron saint]] of precarious workers, who – together with his feast day – was created by the [[Chainworkers]] at the [[Milan]]ese space [[Reload (collective)|Reload]] where the 2004 [[EuroMayDay]] was organised with others, including the [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] group. The Milan Critical Mass already had its own patron saint, "Santa Graziella" (''[[:it:Graziella (bicicletta)|Graziella]]'' is the brand name of a popular Italian [[folding bicycle]]).

San Precario was originally conceived as a male saint (Romano, 2004). The saint's first public appearance was at a Sunday supermarket opening on February 29, 2004: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A statue was carried in the streets, preceded by assorted clergy including a cardinal reciting prayers over a loudspeaker, and followed by pious people.&lt;ref name="journal.fibreculture.org"&gt;Marcello Tarì and Ilaria Vanni. [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/vanni_tari.html "On the Life and Deeds of San Precario, Patron Saint of Precarious Workers and Lives"]. ''The Fibreculture Journal'' '''5''', 2005. Retrieved March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ChainWorkers then performed a hoax during the 2005 [[Milan Fashion Week]], creating a fictive stylist, Serpica Naro,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chainworkers.org/SERPICANARO/index.html Serpica Naro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202182925/http://www.chainworkers.org/SERPICANARO/index.html |date=2012-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose name was an anagram of "San Precario".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Abbiamo creato Serpica Naro in 7 giorni e con pochi soldi' |author=Rosaria Amato |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/modanoglobal/intervistaserpica/intervistaserpica.html |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |date=February 26, 2005 |access-date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groups claim that the name functions like a multiple user name or myth such as [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] and quote the [[Wu Ming]] collective in giving theoretical coherence, although it is mostly seen as a [[détournement]] of the [[Catholic]] concept of patron saints.&lt;ref name="journal.fibreculture.org"/&gt;

== Precariat ==
{{main|Precariat}}
In [[sociology]], ''precariat'' refers to the [[social class]] formed by people with no [[job security]], or no prospect of regular employment, distinct from the [[lumpenproletariat]]. The term is a [[neologism]] obtained by merging ''precarious'' with [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Lunning (2010).[https://books.google.com/books?id=5d0Q9fdinQUC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=precariat+proletariat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XAtzTpGLO46Tswb4pJmOCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=precariat%20proletariat&amp;f=false'' Mechademia 5: Fanthropologies'']. University of Minnesota Press. p.&amp;nbsp;252. {{ISBN|081667387X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precariat class has been emerging in advanced societies such as Japan, where it includes over 20 million so-called "[[freeter]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/359fa9a8-8545-11df-9c2f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Y0hvtoZ1 Financial Times, July 1 2010: ''Japan has to address the ‘precariat’'']&lt;/ref&gt; The young precariat class in Europe became a serious issue in the early part of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Press Europe: Sept 15, 2011: The "Youthful members of the full-time precariat [http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/953511-youthful-members-full-time-precariat]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Railroad Tycoon 3''''' is a [[video game]], part of the ''[[Railroad Tycoon (series)|Railroad Tycoon]]'' series, released in 2003.

==Gameplay==
With nearly 60 locomotives in the game (nearly 70 in Coast to Coast expansion), the game has the most locomotives of the Railroad Tycoon franchise with locomotives from United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Poland, Russia and more even fictional locomotives like the E-88 and the TransEuro.

===New features===
The game interface is in full 3D, with free camera movement. The square grid is no longer rigid, as it was in ''Railroad Tycoon'' and ''[[Railroad Tycoon II]]'' - rail and structures can now be rotated 360 degrees.

The economic model has been reworked. In previous games, goods could only be picked up at a station, and revenue depended on the distance between stations. Carloads in ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' slowly move across the map (representing road and water transport) along the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar field]] representing price, where [[supply and demand]] sites function as sources and sinks. Revenue depends on the price difference between pick-up and delivery. This has several effects; raw materials can find their way to industries and get processed, without any trains involved, and a train does not need to pick up goods at the source.

Other changes include: each carload of mail, passengers and troops now has a destination; car setup can be automated, so that trains always pick up the cars that yield the most revenue; warehouse buildings also appear in the game, completing the commodity market the same way as ports do; trains can pass each other on a single track (as in the original ''Railroad Tycoon'' on lowest difficulty level); no need for signal towers, as well as station improvements (post offices, restaurants etc.), are placed individually on the map; players can buy industries, and also build processing industries wherever they like; processing industries have limited capacity, but they can be upgraded.

===Campaign===
The campaign of the game features 16 scenarios across a total of 5 continents with 7 Maps in North America, 6 Maps in Europe, 1 Map in Asia, 1 Map in Africa, and 1 Map in South America.

USA Campaign: 1840 - 1945. Scenarios: 5

Europe Campaign: 1840 - 1914 Scenarios: 5

World Campaign: 1880 - 1985 Scenarios: 3

Future Campaign: 2025 - 2080 Scenarios: 3

After you pass all scenarios on bronze or higher, you will be given the key to an anonymous city.

==Development==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

By May 2003, the game had been in development for one and a half years, after another one and a half years were spent on its game engine.&lt;ref name=cgmprev&gt;{{cite journal |title=Return of the King; PopTop Software Makes Its Bid for the Crown with ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' |author=Sones, Benjamin E. | issue=150 | date=May 2003 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | pages=54–58, 60–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Phil Steinmeyer had expressed his dislike of 3D graphics in strategy games, and felt that his company's next project after ''Tropico'' "would probably look better in straight pre-rendered 2D".&lt;ref name=steinmeyer3d&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inside the Sausage Factory; I Hate 3D |author=Steinmeyer, Phil | issue=143 | date=October 2002 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To manage the [[Popping (computer graphics)|popping]] inherent to [[level of detail]] systems in 3D graphics, the team created as many as six variants for the game's vehicles, buildings and other objects.

''Railroad Tycoon 3'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=metacritic /&gt;

Johnny L. Wilson of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised ''Railroad Tycoon 3''{{'}}s visuals, as well as the detail of its "marvelous" economics simulation. He considered the sequel "more than a face-lift" that simultaneously possessed "all the features that made its predecessors great". However, Wilson criticized its use of certain train models in countries where they had historically been absent.&lt;ref name=cgw /&gt; Writing for ''[[X-Play]]'', John Duggan called ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' "a serious time suck and highly addictive." While he criticized its changes to the ledger interface from ''Railroad Tycoon II'', he noted the sequel's "more sophisticated economic model", and summarized it as a "rewarding" experience.&lt;ref name=xplay /&gt;

[[GameSpy]] named ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' the tenth-best computer game of 2003,&lt;ref name=gamespytop10&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040723065149/http://archive.gamespy.com/goty2003/pc/ |url=http://archive.gamespy.com:80/goty2003/pc/ |title=GameSpy's PC Games of the Year; #10 ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' |author=Staff |date=December 2003 |work=[[GameSpy]] |archivedate=July 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the year's best "PC Empire Builder" game.&lt;ref name=gamespyempire&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805164500/http://archive.gamespy.com/goty2003/pc/index14.shtml |url=http://archive.gamespy.com:80/goty2003/pc/index14.shtml |title=GameSpy's 2003 Game of the Year Awards; PC Empire Builder - ''Railroad Tycoon 3'' |author=Staff |date=December 2003 |work=[[GameSpy]] |archivedate=August 5, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' nominated it for their 2003 "Strategy Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic]]''.

'''Roberto Alcántara Rojas''' (born April 19, 1950 in [[Acambay]], [[Mexico]]) is a Mexican entrepreneur and businessman, mainly dedicated to passenger transportation through land and air services. He is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Grupo IAMSA, one of the main passenger transportation consortiums in Mexico. He also has a 9.3% stake in the media conglomerate [[PRISA|Grupo Prisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisa.com/es/info/roberto-alcantara|title=¿Quiénes somos?|last=|first=|date=|website=Grupo Prisa|publisher=|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Roberto Alcántara is the son of the politician and businessman Jesus Alcántara Miranda, who was mayor of [[Acambay]], located in the [[State of Mexico]] and twice a federal congressman and senator. His grandfather, Manuel Alcántara, also served as senator and mayor in 1927 and, according to the chronicler Edgar Serrano, he brought electric light to the village.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://expansion.mx/expansion/2014/11/06/roberto-alcantara-el-empresario-del-sexenio|title=Roberto Alcántara, ¿el empresario del sexenio?,|last=|first=|date=November 11, 2014|work=CNN Expansión|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto Alcántara was an entrepreneur even during his childhood. With only 10 years old, he sold corn, lemonade and candies in the town market;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; an addition he used to sell women's stockings house by house.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://expansion.mx/expansion/2014/10/16/el-principal-transportista-de-mexico-cuenta-su-historia|title=Roberto Alcántara, dueño de Viva Aerobus, cuenta su historia|last=|first=|date=October 22, 2014|work=CNN Expansión|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcántara studied high school at the Franco Spanish School in [[Ciudad de México|Mexico City]]. Subsequently, his father commissioned him the business of a nixtamal mill. He was successful and soon opened several tortillerias and even established a corn transport company. Nonetheless, at the age of 29, he joined the bus company founded by his father: Grupo Toluca.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://expansion.mx/expansion/2014/11/06/roberto-alcantara-de-la-tortilla-al-autobus|title=El dueño de Viva Aerobus soñaba con un palacio de nixtamal|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2014|work=CNN Expansión|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Grupo Toluca partnered with Grupo Flecha Amarilla, a transportation company started by the Herrera family and renowned Mexican entrepreneurs. Thanks to this union between the two main interstate bus operators in Mexico, the largest transport consortium in the country was created: Grupo IAMSA. Alcántara initially acted as an advisor in the company and together with his team he began diversifying the business by entering into the luxury land transportation sector with the ETN bus line.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In August 1991, when the privatization of the Mexican bank system was announced, the Alcántara family bought Bancrecer, a financial institution. Bancrecer merged with BANORO, Somoza and Cortina Casa de Bolsa in order to integrate the Bancrecer Financial Group. Roberto Alcántara was named president of the Board of Directors of this institution, a position he held during nine years.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sexenio.com.mx/articulo.php?id=52925|title=Roberto Alcántara: una trayectoria de la tierra al aire|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2014|work=Sexenio|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank did not survive the financial crisis of 1994-1995 and the stock control was acquired by the Instituto para la Protección al Ahorro Bancario (IPAB), formerly known as the [[Fobaproa|Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro]] (Fobaproa). After reaching an agreement with the authorities, Bancrecer was finally given to the Mexican government in 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Transportation sector leader'''

Due to his experience in the sector, Roberto Alcántara presided the Cámara Nacional de Autotransporte de Pasaje y Turismo during 1992-1994 and 2002-2004. Moreover, and after his father's death, Alcántara would hold the presidency of Grupo IAMSA in 2005. Under his leadership, the consortium grew by adding dozens of small businesses and thus became the largest firm in the sector with more than 900 members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Currently, Grupo IAMSA is Mexico's only multimodal transport conglomerate (buses, railroad and airplanes), integrated in the terrestrial sector by four entities: Flecha Amarilla, Grupo Toluca, IAMSA and Omnibus de México.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grupo-iamsa.com.mx/|title=Quienes Somos|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of Grupo IAMSA|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has over 80 years of experience, operates in 24 states of the Mexican Republic and serves the major cities in the State of Texas and other cities on the East Coast of the United States. According to experts, it covers about 24% of the Mexican bus travelling market.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, it has more than 10 thousand units, representing about 25% of the total buses of the federal passenger transportation industry.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sipyt.com.mx/A1/quienes-somos|title=¿Quiénes somos?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sitio Oficial Servicios integrados de Pasaje y de Turismo|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grupo IAMSA generates more than 24 thousand jobs and offers its services to more than 300 million passengers per year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Among its most recognized brands are ETN, Omnibus, TAP, Amealcenses and Flecha Amarilla.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2006, Grupo IAMSA, in partnership with Grupo Irelandia (owner group of the airline [[Ryanair]]), founded the low-cost Mexican airline Viva Aerobus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Viva Aerobus began operating in November 2006 with two routes between Monterrey and Tijuana.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://expansion.mx/expansion/2014/11/06/el-romance-detras-de-la-alianza-alcantaraprisa|title=El ‘romance’ detrás de la alianza alcántara-prisa,|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2014|work=CNN Expansión|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, Viva Aerobus offers more than 60 routes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vivaaerobus.com/mx/destinos/nuestros-destinos|title=Destinos|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of Viva Aerobus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 the airline announced the renewal of its fleet by purchasing 52 Airbus A320 aircraft, becoming the airline with the youngest fleet in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dineroenimagen.com/2016-12-08/81134|title=Alcántara, su apuesta por VivaAerobus; Nucci y flota|last=|first=|date=December 8, 2016|work=Excélsior|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vivaaerobus.com/mx/nueva-viva|title=Nuestros aviones|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of VivaAerobus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vivaaerobus.com/mx/sala-de-prensa/comunicados/archivo-2013/octubre/vivaaerobus-anuncia-acuerdo-de-compra-de-52-aeronaves-airbus-a320|title=VivaAerobus anuncia acuerdo de compra de 52 aeronaves Airbus A320|last=|first=|date=|website=Press-Official website of VivaAerobus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, within the framework of the airline's tenth anniversary, Grupo IAMSA acquired a 100% stake in Viva Aerobus; it is now a fully Mexican company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/este-es-el-plan-de-roberto-alcantara-para-que-viva-aerobus-vuele-alto/#gs.XfvBJUU|title=Roberto Alcántara apuesta por consolidar a Viva Aerobus en el bajo costo|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2017|work=Forbes|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Viva Aerobus, Grupo IAMSA and Irelandia launched the airline [[VivaColombia|Viva Colombia]] in 2012. However, in December 2016, an agreement among the shareholders was established; it Irelandia to buy IAMSA's stake in the airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bolsamania.com/colombia/noticias/empresas/la-aerolinea-viva-colombia-pasara-a-manos-de-un-grupo-irlandes--2350478.html|title=La aerolínea Viva Colombia pasará a manos de un Grupo irlandés|last=|first=|date=December 9, 2016|work=Bolsamanía|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto Alcántara´s businesses have diversified into several sectors. Since 2008, his company Omnitren, together with the Spanish company [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF), began operating Mexico City´s suburban train.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2014, his company Telepeaje Dinámico won the public auction to operate the electronic toll system (IAVE).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although politicians like Andrés Manuel López Obrador&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lopezobrador.org.mx/2014/08/08/inicia-lopez-obrador-gira-por-sonora/|title="Nuevo negocito" el contrato que le otorgaron al paisano de Peña, Roberto Alcántara con IAVE, asegura AMLO|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2014|work=Lopez Obrador|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some PAN and PRD congressmen pointed out the existence of irregularities in this process, no official allegation was presented.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2678">The '''Shareholder Rights Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32007L0036 2007/36/EC], amended by the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017L0828 Directive 2007/828/EU] establishes requirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights attached to EU listed companies. It also establishes specific requirements in order to encourage shareholder engagement, in particular in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, paragraph 1 of amended directive, as amended by http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017L0828&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 replaced the First Company Law Directive [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31968L0151:en:NOT 68/151/EEC]. It set out minimum requirements relating to the holding of meetings in the EU. The directive was amended and largely extended by Directive 2017/828/EU of 17 May 2017 as regards the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement.
 
==Contents==
The directive's structure is as follows:
*Chapter Ia. Identification of shareholders, transmission of information, facilitation of exercise of shareholders rights 
*Chapter Ib. Transparency of institutional investors, asset managers and proxy advisors
*Chapter II on General meetings of shareholders including the remuneration of directors and related party transactions:
**art 5, shareholders should be given 21 days notice of meetings, votes by electronic means should be facilitated
**art 6, that a threshold no higher than 5% of shareholders must be able to table resolutions at meetings
**art 9, to ask questions
**art 10, to vote by proxy
**art 14, voting results publishable on website

{{Japanese name| Ōya }}
{{nihongo|'''Shinzō Ōya '''|大屋晋三| Ōya Shinzō |extra=5 July 1894 – 9 March 1980}} was an entrepreneur and politician, who served as [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]] in post-war Japan.&lt;ref name=Kotobank&gt;{{cite web|title=Ōya Shinzō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%A7%E5%B1%8B%E6%99%8B%E4%B8%89|work=Nihon jinmei daijiten+Plus|publisher=Kōdansha|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōya was born in what is now part of the town of [[Meiwa, Gunma |Meiwa]] in [[Gunma Prefecture]], where his father was a high school principal and his grandfather had been a [[samurai]] in the service of [[Kawagoe Domain]]. He graduated from what later became [[Hitotsubashi University]] in 1918. On graduation he joined the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' [[Suzuki Shoten]], and from 1925 went to work for [[Teijin]], eventually becoming its president in November 1945. 

In his early career, he was praised as a charismatic manager, who introduced new [[synthetic fiber]]s which made Teijin a market leader in the fabric industry. However, he later was criticized for over-diversification, and for his refusal to surrender authority over the company despite his obvious mental decline in old age, which led Teijin to the brink of bankruptcy.

In 1947, Ōya was elected to a seat in the [[Diet of Japan]] in [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 1947|1947 Upper House election]] from the Osaka electoral district, and was reelected for a second term, serving until June 1956 under [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party ]] (LDP) banner. From 19 October 1948 – 16 February 1949, he was Minister of Commerce and Industry under the 2nd [[Shigeru Yoshida]] administration, as well as interim [[Minister of Finance (Japan) |Minister of Finance]] from 14 December 1948 to 16 February 1949. During the 3rd Yoshida administration, Ōya served as [[Ministry of Transport (Japan)|Minister of Transport]] from 16 February 1949 to 28 June 1950.

Ōya was married to the singer and writer Ōya Masako.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:LA County Incorporated Areas Silicon Beach corehighlighted.png|thumb|right|Silicon Beach ''core'' within Los Angeles County, hence the term ''beach'', more loosely the entire [[LA Basin]] may be deemed Silicon Beach, including areas relatively far from the beaches.  Notably, the [[San Fernando Valley]] lies outside the basin.]] --&gt;
'''Silicon Beach''' is the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] region of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] that is home to over 500 tech [[Startup company|startup companies]], with emphasis on the coastal strip north of LAX to [[Santa Monica Mountains]], but the term may be applied loosely or [[colloquially]] to refer to most anywhere in the [[LA Basin]].  Major technology companies have opened offices in the region including [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], [[YouTube]], [[BuzzFeed]], [[Facebook]], [[Salesforce]], [[AOL]], [[Electronic Arts]],  [[EdgeCast Networks]], and [[MySpace]]. Additionally, several mobile ventures seeded here like [[Snapchat]] and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]]. In 2012, the region was considered the second- or third-hottest tech hub in the world, according to some metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Startup Genome Ranks The World’s Top Startup Ecosystems: Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv &amp; L.A. Lead The Way|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/20/startup-genome-ranks-the-worlds-top-startup-ecosystems-silicon-valley-tel-aviv-l-a-lead-the-way/ | work=TechCrunch | date=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silicon Beach emerges as a tech hotbed|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-07-15/silicon-beach/56241864/1 | work=USA Today | date=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the headquarters of these established corporate tech titans tends to be elsewhere, though the region has had startups proliferation.  Unlike the traditional definition of [[Silicon Valley]] (Menlo Park to Santa Clara) where the economy is overwhelmingly technology geared, Silicon Beach, much like San Francisco, tends to have a more diversified economy whereby tourism, finance, and/or other industries also play a major role.

==Detailed locations==

The tech influx has had major impacts on the type and availability of office space and on home prices in [[Playa Vista]], [[Playa Del Rey]], [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]], [[Santa Monica]], and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], already high previously due to beachfront location, has exacerbated the situation and the region suffers from many of the same high cost issues that led companies to flee Silicon Valley/SF Bay.

His family is the majority shareholder of '''IGB Corporation Berhad'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igbcorp.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan was reportedly one of the richest men in Malaysia and had several companies and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viweb.freehosting.net/TanCN.htm February 22, 2003 article on Dato Tan Chin Nam by Thean Lee Cheng]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viweb.freehosting.net/TanCN.htm Wednesday March 8, 2006 The Star Online article by Angie Ng]&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous as a property developer and was involved in various projects such as [[Shangri-La Hotel]] in Malaysia, shopping centres in [[Singapore]] and Malaysia, including one of the largest shopping malls in the world, [[Mid Valley Megamall]]. In Australia, he is responsible for the renovation of [[Queen Victoria Building]] (QVB) and [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] in Sydney. He also owns a number of [[Australia]]n-based [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]].

Tan's biography, released in 2006 and published by [[MPH Group|MPH Malaysia]], is called ''Never Say I Assume!''.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
The principal owner for one of Australia's most successful [[horse trainer]]s, [[Bart Cummings]], Tan had a successful working relationship with Cummings for more than thirty years until the latter's death in 2015.

He owned at least a share in most of Cummings' well-known horses, including [[Think Big (horse)|Think Big]] (co-owned with Queensland property developer Rick O'Sullivan and then joined by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]), winner of back-to-back [[Melbourne Cup]]s in 1974 and 1975, as well as the multiple [[Group One]] winner, [[Saintly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thoroughbrednews.co.nz/australia/default.asp?id=31863 ''Thoroughbred News'' article on Think Big Stud]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the owner of the [[2008 Melbourne Cup]] winner [[Viewed]], and is one of four thoroughbred owners to win the Melbourne Cup four Times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingvictoria.net.au/Racing/race.aspx?meet_code=5057556&amp;race_code=5003366 2008 Melbourne Cup result]&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned 2009 and 2010 [[Cox Plate]] winner [[So You Think]], and the winner of the 2009 [[Crown Oaks]], [[Faint Perfume]].

Tan owned a [[stud (animal)|stud]] farm located along the [[Wingecarribee River]] at [[Burradoo, New South Wales]] that he named Think Big Stud.

==Chess==
In 1975, Tan decided that there was great potential in expanding the game of [[chess]] in [[China]]. For the first eight years of the [[Cultural Revolution]], chess had been prohibited, but in 1974 there was an easing of the ban and, together with some leading Chinese officials, Tan set-up the "Big Dragon Project", with the aim of having China dominate the chess world by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Big Dragon Project|url=http://www.chessbase.com/columns/column.asp?pid=142|website=Chessbase News|accessdate=2015-11-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016080050/http://www.chessbase.com/columns/column.asp?pid=142|archivedate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 he became the first [[FIDE]] Deputy President for Asia.&lt;ref name=fide/&gt; Tan was also president of the Malaysian chess federation for many decades.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Long, Peter (2018-10-22).

'''''Wall Street''''' is a 1987 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], directed and co-written by [[Oliver Stone]], which stars [[Michael Douglas]], [[Charlie Sheen]], and [[Daryl Hannah]]. The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young [[stockbroker]] who becomes involved with [[Gordon Gekko]] (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous [[corporate raid]]er.

Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the [[Great Depression]]. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Carl Icahn]], [[Asher Edelman]], [[Michael Milken]], and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider [[Jimmy Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]]. Originally, the studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted [[Richard Gere]], but Gere passed on the role.

The film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that "greed is good." It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.

Stone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'', which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.

==Plot==
In 1985, Bud Fox is a junior [[stockbroker]] at Jackson Steinem &amp; Co. in [[New York City]]. He wants to work with his hero, [[Gordon Gekko]], a  legendary [[Wall Street]] player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some [[Insider trading|inside information]] about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company's maintenance workers union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money.

Gekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares to complete his takeover.

Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]] and a girlfriend, [[Interior decoration|interior decorator]] Darien. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in and is given a [[corner office]] with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as [[Straw purchase|straw buyers]] to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

Bud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and racked with the guilt of being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.

Bud devises a plan to drive up Bluestar's stock before manipulating it back down. He and the other union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy [[controlling interest]] in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.

Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in [[Central Park]]. Gekko physically assaults Bud as he berates him for his role with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later, Bud's parents drive him down [[FDR Drive]] towards the [[New York County Courthouse]] to answer for his crimes.

After the success of ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and [[Los Angeles]] screenwriter [[Stanley Weiser]] to research and write a screenplay about [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Weiser"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiser |first=Stanley |title=Repeat After Me: Greed is Not Good |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=October 5, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/05/entertainment/ca-wallstreet5 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; The director had been thinking about this kind of a movie as early as 1981&lt;ref name="Riordan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riordan |first=James |title=Stone: A Biography of Oliver Stone |work= |publisher=Aurum Press |date=September 18, 1996 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the [[Great Depression]] at [[Hayden Stone]].&lt;ref name="Demos"&gt;{{cite news |last=Demos |first=Telis |title=Oliver Stone: Life after ''Wall Street'' |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher= |date=September 21, 2007 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/20/news/newsmakers/oliver_stone.fortune/index.htm |accessdate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker knew a New York businessman who was making millions and working long days putting together deals all over the world. This man started making mistakes that cost him everything. Stone remembers that the "story frames what happens in my movie, which is basically a ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress|Pilgrim's Progress]]'' of a boy who is seduced and corrupted by the allure of easy money. And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone asked Weiser to read ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own. Stone then asked Weiser to read ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' for material that they could use, but it was not the right fit either.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; Weiser had no prior knowledge of the financial world and immersed himself in researching the world of stock trading, [[junk bond]]s, and corporate takeovers. He and Stone spent three weeks visiting [[brokerage firm|brokerage houses]] and interviewing investors.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt;

===Screenplay===
Weiser wrote the first draft, initially called ''Greed'', with Stone writing another draft. Originally, the lead character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed it to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Reportedly, Gordon Gekko is said to be a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavington|first=Stephen|title=Virgin Film: Oliver Stone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uf6jNxx0ppMC&amp;pg=PT145|year=2011|publisher=Ebury|isbn=9780753547663|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was involved in a $20 million insider trading scandal in 1985, [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]],&lt;ref name="Crowdus"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowdus |first=Gary |title=Personal Struggles and Political Issues |work=Cineaste |pages= |publisher= |year=1987 |url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=February 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226194916/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; corporate raider [[Carl Icahn]], [[art collector]] [[Asher Edelman]], agent [[Michael Ovitz]], and Stone himself.&lt;ref name="Weiser"/&gt; For example, the "Greed is good" line was based on a speech by Boesky where he said, "Greed is right".&lt;ref name="Sigesmund"/&gt;

According to [[Edward R. Pressman]], producer of the film, "Originally, there was no one individual who Gekko was modeled on", he adds, "But Gekko was partly [[Michael Milken|Milken]]". Also, Pressman has said that the character of Sir Larry Wildman was modeled on [[James Goldsmith]], the Anglo-French billionaire and corporate-raider.&lt;ref name="Goodley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodley |first=Simon |title=Brace Yourself, Gekko is Back |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |pages= |publisher= |date=October 27, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2814749/Brace-yourself-Gekko-is-back.html  |accessdate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weiser, Gekko's style of speaking was inspired by Stone. "When I was writing some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver on the phone and sometimes he talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Victor Hugo]], and the films of [[Paddy Chayefsky]] because they were able to make a complicated subject clear to the audience.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=Jay |title=Stone Gets Down to Business on ''Wall Street'' |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 4, 1987 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], which had not yet occurred.

===Casting===
Stone met with [[Tom Cruise]] about playing Bud Fox, but the director had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone liked the "stiffness" of Sheen's acting style and used it to convey Bud's naivete.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kiselyak |first=Charles |title=Money Never Sleeps: The Making of ''Wall Street'' |work=Wall Street: 20th Anniversary Edition DVD |pages= |publisher= [[20th Century Fox]] |year=2007 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and was looking for something dark and edgy.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; The studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted [[Richard Gere]] but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in [[Hollywood]] not to cast him.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone remembers, "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that "when he's acting he gives it his all".&lt;ref name="McGuigan, Cathleen"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGuigan |first=Cathleen |title=A Bull Market in Sin |work=[[Newsweek]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 14, 1987 |url=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said that he saw "that villain quality" in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman.&lt;ref name="Lipper"/&gt; Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, "I thought it was a great part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I'd never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders [[T. Boone Pickens]] and Carl Icahn.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt;

Stone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of [[Jack Lemmon]] or [[Martin Sheen]] to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone cast [[Daryl Hannah]] as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone also had difficulties with [[Sean Young]], who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers.&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; Stone admits that he had "some problems" with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.&lt;ref name="Lipper"/&gt;

===Principal photography===
Stone wanted to shoot the movie in [[New York City]] and that required a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed ''Platoon'' felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] took it to [[20th Century Fox]] and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Cynthia |title=1987: ''Wall Street'' Filmed in New York City |work=[[Newsday]] |pages= |publisher= |year=2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story,0,2269738.htmlstory |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207012006/http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story%2C0%2C2269738.htmlstory |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were shot in [[Snowbird, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, he was "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [director of photography [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]]] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup until you get to the fixed world of Charlie's father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values".&lt;ref name="Riordan"/&gt; The director saw [Wall Street] as a battle zone and "filmed it as such" including shooting conversations like physical confrontations and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors "in a way that makes you feel you're in a pool with sharks".&lt;ref name="Wuntch"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wuntch |first=P |title=Stone's War on Wall St |work=Herald |pages= |publisher= |date=December 21, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey "Mad Dog" Beck, a star investment banker at the time with [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], was one of the film's technical advisers and has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. [[Kenneth Lipper]], investment banker and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser.&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowan |first=Alison |title=Making ''Wall Street'' Look Like Wall Street |work=[[New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 30, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique.&lt;ref name="Welles"&gt;{{cite news |last=Welles |first=Chris |title=The Platoon of Pros Who Helped Out on ''Wall Street'' |work=[[Business Week]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 21, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be "morally bankrupt".&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"/&gt; Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his "Greed is good" speech.&lt;ref name="Cowan, Alison"/&gt; Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot on the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] during trading hours.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt; Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt;

Stone also consulted with Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, convicted inside trader [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]], several government prosecutors, and Wall Street investment bankers.&lt;ref name="Lipper"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lipper |first=Hal |title=The Stone Age |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 13, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, traders were brought in to coach actors on the set on how to hold phones, write out tickets, and talk to clients.&lt;ref name="Welles"/&gt; Stone asked Lipper to design a six-week course that would expose Charlie Sheen to a cross section of young Wall Street business people. The actor said, "I was impressed and very, very respectful of the fact that they could maintain that kind of aggressiveness and drive".&lt;ref name="Rattner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rattner |first=Steven |title=From Vietnam to ''Wall Street'' |work=[[New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=August 30, 1987 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas worked with a speech instructor on [[Vocal pedagogy|breath control]] in order to become better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his "repressed anger", according to the actor.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because "you look like you haven't acted before".&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the "Greed is good" speech.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt; Stone planned to use a ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with ''Fortune'', which upset ''Forbes'' publisher [[Malcolm Forbes]], who turned down a later request to use his private yacht.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite news |last=Garcia |first=Guy D |title=In the Trenches of Wall Street |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |pages= |publisher= |date=July 20, 1987 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965026,00.html |accessdate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days in the last few weeks in order to finish principal photography before an impending [[Directors Guild of America]] strike and finished five days ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt; Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.&lt;ref name="Kiselyak"/&gt;

The film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating "greed, for lack of a better word, is good".&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Brian |title=Greed on Wall Street |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher= |date=November 11, 2005 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1305010 |accessdate=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wall Street'' defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty,&lt;ref name="Gabriel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gabriel |first=Satya J | title=Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' and the Market for Corporate Control |work=Economics in Popular Film (course) |publisher=Mount Holyoke |date=November 21, 2001 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/sgabriel/filmcourse/oliver_stone.html |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | title=The Return of Greed | url=http://www.newsweek.com/return-greed-146987 | work=Newsweek | date=July 18, 2002 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Doyle | first=Jack | title="Greed is Good" speech | url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/tag/greed-is-good-speech/ | work=The Pop History Dig | date=February 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl ([[Martin Sheen]]'s character) represents the working class in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]''. In ''Wall Street'' the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the [[creative destruction]] brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt;

A significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the [[Wall Street]] raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The inspiration for the "Greed is good" speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by [[Carl Icahn]] about companies he was trying to take over.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur [[Ivan Boesky]] (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dickerson | first=John F. | title=Battling Boeskys | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978367,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=May 3, 1993 | accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/haas/about/commencementspeakers.html | title=Commencement Speakers | publisher=Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley  | accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wall Street'' is not a wholesale criticism of capitalism, but of the cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt; The "good" characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that "good things sometimes take time", referring to [[IBM]] and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]—in contrast, Gekko's "Greed is Good" credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gabriel"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Wall Street'' was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $43.8 million in North America.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''Wall Street'' |work=Box Office Mojo |pages= |publisher= |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wallstreet.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has a 78% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a 56 metascore on [[Metacritic]]. In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]], while quite critical of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as "the funniest, canniest performance of his career".&lt;ref name="Canby, Vincent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Stone's ''Wall Street'' |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |publisher= |date=December 11, 1987 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE6D61E38F932A25751C1A961948260 |accessdate=May 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense.

''Wall Street'' enjoyed renewed interest in the film in 1990 when the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine asked, "Is Greed Dead?" after 1980s icons like [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]] ran afoul of insider trading laws.&lt;ref name="Demos"/&gt; Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I wanted to get into such and such business.

[[Enron]] is a fiction, in a sense, in the same way that Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... [[Kenneth Lay|Kenny Lay]]—he's the new Gordon Gekko".&lt;ref name="Sigesmund"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sigesmund |first=B.J |title=The Return of Greed |work=[[Newsweek]] |pages= |publisher=|year=2002 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2002/07/18/the-return-of-greed.html |accessdate=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine's [[Owen Gleiberman]] recently commented that the film, "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''Wall Street'': What it still has to tell us |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |pages= |publisher=|date=March 28, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/28/a-look-back-at/ |accessdate=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20th-anniversary edition was released on September 18, 2007. New extras include an on-camera introduction by Stone, extensive [[deleted scene]]s, "Greed is Good" featurettes, and interviews with Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen.&lt;ref name="Croce"&gt;{{cite news |last=Croce |first=Fernando F |title=''Wall Street'' |work=Slant |date=September 15, 2007 |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wall-street-20th-anniversary-edition/1209 |accessdate=December 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143733/http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/wall-street-20th-anniversary-edition/1209 |archivedate=May 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the film's sequel 23 years later, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that though the original film was "intended as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed, Stone's 1987 original instead had the effect of turning Douglas' hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon -- an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set such a terrible example".&lt;ref name="Chang0510"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Justin |title=CANNES: Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages= |publisher=|date=May 14, 2010 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942753.html/ |accessdate=August 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:

'''Whitehall Street''' is a street in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]], about four blocks long. The street begins at the southern end of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], at the intersection with Stone Street. Whitehall Street stretches south to the southern end of [[FDR Drive]], adjacent to the [[Staten Island Ferry]]'s [[Whitehall Terminal]], on landfill beyond the site of [[Peter Stuyvesant]]'s 17th-century house. 

The street is one-way southbound for three blocks from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] to [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]], and one-way northbound up from the FDR Drive to Pearl Street. The southernmost block, adjacent to the ferry terminal, provides access from FDR Drive to the Battery area.

[[File:Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|size|300px|Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal]]
There is an active passenger [[ferry]] terminal at the southern tip of Whitehall Street: the [[Whitehall Terminal]], which serves the [[Staten Island Ferry]]. However, its facilities in use have shifted over the decade, as have the destinations served. The original Whitehall Terminal served [[Brooklyn]], [[Governors Island]], [[Staten Island]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], and it was originally served mainly by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]'s elevated train lines at [[South Ferry (IRT elevated station)|South Ferry station]]. Furthermore, the terminal once served vehicular traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statenislandmuseum.org/articles/id-132-cPath-57/Staten+Island+Ferry:++The+first+100+years.html Staten Island Museum website], retrieved February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subways have replaced the els, and cars now use fixed crossings such as the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite aia5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|24}} The structure was renovated in the 1950s and reopened in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/07/24/archives/ferry-station-to-open-2800000-whitehall-terminal-starts-operating.html|title=FERRY STATION TO OPEN; $2,800,000 Whitehall Terminal Starts Operating Today|date=1956-07-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was destroyed by fire in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/09/nyregion/big-fire-destroys-terminal-of-ferry-to-staten-island.html|title=BIG FIRE DESTROYS TERMINAL OF FERRY TO STATEN ISLAND|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=1991-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was renovated in 1992&amp;ndash;2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title =Guide to Contemporary New York City Architecture |last =Hill |first =John |pages =20 |publisher =W.W.
