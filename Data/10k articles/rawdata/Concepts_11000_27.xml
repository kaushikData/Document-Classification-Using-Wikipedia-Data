On July 4, 2003 44 [[Hazara people|Hazara]] [[Shia Muslim|Shias]] were killed and at least 65 others were injured when the mosque was attacked during the [[Friday prayer]] in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP, Quetta |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/07/05/d3070501011.htm |title=The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 4 Num 39 |publisher=Thedailystar.net |date=2003-07-05 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday July 4, 2003 when hundreds of [[Ibadah|worshipers]] were offering [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]], three armed men enter the ''Asna Ashari Hazara [[Hussainia|Imambargah]]'' and started [[shooting]], threw [[Grenade|hand grenades]] and one [[Suicide attack|suicide bomber]] blew himself which left more than 50 dead and tens of others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP, Quetta|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/07/05/d3070501011.htm |title=The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 4 Num 39 |publisher=Thedailystar.net |date=2003-07-05 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was second major sectarian attack on [[Hazara people|Hazara community]] in Quetta after the massacre of Police cadets. It was the start of the [[Persecution of Hazara people in Quetta|Series of Hazara Killings in Quetta]].

==Bombing==
On Friday July 4, 2003 hundreds of worshipers were practicing [[Friday prayer]] in Asna Ashri Hazara Imambargah Kalan (mosque). five men armed with automatic weapons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220701&lt;/ref&gt; enter the mosque start shooting for ten continuous minutes and tried to throw grenade but it blew in his hand, people disarmed one of them and killed a third one. Two of them ran away from the roof. This incident left more 65 dead and tens of others injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,463128,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetrators===
[[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi|Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ)]], a banned [[terrorist group]], was responsible for the attack on the mosque. After investigations the Intelligence agencies found a video [[compact disc]] in which two people are shown who claimed their people attacked on the mosque and they were going to meet them in the paradise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-5-2004_pg7_10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
*[[Pervez Musharraf]], [[Presidents of Pakistan|President]] of [[Pakistan]] at the time, winded up his 18-day trip to [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]]. He was in a news conference in [[Paris]] when he heard the news.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,463128,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Islamabad, he said&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220701&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|''Whether they are religious extremists or sectarian extremists they are ignorant and wild.''}}

*In response, [[Pakistan Police|police]] in Quetta arrested around 19 culprits who were found involved in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/07/pakistan|title=19 arrested after attack on mosque|accessdate=7 July 2003|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

==In philosophy&lt;!--'Third Realm (Frege)' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson, [http://www.edwardheath.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Social_Agentivity.pdf "A Theory of Social Agentivity and Its Integration into the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering"], ''[[International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems]]'' '''7'''(4) (2011) pp. 62–86.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attitudes of Lady Hamilton by Novelli.jpg|thumb|right|Emma, [[Lady Hamilton]] made the striking of attitudes into an art form, portraying classical themes such as the [[Judgement of Paris]].]]
'''Attitude''' as a term of [[fine art]] refers to the [[human position|posture]] or [[gesture]] given to a [[Figurative art|figure]] by a [[painting|painter]] or [[sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;John Craig, ''A New Universal Etymological, Technological, and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language Embracing All the Terms Used in Art, Science, and Literature'' (London, 1844), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0Tup952oMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA130&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to the [[human body|body]] and not to a [[mental state]]&lt;!--this link to a disambiguation page is deliberate--&gt;, but the arrangement of the body is presumed to serve a communicative or expressive purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Woldmar Ruoff, ''The Standard Dictionary of Facts'' (The Frontier press company, 1916), p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mm0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA222&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[Convention (norm)#Others|conventional]] attitude in art is [[proskynesis]] to indicate submissive respect toward [[Christian God|God]], [[emperor]]s, [[cleric]]s of high status, and religious [[icon]]s; in [[Byzantine art]], it is particularly characteristic in depictions of the emperor paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Ross, ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22PROSKYNESIS.+The+Greek+term%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th- and 21st-century [[art history]], "attitude" is used most often to label one of these conventional postures; another example is the [[orans]] pose.

"Attitude" was arguably more important as an [[aesthetic]] term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of [[wikt:ponderation|ponderation]], and whatever refers to the [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]]; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will. It must, besides, have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the character of the figure, may diffuse a [[beauty]] over the action. It is allowed that the choice of fine attitudes constitutes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;John Gould, ''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Artists: Comprising Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, and Architects, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time'' (London: E. Wilson, 1835), p. xc [https://books.google.com/books?id=O54ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP104&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9684">As a result of advances in technology, [[information technology]] has become a highly important economic sector. Although it is relatively new, this industry still experiences many of the workplace culture problems of older industries. [[Bullying]] is common in IT, leading to high sickness rates, low [[morale]], poor [[productivity]] and high [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]].&lt;ref name="Marcello"&gt;Marcello C Perceptions of Workplace Bullying Among IT Professionals: A correlational analysis of workplace bullying and psychological empowerment of Workplace Bullying Among IT Professionals (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT professionals.&lt;ref name="Thomson2"&gt;Thomson R [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/04/03/230127/IT-profession-blighted-by-bullying.htm IT profession blighted by bullying] Computer Weekly 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying in IT is most commonly downwards hierarchical (such as manager to employee) but can also be horizontal (such as employee to employee) or upwards hierarchical (such as employee to manager).&lt;ref name=Marcello/&gt;

==Incidence==

* Middle managers are prone to being bullied from above and/or below in the hierarchy
* A high percentage of senior IT management possess very poor [[people skills]] or may have a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality
* [[Mediation]] needs to be done by a fully trained impartial external mediator with a good track record, which are not available at most workplaces
* A system to report bullying anonymously may be helpful
* Victims often have [[misplaced loyalty]] with a company and stay too long [[trusting]] that they would get support
* Bullying in IT is often encouraged and institutionalized as a way of boosting competitiveness among employees 
* Information Technology bullies may use their advanced computer skills to hack into their victim's computers and/or participate in [[cyberbullying]] against their victim

'''''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''''' ({{lang-es|Emporio celestial de conocimientos benévolos}}) is a fictitious [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of animals described by the writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his 1942 essay "[[The Analytical Language of John Wilkins]]" (''El idioma analítico de John Wilkins'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | page = 231 | contribution = John Wilkins' Analytical Language | others = Eliot Weinberger, transl. | title = Selected nonfictions | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | editor-first = Eliot | editor-last = Weinberger | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | ISBN = 0-14-029011-7}}.  The essay was originally published as {{Citation | contribution = El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | title = [[La Nación]] | date = 8 February 1942 | place = Argentina | language = Spanish}}, and republished in ''Otras inquisiciones''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[John Wilkins|Wilkins]], a 17th-century philosopher, had proposed a [[universal language]] based on a classification system that would encode a description of the thing a word describes into the word itself—for example, ''Zi'' identifies the genus ''beasts''; ''Zit'' denotes the "difference" ''rapacious beasts of the dog kind''; and finally ''Zitα'' specifies ''dog''.

In response to this proposal and in order to illustrate the arbitrariness and cultural specificity of any attempt to categorize the world, Borges describes this example of an alternate taxonomy, supposedly taken from an ancient Chinese encyclopædia entitled ''Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge''.

The list divides all animals into 14 categories:
* Those that belong to the emperor
* [[Embalming|Embalmed]] ones
* Those that are trained
* Suckling pigs
* Mermaids (or [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s)
* Fabulous ones
* Stray dogs
* Those that are included in this classification
* Those that tremble as if they were mad
* Innumerable ones
* Those drawn with a very fine [[camel hair brush]]
* ''[[Et cetera]]''
* Those that have just broken the flower vase
* Those that, at a distance, resemble flies

Borges claims that the list was discovered in its Chinese source by the translator [[Franz Kuhn]].&lt;ref&gt;A slightly different English translation is at: {{Citation | first =Jorge | last = Luis Borges | url= http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html | title = The Analytical Language of John Wilkins | others = Lilia Graciela Vázquez, transl. | date = April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = esen&gt;{{Citation | first = Jorge Luis | last = Borges | url= http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/wilkins.html | title= El idioma analítico de John Wilkins | date =April 8, 2006 | language = Spanish, English| publisher = Crockford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = RJ Ohara | url = http://rjohara.net/darwin/logs/1996/9609a | title = Darwin-L | type = mailing list archive | contribution = Borges | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of the list ==
This list has stirred considerable philosophical and literary commentary.

[[Michel Foucault]] begins his preface to ''[[The Order of Things]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Michel Foucault | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title=The Order of Things : An Archaeology of Human Sciences | publisher=Vintage | year= 1994 | origyear = 1966 | page=XVI|isbn=0-679-75335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of thought—''our'' thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography—breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old definitions between the Same and the Other.}}

Foucault then quotes Borges' passage.

[[Louis Sass]] has suggested, in response to Borges' list, that such "Chinese" thinking shows signs of typical schizophrenic thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Louis Sass | first = Louis | last =Sass | title = Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature and Thought | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1994 | origyear = 1992 | isbn= 0-674-54137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the linguist [[George Lakoff]] has pointed out that while Borges' list is not possibly a human categorization, many categorizations of objects found in nonwestern cultures have a similar feeling to Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = George Lakoff | first = George | last = Lakoff | title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1987 | isbn=0-226-46804-6 | url = http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/SocialConstruction/LakoffWomenFireDanger.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, cited alleged acceptance of the authenticity of the list by many academics as a sign of the degeneration of the Western academy&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Keith Windschuttle |first=Keith |last=Windschuttle|title=Absolutely Relative |publisher=National Review |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |contribution=Academic Questions |date=September 15, 1997 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308191710/http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/windschuttle091597.html |archive-date=March 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a terminal lack of humor.

== Attribution ==

Scholars have questioned whether the attribution of the list to [[Franz Kuhn]] is genuine. While Kuhn did indeed translate Chinese literature, Borges' works often feature many learned pseudo-references resulting in a mix of facts and fiction. To date, no evidence for the existence of such a list has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/7/7-1446.html |title=LINGUIST List 7.1446: Borgesian joke |publisher=Linguistlist.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borges himself questions the veracity of the quote in his essay, referring to "the unknown (or false) Chinese encyclopaedia writer".&lt;ref name=esen/&gt;

'''Compulsory sterilisation in Sweden''' were [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]]s which were carried out in Sweden, without a valid consent of the subject, during the years 1906–1975 on eugenic, medical and social grounds. Between 1972 and 2012, sterilisation was also a condition for [[sex change]].

== Legal grounds ==
The general rule between 1941 and 1976 was that sterilisation was illegal, but there were three grounds on which sterilisation could be permitted:&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1974:25 ''[[:Commons:SOU 1974 25 Fri sterilisering.djvu|Fri sterilisering]]'', &lt;small&gt;"The current Sterilization Law (1941: 282) is restrictive. License is required for sterilization and permission is granted only if certain restricted conditions of an eugenic, social or medical nature are fulfilled."&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* Medical, if a pregnancy could seriously put a woman suffering from chronic illness or permanently weakened constitution at risk of life and health.
* [[Eugenics|Eugenic]], which allowed sterilising people considered insane or with severe illness or with a physical disability.
* Social indication allowed sterilisation of people considered unsuitable to foster a child due to [[mental illness]], being [[feebleminded]] or having an [[antisocial lifestyle]].

It was never legal to physically restrain a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| quote                 = The Swedish laws never allowed the use of physical force. Furthermore the great majority of sterilisations were made following a personal application. Nevertheless many sterilisations took place in a context of compulsion or coercion, as it would be defined today.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1944, the number of [[eugenics|eugenic]] sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Statistics==

The number of eugenic sterilisations peaked in the 1940s; from 1944, the number of sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1997, on behalf of the Swedish government, the ethnologists Mikael Eivergård and Lars-Eric Jönsson made an attempt at estimating what percentage of sterilisations were coerced. They found that a quarter of the applications were made under circumstances similar to coercion such as a condition for release from an institution and that another 9 percent were signed under pressure. In half of the cases they found no sign of coercion or pressure, but signs of the applicants own initiative. Tydén uses these percentages to make an estimate of the number of operations under coercion. He found that 15,000 were made as a condition for release and that another 5500 to 6000 were made under other kinds of pressure, whereas 30,000 were voluntary and on the applicants' own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International| isbn = 978-91-22-01958-9| last = Tydén| first = Mattias| title = Från politik till praktik : de svenska steriliseringslagarna 1935-1975| location = Stockholm| series = Stockholm studies in history, 0491-0842 ; 63| date = 2002|pages = 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sterilisation during sex change ==

Until 2012, sterilisation was mandatory before [[sex change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/38466/20120112/ Sweden keeps sex-change sterilisation law], [[The Local]], January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This last mandatory sterilisation has been criticised by several political parties in Sweden and since 2011 the [[Parliament of Sweden]] was expected to change the law but ran into opposition from the Christian Democrat party. After efforts to overturn the law failed in parliament, the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal overturned the law on 19 December 2012, declaring it unconstitutional&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/14/transgender-people-in-sweden-no-longer-face-forced-sterilisation/ | title=Transgender People in Sweden No Longer Face Forced Sterilisation | last=Nelson | first=Rebecca | newspaper=Time | issn=0040-781X | access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/sweden-transgender-sterilisation-law-overturned_n_2472925.html | title=Good News For Sweden's Transgender Residents | date=2013-01-14 | website=The Huffington Post | access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the law was challenged by an unidentified plaintiff.

A '''continuous cooling transformation''' ('''CCT''') phase diagram is often used when heat treating steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Transformation diagrams (CCT &amp; TTT) | url = http://www.matter.org.uk/steelmatter/metallurgy/7_1_2.html
 | accessdate =2008-04-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams are used to represent which types of phase changes will occur in a material as it is cooled at different rates. These diagrams are often more useful than [[Isothermal transformation|time-temperature-transformation]] diagrams because it is more convenient to cool materials at a certain rate than to cool quickly and hold at a certain temperature.

==Types of Continuous Cooling Diagrams==

There are two types of continuous cooling diagrams drawn for practical purposes

* Type 1: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against transformation time on each cooling curve.
* Type 2: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against cooling rate or bar diameter of the specimen for each type of cooling medium.

A '''Criegee intermediate''' (also called a '''Criegee [[zwitterion]]''' or '''Criegee [[biradical]]''') is a [[carbonyl]] [[oxide]] with two charge centres. These [[molecules]] help to break down [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] in the atmosphere, and may help offset [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Oliver |last1= Welz |first2= John D. |last2= Savee |first3= David L. |last3= Osborn |first4= Subith S. |last4= Vasu |first5= Carl J. |last5= Percival |first6= Dudley E. |last6= Shallcross |first7= Craig A. |last7= Taatjes |title= Direct Kinetic Measurements of Criegee Intermediate (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OO) Formed by Reaction of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal= Science |date= 13 January 2012 |volume= 335 |issue= 6065 |pages= 204–207 |doi= 10.1126/science.1213229 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..204W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news| last=Castro| first=Joseph| title=How mysterious molecules may help cool Earth|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45975663/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TxCB1PmGmSo|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2012-01-12 |date= January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desert''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˈ|z|ɜːr|t}}) in [[philosophy]] is the condition of being deserving of something, whether good or bad.

==Nomenclature==
{{wiktionary|just deserts}}

The word is related to [[justice]], [[revenge]], [[blame]], [[punishment]] and many topics central to moral philosophy, also "moral desert". In the English language, the word "desert" with this meaning tends to be a rather uncommon word [[colloquial]]ly; it is almost exclusively used in the phrase "just deserts" (e.g. "Although she was not at first arrested for the crime, she later on received her just deserts."). The phrase "just desserts" is a pun on this original term and is often confused as the correct spelling of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oup.com/2007/10/corpus-2/|title=Are We Giving Free Rei(g)n to New Spellings? {{!}} OUPblog|date=2007-10-18|work=OUPblog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary usage, to deserve is to earn or merit a reward; in philosophy, the distinction is drawn in the term desert to include the case that which one receives as one's just deserts may well be unwelcome, or a reward. For example, if one scratches off a winning lottery ticket, one may be ''entitled'' to the money, but one does not necessarily ''deserve'' it in the same way one would deserve $5 for mowing a lawn, or a round of applause for performing a solo. While "moral desert" refers to any type of outcome that morally 'fits' or reflects one's actions,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} the punned term "moral desserts" refers specifically to a reward, as one might receive a 'reward' of dessert for eating their meal.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Formulation==
''Desert claims'' may be generally expressed as: ''Thing '''X''' deserves '''Y''' in virtue of '''Z'''.'' For example, ''I (X) deserve a good grade on my test (Y) because I studied hard (Z)''; ''Cincinnati (X) deserves to be praised (Y) because it is a pretty city (Z).'' Some authors have added a further criterion, qualifying '''Z'''. That is, Agent X deserves Y in virtue of Z ''if X is responsible for Z (or, alternatively, if X is also deserving of Z)''. Considering this stipulation, one does not deserve respect simply because one is a human being, because one is not responsible for being a human being (Z). Arguments such as this are contentious as they suggest an untenability of [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] desert claims—that is, claims wherein Z means simply to be X. Less controversially, if one (X) uses steroids to win in a footrace, one is said not to deserve to win (Y) because one is not responsible for, and so does not deserve, one's enhanced physical abilities (Z).

==Controversies around Rawls dismissal of the concept of desert==
One of the most controversial rejections of the concept of desert was made by the political philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Rawls, writing in the mid to late twentieth century, claimed that a person cannot claim credit for being born with greater natural endowments (such as superior intelligence or athletic abilities), as it is purely the result of the 'natural lottery'. Therefore, that person does not morally deserve the fruits of his or her talents and/or efforts, such as a good job or a high salary. However, Rawls was careful to explain that, even though he dismissed the concept of moral Desert, people can still legitimately expect to receive the benefits of their efforts and/or talents. The distinction here lies between Desert and, in 
Rawls' own words, 'Legitimate Expectations'.&lt;ref&gt;See Rawls, John (1972), ''A Theory of Justice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls' remarks about natural endowments provoked an often-referred response by [[Robert Nozick]]. Nozick claimed that to treat peoples' natural talents as collective assets is to contradict the very basis of the deontological liberalism Rawls wishes to defend, i.e. respect for the individual and the distinction between persons.&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, Robert (1974), ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'', New York: Basic Books, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick argued that Rawls' suggestion that not only natural talents but also virtues of character are undeserved aspects of ourselves for which we cannot take credit, "can succeed in blocking the introduction of a person's autonomous choices and actions (and their results) only by attributing everything noteworthy about the person completely to certain sorts of 'external' factors. So denigrating a person's autonomy and prime responsibility for his actions is a risky line to take for a theory that otherwise wishes to buttress the dignity and self-respect of autonomous beings."&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, Robert (1974), ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'', New York: Basic Books, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nozick's critique has been interpreted in different ways. The conventional understanding of it is as a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] assessment of procedural justice, which maintains that while it might be true that people's actions are wholly or partly determined by factors that are morally arbitrary, this is irrelevant to assignments of distributive shares.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Andrew (1999), "Rewarding Effort", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'' 7: 404-418, at p. 406f.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are self-owners with inviolable rights in their bodies and talents, and they have the freedom to take advantage of these regardless of whether the self-owned properties are theirs for reasons that are morally arbitrary or not.

Others have suggested that Rawls has entirely mistaken the very logic of desert.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert, Michael (1981) Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' "A Theory of Justice", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483&lt;/ref&gt; If justice is getting what one is due, then the basis of desert must ultimately be undeserved. However, desert is a relational concept that expresses a relationship between a deserved{{clarify|date=July 2018}} and a basis of desert. It simply destroys the character of desert to demand, as Rawls does, that the basis of desert be itself deserved. For example, if we say a man deserves some primary good because of some quality or action "Y", we can always ask, as Rawls does, "but does he deserve 'Y'?" and so on. We then either have an infinite regress of bases of desert or arrive at some basis, some beginning point, which the individual cannot claim to have deserved or to be responsible for, but only to have or have been given by nature. After all, no human being exists [[causa sui]]; even to reduce the basis of claims to the very narrow one of life itself reveals Rawls' difficulty: surely no one can "deserve" or "claim credit for" their own existence.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

To demand, as Rawls does, that no just claim rest on an undeserved base simply means that we must cease speaking about justice, for on the basis of that demand there can never be any just claims - not even for equality.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Rawls' analysis of justice rests on a notion of desert which violates the concept of desert and therefore does not provide a more precise notion of the bases of desert, but rather dissolves entirely the concept of desert and with it justice.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The many debates over justice in political life and in philosophy concern the actual substantive question of what are the proper bases of desert.{{cn|date=July 2018}} That is, underlying every conception of justice must be a claim of right, a positive claim of desert.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The great failing of Rawls' argument is that he provides no substantive basis for a claim right or desert; but this failing is, paradoxically, also the source of the great appeal or excitement about Rawls' theory.{{cn|date=July 2018}} His approach seems to avoid the difficulties of the traditional debates and the value questions they necessarily raise and yet seems to enable him to discuss normative questions such as justice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert, Michael (1981), Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' "A Theory of Justice", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jean Hampton==
Another, more unconventional{{cn|date=July 2018}} interpretation of Nozick's critique is proposed by [[Jean Hampton]]. She points out that there seems to be a subterranean assumption in Nozick's rejection of Rawls' account of natural endowments as collective assets. This assumption is the idea that the choices individuals make regarding how they will use their labor and their property are ones for which they should be held responsible. People who do not work hard and invest imprudently should be held responsible for those choices and not receive assistance from an egalitarian welfare state. If they do work hard and invest well however, they should also be held responsible for those choices and allowed to reap the benefits from their strivings. Hampton asks the question "whether the ground of Nozick's conception of absolute rights is not only a conception of liberty but also a conception of moral responsibility that is […] closely associated to our notion of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Jean (1997), ''Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Westview Press, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other political philosophers who endorse the position Hampton outlines. Their main observation is that sometimes people who are badly off might be so because of their own irresponsible conduct, and the charge is that theories favoring policies of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor ignore this crucial point, i.e. that people might be unequally deserving because of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kekes, John (1997)'' Against Liberalism'', New York: Cornell University Press, p. 132f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Sometimes the claim is that the redistributive systems often favored by [[egalitarian]] political theorists might have disastrous consequences in that they promote sloth and allow free riding on the productive by the lazy. These arguments are ''instrumental'' in their appeal to undeservingness. They refer to the allegedly bad consequences of a redistributive social system and do not necessarily involve any reference to the moral worthiness of those who make greater efforts, wiser investments, and so on.

At other times however, the argument invokes a moral ideal holding desert valuable for its own sake. On this view, helping the undeserving and failing to help the deserving is deemed ''intrinsically'' unfair regardless of further consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arneson, Richard J. (1997), "Egalitarianism and the Undeserving Poor", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'' 5: 327-350, at pp. 330f.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the charge against Rawls is that people actually might deserve the gains flowing from their natural endowments, or at least those they achieve by striving conscientiously.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kernohan, Andrew (1993), "Desert and Self-Ownership", ''Journal of Value Inquiry'' 27: 197-202, at p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Professional responsibility}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''duty of confidentiality''' obliges [[solicitor]]s (or [[attorney at law|attorneys]]) to respect the confidentiality of their clients' affairs. Information that solicitors obtain about their clients' affairs may be confidential, and must not be used for the benefit of persons not authorized by the client. Confidentiality is a prerequisite for [[solicitor-client privilege|legal professional privilege]] to hold.

==The duty and its source==
The lawyer-client relationship has historically been characterised as one of confidence. This [[duty]] also constitutes part of the broader foundation for lawyer's [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to their clients.

===Rationales for the duty===
The maintenance of full and frank disclosure between lawyers and their clients is the main justification for the duty of confidentiality.  The basis for this rationale is [[utilitarianism]], in that it works to promote the work of solicitors, who are officers of the court.  It allows clients to freely discuss intimate details without fear that such information could be subsequently disclosed to the general public. In turn, public confidence in lawyers and the legal system is maintained and promoted. Further, the duty of confidentiality is a constant reminder to lawyers of the loyalty they owe to their clients.

Another rationale is to protect the [[human dignity]] of the client.

In criminal cases, confidentiality is also justified to prevent the use of tricked [[Confession (law)|confession]]s or [[admission (law)|admission]]s.

===Source of the duty===
The duty is sourced from a combination of [[contract law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]] arising from the distinctive relationship between lawyer and client. The solicitor or attorney is an agent of the client under the [[Agency (law)|law of agency]].  In contract, the duty arises from terms contained in the [[retainer agreement]]. Complementarily, equity prohibits unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information. In most jurisdictions, the duty is codified in the terms of legal professional rules, such as the [[Model Code of Professional Responsibility]].

Although the duty of confidentiality and fiduciary duties have common origins, they cannot be equated as not all fiduciary duties attract duties of confidentiality and vice versa.

==Scope of the duty==
===In contract===
As the lawyer-client duty of confidentiality is primarily sourced in contract law, the wording of implied terms in the retainer agreement determines its scope of operation. Despite its importance, there have been few judicial attempts to resolve the extent of the implied term.

===In equity===
In equity, protection is attached to information that is capable of meeting the test of confidentiality - whether the information was already public knowledge and whether its communication was for a ''limited purpose''. While this test may indicate a more limited scope of confidentiality under equity, by requiring information to be deemed confidential before  falling under the scope, on another level equity may secure a broader temporal protection for confidential information. The duty under contract expires on termination of the legal retainer, whereas the duty under equity remains intact until the information is no longer confidential, which may occur long after the expiration of the contractual retainer.

===In professional rules===
Legal professional rules have tended to adopt the broad view of the scope of duty recognised in contract law. The obligation to retain information in confidence, according to the professional rules in [[Australia]]n jurisdictions is premised on its connection with the legal retainer rather than the source of the information. Hence, the professional rules seem to imply that information gained in connection with the legal retainer is deemed confidential. However, though the rules emphasise the importance of the duty of confidentiality, this is not a hard rule. Not all information connected with the retainer meets the legal test of  confidentiality. The duty of confidence applies to "any information, which is confidential to a client and acquired by [a] practitioner or [a] practitioner's firm during the client's engagement." For barristers, it is "confidential information obtained by [a] barrister concerning any person."

===Compared to legal professional privilege===
Though the duty of confidentiality shares a common origin, goals, and similarities with legal professional privilege, they are distinct in at least three ways. Firstly, privilege is not dependent on a contractual, equitable or professional duty to clients. Rather, it is based upon arguments of public policy. Secondly, communications protected by confidentiality are more numerous than those protected by privilege. Privileged communications are a subset of confidential communication. Nonetheless, loss of privilege does not necessarily automatically destroy the duty to confidentiality if it has arisen independently of the privilege. Finally, privileged information is protected from compulsory disclosure, unless abrogated by statute or waived. Non-privileged confidential information on the other hand must be disclosed to judicial, statutory, or other legal compulsion. In particular, the public interest in discovering the truth trumps private duties to respect confidence.

==Limits and exceptions to the duty==
Though the duty to confidentiality is often expressed in absolute terms in professional rules, there are circumstances where the duty can be breached. The breach of the duty in certain contexts is justified through the balancing of the often competing interests of the client and proper administration of justice

===Client authorization===
As lawyer-client confidentiality exists for the benefit of the client, the confidence is the client's to waive or modify. Hence, the lawyer can reveal confidential information to third parties where the client allows such an action. However, consent to allow the disclosure of confidential information does not entitle the lawyer to disclose or use the information for other purposes than those specified by the client.

The authorization does not necessarily have to be explicit. It can be inferred from the terms or nature of the retainer agreement. The idea that all information imparted within a retainer is confidential is impracticable. Often, much of that information is communicated so that it can be disclosed to dispose of a matter, claim, or legal issue. Hence, where information is incidental to the conduct of a retainer, client authorisation can be generally taken as given. Nonetheless, where there is uncertainty, express authority should be sought from the client.

===Disclosure compelled by law===
Where expressly provided for in statute, lawyers must comply with any parliamentary requirement necessitating breach of the duty to confidentiality. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Parry-Jones v Law Society''&lt;ref&gt;''Parry-Jones v Law Society'' [1969] 1 Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; said at 6-7:

:"the solicitor must obey the law, and, in particular, he must comply with the rules made under the authority of statute for the conduct of the profession. If the rules require him to disclose his client's affairs, then he must do so."

Statutory abrogation of the duty is limited in scope and purpose however. Requirements are never blanket decrees for the revelation of confidential information. Rather they are based on upholding the public interest, where such interests override client interests in maintaining confidentiality.

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness - a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such actions.

===Disclosure of information that is not confidential===
Clearly, information that is not confidential does not fall under the duty of confidentiality. Disclosure of information that is already in the public domain does not breach the duty. Further, information that was not in the public knowledge at the time of the retainer agreement, is not subject to the duty if it subsequently enters the public domain. The purpose served by maintaining the confidence - the protection of the client - is arguably extinguished.

Nonetheless, the lawyer still owes a duty of loyalty, and clients may feel betrayed if such information is disclosed, even if it becomes public knowledge. Though there are no legal ramifications for disclosure, discretion on part of the lawyer may be in the long term interests of maintaining the propriety of the legal profession.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{seealso|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]].  Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] are no longer secret for the purpose of proving the Will is the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]].  In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the Will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

'''''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''''' is a 1984 book by the American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], in which Dennett discusses the [[philosophy|philosophical]] issues of [[free will]] and [[determinism]].

In 1983, Dennett delivered the [[John Locke lectures|John Locke Lectures]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on the topic of [[free will]]. In 1984, these ideas were published in the book ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. In this book Daniel Dennett explored what it means for people to have free will. The title, ''Elbow Room'', is a reference to the question: are we deterministic machines with no real freedom of action or do we in fact have some elbow room, some real [[rational choice theory|choice]] in our behavior?

==Synopsis==

===Determinism doesn't make humans equivalent to animals===
A major task taken on by Dennett in ''Elbow Room'' is to clearly describe just what people are as [[biology|biological]] entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance. In discussing what people are and why free will matters to us, Dennett makes use of an [[evolution]]ary perspective. Dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger [[wasp]] ''[[Sphex]]''. This insect follows a series of [[Genetics|genetically]] programmed steps in preparing for egg laying. If an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again. For an animal like a wasp, this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely, the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on. This is the type of mindless, pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid. Given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly, people can notice the futility of it, and by an act of free will do something else. We can take this as an [[operational definition]] of what people mean by free will. Dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility, most people have seen enough of the free will issue. Dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue.

From a biological perspective, what is the difference between the wasp and a person? The person can, through interaction with his/her environment, construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy. The wasp, with a much smaller brain and different genetic program, does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program. It is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that Dennett says we have free will.

===Both determinism and indeterminism seem to rule out free will===
The deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a [[paradox]]. On one hand, we all feel like we have free will, a multitude of behavioral choices to select among. On the other hand, modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps. How do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be [[mechanics|mechanical]] components of a mechanical [[universe]]?

What about [[determinism]]? When we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice? Do people just (through the action of their more complex brains) simply have better behaviors than wasps, while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors? Dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one: ''All physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events''. This definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged: if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future? Since we have no way of performing this experiment, this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question. Modern day physics-oriented philosophers have sometimes tried to answer the question of free will using the [[many-worlds interpretation]], according to which every time there is [[quantum indeterminacy]] each possibility occurs and new universes branch off. Since the 1920s, physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will. Dennett suggests that this idea is silly. How, he asks, can random resolutions of quantum-level events provide people with any control over their behavior?

===Indeterminism is not a solution to the free will problem===
Since Dennett wrote ''Elbow Room'' (1984) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice. Dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Control is the kind of freedom "worth wanting"===
Dennett discusses many types of free will (1984). Many philosophers have claimed that determinism and free will are [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatible]]. What the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor, or if there are multiple universes, to choose among the possible universes. Dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will, a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time. Dennett is able to accept determinism and free will at the same time. How so?

===We have free will===
The type of free will that Dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book: the power to be active agents, biological devices that respond to our environment with [[rationalism|rational]], desirable courses of action. Dennett has slowly, through the course of the book, stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will. How can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice? Dennett emphasizes control over [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]]. If our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us, then do we really need such choice? Is an [[illusion]] of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices? Is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion?  Dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense: that because we base our decisions on context, we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific.  In the most specific circumstance (actual events), he suggests there is only one option left to us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

:"It is this contrast between the stable and the chaotic that grounds our division of the world into the enduring and salient features of the world, and those features that we must treat statistically or probabilistically. And this division of the world is not just our division; it is, for instance, mother nature's division as well. Since for all mother nature knows (or could know) it is possible that these insects will cross paths (sometime, somewhere) with insectivorous birds, they had better be designed with some avoidance machinery. This endows them with a certain power that will serve well (in general)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-04077-8|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determinism does not rule out moral responsibility===
If people are determined to act as they do, then what about personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]? How can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave? Dennett gives a two-part answer to this question:

First, we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way. Second, holding people responsible only works when combined with the fact that people can be informed of the fact that they are being held responsible and respond to this state of affairs by controlling their behavior so as to avoid punishment. People who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can, but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions, people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment. This is a totally [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the issue of responsibility. Expressing [[morality|moral]] indignation when people break the rules of proper behaviour is only useful to the extent that it contributes to dissuading such behaviour. Again, an argument from utility. Is it, then, moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule? Yes, people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them. We would be worse off if we did not do so. Again, an argument from utility.

===Fatalism is destructive===
One final issue: if people do not have real behavioral choices, why not collapse into [[fatalism]]? Again, Dennett's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice, but we do have control of our behavior. Dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask, can I even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own? For Dennett, the answer to this question is, no, not really. In ''Elbow Room'', he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have tried to make to prove that people have [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]] have failed and are, in the final analysis, not really important anyhow. As humans, we are as much in control of our behavior as anything in the universe. As humans, we have the best chance to produce good behavior. We should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will.

Some complaints about ''Elbow Room'' relate to our intuitions about free will. Some say{{Who|date=January 2015}} that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.

An '''emblem''' is an [[abstract art|abstract]] or representational pictorial [[image]] that represents a [[concept]], like a [[moral]] [[truth]], or an [[allegory]], or a person, like a king or [[saint]].&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Oxford English Dictionary (OED2) | place = United Kingdom | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1989 | url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/symbol | isbn = 0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblems vs. symbols==
Although the words ''emblem'' and ''[[symbol]]'' are often used interchangeably, an emblem is a pattern that is used to represent an [[idea]] or an individual. An emblem crystallizes in concrete, visual terms some abstraction: a deity, a tribe or nation, or a virtue or vice.{{Clarify| reason=In which discipline is this distinction done? Is it an elementary notion in such field? As the previous sentence says (as everyone knows) emblem and symbols are interchangeable casually.| date=January 2013}}

An emblem may be worn or otherwise used as an identifying [[badge]] or [[Embroidered patch|patch]]. For example, in America, police officers' badges refer to their personal metal emblem whereas their woven emblems on uniforms identify members of a particular unit. A real or metal cockle shell, the emblem of [[St James the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;James the Apostle]], sewn onto the hat or clothes, identified a medieval pilgrim to his shrine at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. In the Middle Ages, many saints were given emblems, which served to identify them in paintings and other images: [[Catherine of Alexandria|St.&amp;nbsp;Catherine]] had a wheel, or a sword, [[St Anthony the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;Anthony Abbot]], a pig and a small bell. These are also called '''attributes''', especially when shown carried by or close to the saint in art. Kings and other grand persons increasingly adopted [[personal device]]s or emblems that were distinct from their family [[heraldry]]. The most famous include [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV of France]]'s sun, the [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] of [[Francis&amp;nbsp;I of France]], the [[boar]] of [[Richard&amp;nbsp;III of England]] and the [[armillary sphere]] of [[Manuel&amp;nbsp;I of Portugal]].  In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, there was a fashion, started in Italy, for making large [[medal]]s with a portrait head on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] and the emblem on the reverse; these would be given to friends and as [[diplomatic gift]]s. [[Pisanello]] produced many of the earliest and finest of these.

A symbol, on the other hand, substitutes one thing for another, in a more concrete fashion:&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;
* The [[Christian cross]] is a symbol of the [[Crucifixion]]; it is an emblem of sacrifice.
* The [[Red Cross]] is one of three symbols representing the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/emblem-history |title=The History of the Emblems |accessdate=2009-05-29 |date=2006-03-14 }} History of the emblems of the International Red Cross: An account of this organisation's need to adopt an emblem to represent itself, and the factors which led to it eventually adopting a second (the red crescent) and third (the red crystal).&lt;/ref&gt; A red cross on a white background is the emblem of [[humanitarian spirit]].

==Other terminology==
A [[totem]] is specifically an animal emblem that expresses the spirit of a [[clan]]. [[Heraldry]] knows its emblems as [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s. The [[lion passant]] serves as the emblem of England, the [[lion rampant]] as the emblem of [[Scotland]].

An [[icon]] consists of an image (originally a religious image), that has become standardized by convention. A [[logo]] is an impersonal, secular icon, usually of a [[corporation|corporate entity]].

== Emblems in history ==
Since the 15th century the terms of emblem (''emblema''; from {{lang-el|ἔμβλημα}}, meaning "embossed ornament") and emblematura belong to the ''termini technici'' of [[architecture]]. They mean an [[icon]]ic painted, drawn, or sculptural representation of a concept affixed to houses and belong—like the inscriptions—to the architectural ornaments (ornamenta). Since the publication of 
''De Re Aedificatoria'' (1452, Ten Books of Architecture),[8] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472), patterned after the ''De architectura'' by the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], ''emblema'' are related to Egyptian hieroglyphics and are considered as being the lost universal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Raybould | first = Robin | authorlink = Robin Raybould | title = An Introduction to the Symbolic Literature of the Renaissance | publisher = [[friedman Publishing]] | year = 2005 | pages = 170 | isbn = 9781412053112 | quote = {{ISBN|1-4120-5311-0}}}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the emblems belong to the Renaissance knowledge of antiquity which comprises not only Greek and Roman antiquity but also Egyptian antiquity as proven by the numerous [[obelisk]]s built in 16th and 17th century Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/skull-and-crossboneshttp://www.romeartlover.it/Obelisks.html |title=Obelisks of Rome |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Piperno |first=Roberto |editor=Rosamie Moore}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Historical information, a map, photographs, and descriptions of Egyptian obelisks in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1531 publication in Augsburg of the first [[emblem book]], the ''[[Emblemata]]'' of the Italian jurist [[Andrea Alciato]] launched a fascination with emblems that lasted two centuries and touched most of the countries of western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/ |title=Alciato's Book of Emblems: The Memorial Web Edition in Latin and English |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Barker |first=William |author2=Mark Feltham |author3=Jean Guthrie |date=1995-10-26}} This page states that "Andrea Alciato's [Emblemata] had enormous influence and popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries".&lt;/ref&gt; "Emblem" in this sense refers to a didactic or moralizing combination of picture and text intended to draw the reader into a self-reflective examination of his or her own [[personal life|life]]. Complicated associations of emblems could transmit information to the culturally-informed viewer, a characteristic of the 16th-century artistic movement called [[Mannerism]].

A popular collection of emblems, which ran to many editions, was presented by [[Francis Quarles]] in 1635. Each of the emblems consisted of a paraphrase from a passage of Scripture, expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, followed by passages from the Christian Fathers, and concluding with an [[epigram]] of four lines. These were accompanied by an emblem that presented the symbols displayed in the accompanying passage.

== Emblems in speech ==
Emblems are certain gestures which have a specific meaning attached to them. These meanings usually are associated with the culture they are established in. Using emblems creates a way for humans to communicate with one another in a non-verbal way. An individual waving their hand at a friend, for example, would communicate "hello" without having to verbally say anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KaZYCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nonverbal Communication|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780205525003|edition=1st|pages=432|last1=Burgoon, Guerrero, Floyd|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emblems vs. sign language ===
Although sign language uses hand gestures to communicate words in a non-verbal way, it should not be confused with emblems. Sign language contains linguistic properties, similar to those used in verbal languages, and is used to communicate entire conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Distinguishing the Processing of Gestures from Signs in Deaf Individuals: An fMRI Study|last1=Res|first1=Brain|pmc=2693477|pmid=19397900|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2009.04.034|volume=1276|journal=Brain Res|pages=140–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic properties are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, etc...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/7/1766.full.pdf|title=On the Universal Structure of Human Lexical Semantics|last1=Youn|first1=Hyejin|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with sign language, emblems are a non-linguistic form of communication. Emblems are single gestures which are meant to get a short non-verbal message to another individual.

== Emblems in culture ==
Emblems are associated with the culture they are established in and are subjective to that said culture. For example, the OK sign used in America to communicate "OK" in a non-verbal way, also means “O” in the state of France. The same OK sign means "money" in the country of Japan, and in some European countries the OK sign means something sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwhZOxI11QMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Academic+Encounters+Level+4+Student%27s+Book+Reading+and+Writing:+Human+Behavior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrlY6I4dnTAhVDKCYKHcldCtIQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Academic%20Encounters%20Level%204%20Student's%20Book%20Reading%20and%20Writing%3A%20Human%20Behavior&amp;f=false|title=Academic Encounters Level 4 Student's Book Reading and Writing: Human Behavior|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last1=Seal|first1=Bernard|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the thumbs up sign in America means "good job or good luck", but in some parts of the Middle East the thumbs up sign means something highly offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.busuu.com/what-hand-gestures-mean-in-different-countries/|title=What Hand Gestures Mean In Different Countries|website=Busuu Logo|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">'''Environmental peacebuilding''' examines and advocates environmental protection and cooperation as a factor in peaceful relations. Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.

==Peacebuilding==

The study of [[peacebuilding]] (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. 1975.  "Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding." In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304. Copenhagen:  Christian Ejlers.&lt;/ref&gt; develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.  Lederach&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul.  Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press) 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly cited, and his work has influenced national aid and development agencies, international agencies, and the network of NGOs that have placed peacebuilding on their agendas.  

Beginning with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promoting An Agenda for Peace in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;UN Secretary-General. 1992. "An Agenda for peace: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping." UN Doc. A/47/277. June 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations adopted the language of peacebuilding and developed programs based on it.  Initiatives promoting human security and human rights share a similar concern with developing an international system that promotes the underlying conditions for the movement towards a peaceful world.

==Environmental peacebuilding==

Within the field of peacebuilding studies and practice, there is a sub-literature on environmental peacebuilding that examines the role of environmental factors in moving towards a sustainable peace.  At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carius, A.

They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.

==Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==

The 1991 Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the USSR, brought together representatives of the governments of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation within the Jordanian delegation.  The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable 
Middle East peace.    

The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation – not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  

Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Stuart.  2010.

(2008). Regional Water Cooperation and Peacebuilding in the Middle East.  Adelphi Research, Initiative For Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==
===Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information===
[[Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information|IPCRI]] opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.  IPCRI established the Water and Environment division in 1992.  A 1993 edited book presented Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on water cooperation.  Three IPCRI workshops held between 1994-6 on "Our Shared Environment" were followed by three volumes of papers from the workshops.  The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International "Water for Life" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. 

Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the [[trans-boundary river|trans-boundary]] Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.  IPCRI is a partner in the "GLOWA Jordan River" study of the impact of climate change on the Jordan basin, and has undertaken, with the support of the Government of Japan, work designed to provide a model for low cost sanitation to a West Bank village.

===EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East===
[[Friends of the Earth Middle East|EcoPeace / FoEME]] was founded in 1994 as a meeting place for Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli environmental NGOs and became an affiliate of Friends of the Earth in 1998.  FOEME has a wide range of projects – organized around particular geographic areas (the Jordan River valley, the Dead Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba / Eilat), water (Good Water Neighbors, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Conduit, the mountain aquifer, "water, peace and the environment," water privatization), and environmental policy (sustainable development, climate change, "violent conflicts and the environment," trade and environment, solar power and healthy food).  FoEME has promoted protection rather than development of the Dead Sea and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, advocated the establishment of a "peace park" along the Jordan River, and vigorously questioned the proposed mega-project to channel water from the Read Sea to the Dead Sea.  

Since 2001 the FoEME Good Water Neighbors project has been working with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian communities that are mutually dependent on shared water resources.  Each community is partnered with a neighboring community.  Good Water Neighbors works with local community members on water education, awareness and development.  GWN uses dependence on shared water sources as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between partnered communities.

FoEME has published its own study of environmental peacebuilding,&lt;ref&gt;Harari, N., &amp; Roseman, J. (2008).  Environmental Peacebuilding Theory and Practice: A Case Study of the Good Water Neighbours Project and In Depth Analysis of the Wadi Fukin / Tzur Hadassah Communities. EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; and circulates a monthly "environmental peacemaking" listserv.

===Arava Institute for Environmental Studies===
The [[Arava Institute for Environmental Studies|institute]] opened in the 1996-7 academic year.  For one or two semesters students from Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt and overseas live and study together on Kibbutz Ketura (in a remote part of the Negev desert south of the West Bank and just across the valley from Jordan) and receive university credit.&lt;ref&gt;Alleson, Ilan and Stuart Schoenfeld.  2007. 	"Environmental Justice and Peacebuilding in the Middle East," Peace Review 19:371-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolment, which is capped at 45, has varied.  From 1996 to 2010, about 600 students have studied at the institute.  University credit is now received through Ben Gurion University, and the institute co-sponsors a Master's program with Ben Gurion, in which some of its alumni have studied.

The alumni division maintains active Yahoo and Facebook "groups."  Alumni involvement is supplemented by  the Arava Alumni Peace and Environment Network (AAPEN) which held its first meeting in Aqaba in 2005 and has held subsequent meetings and other activities.  The institute has also developed as a research center.  The institute participates in projects as partners with Palestinian and Jordanian researchers and research organizations.  These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.

'''Equality feminism''' is a subset of the overall [[feminism]] movement that focuses on the basic similarities between men and women, and whose ultimate goal is the equality of the sexes in all domains.  This includes economic and political equality, equal access within the workplace, freedom from oppressive gender stereotyping, and an androgynous worldview.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;Stanford University. [http://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/terms/feminism.html Gendered Innovations]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Feminist theory seeks to promote the legal status of women as equal and undifferentiated from that of men. While equality feminists largely agree that men and women have basic biological differences in anatomy and frame, they argue that on a psychological level, the use of ration or reason is androgynous. For equality feminists, men and women are equal in terms of their ability to reason, achieve goals, and prosper in both the work and home front.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this entire paragraph|date=February 2018}}

Equality feminism was the dominant version of feminism following [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792). Wollstonecraft made the case that women's equality to men manifests itself in education and worker's rights, and further produced a proverbial roadmap in order for future women to follow in terms of activism and feminist theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, active equality feminist include [[Simone de Beauvoir]], the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] Leaders, [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Coffin Mott]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].

While equality feminism was the dominant perspective of feminism during the 19th and 20th century, the 1980s and 1990s brought about a new focus in popular feminism on [[difference feminism]], or the essential differences between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;The University of Alabama. [http://www.uah.edu/woolf/feminism_kinds.htm "Kinds of Feminism"]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to equality feminism, this view advocates for the celebration of the "feminine" by focusing on traditionally viewed female traits, such as empathy, nurturing, and care. While equality feminists view human nature as essentially androgynous, difference feminists claim that this viewpoint aligns the "good" with male-dominated stereotypes, thus sticking within the patriarchal framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/care-eth/ Ethics of Care] (International Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

== History ==

In both law and in theology women were portrayed as both physically and intellectually inferior.  One of the first feminist documents that set the stage for feministic movements occurred when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in 1792.  While this literature was seen as rebellious at the time it echoed the feelings of women throughout [[France]] as women's republican clubs demanded that liberty, equality and fraternity should be applied to both men and women.  While this movement gained notoriety it was eventually extinguished by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Code Napoleon that established that the husband had complete control over the family and regressed equality feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, Joan B. Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1988. Retrieved 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the equality feminism movements that occurred in France weren't successful, they influenced much of the movements that occurred in North America in the 1800s.  Both [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]] fought for woman's emancipation to be included in the constitution of 1776 to no avail.  However, Elizabeth Cade Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, along with thousands of other women changed the dynamics of equality feminism forever with the women's convention at Seneca Falls N.Y. in 1848.  Here along with independence they demanded full legal equality in all aspects of life (education, commercial opportunities, compensation, voting rights, etc.).  With the influence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, this movement evolved into Europe.  In 1869 [[John Stuart Mill]] published ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' in which he argued that equality between the sexes would translate to more moral and intellectual advancement which in turn would result in more human happiness to everyone.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|87–89}}

After the expansion into Europe, the movement stifled its growth until 1920 where the [[woman suffrage]] movement occurred, as many women were divided when determining whether or not women were on equal standing with men.  This continued until the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] was established in 1946 to secure equal political, economic and educational opportunities for women throughout the world.  In 1949, a French Existentialist Simone de Beauvoir published the work ''[[The Second Sex]]'', in which she debunks many of the claims made towards women and fights for gender equality.  In 1963 another literature pertaining to equality feminism arose, with Betty Friedan's ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' in which she discussed "the problem that has no name", being the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique." The Essential Feminist Reader. Ed. Estelle B. Freedman. New York: Random House Group, 2007. Retrieved 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  She uses this information to describe many of the gender inequalities that society has created that has resulted in this unhappiness, such as giving up her psychology career to tend to her children.  Using these literatures as a guide feminism once again arose in the United States with the development of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) formed in 1966. This organization fought for the removal of all legal and social barriers placed upon women to once again influence true equality between men and women.  In 1972 women leaders such as [[Bella Abzug]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]] pushed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] through Congress; however, it fell short of ratification by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Ginette.

== Equality feminist theory ==

Equality feminist theory is the extension of the equality of the male and female into theoretical and philosophical fields of thought. At its core, equality feminist theory advocates for the equal standing of both men and women in terms of desires, wants, goals, and achievement. Thus, from this viewpoint, the basis of human nature outside of culture is androgynous, neutral, and equal.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Much of equality feminism focuses on the relation of reason as the central tenet of both men and women equally. Mary Wollstonecraft in "A Vindication on the Rights of Women" (1792) claimed that women should enjoy the same legal and political rights as men on the grounds that they are human beings. Specifically, Wollstonecraft argues for "[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for".&lt;ref name=WM&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt A Vindication of the Rights of Women]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} In this way, both men and women should have equal access to rights because they have an equal access to the capacity to reason. Similarly, ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869), [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated that society ought to be arranged according to reason and that 'accidents of birth' is irrelevant. Thus, because both men and women are governed by principles of reason, then the biological elements such as sex, gender, and race aren't contributing factors to the essence of the individual. Mill notes that within a patriarchal society, "Men hold women in subjection by representing to them meekness, submissiveness resignation of all individual will into the hands of a man as an essential part of sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, John Stuart and Okin, Susan Moller. [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_subjection_of_women.html?id=PK_BGGCU_dsC ''The Subjection of Women'']. Hacking Publishing, 1998. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–127}} In this way, to say that women have essential characteristics of submission by nature of their sex is an oppressive measure that contradicts the basic principle of reason that governs all human nature.

== Important figures ==

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
In 1792 Wollstonecraft wrote one of the earliest works in feminist philosophy and though she doesn't explicitly state that men and women are equal she does call for equality in various realms of life which set the stage for future equality feminist works. In her piece ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects'', Wollstonecraft argues that women should have an education comparable to their position in society.  She articulates her argument by claiming that since women were the primary care givers they could be able to better educate their own children and be seen as "companions" to the husband rather than wives if they were given this opportunity.  Instead of being considered "property" that were exchanged through marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that women are human beings and therefore deserve equal fundamental rights as men.&lt;ref name=WM/&gt;{{rp|74–88}}

===John Stuart Mill===
In 1869, John Stuart Mill with the help of his wife [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] published ''The Subjection of Women'', in it he argued for equality between the sexes.  John Stuart Mill was able to draw off of some of the arguments his wife made in her essay ''The Enfranchisement of Women'', in which she opened the door of favoring equality for both men and women.  Mill believe that the moral and intellectual advancement from giving women the opportunity to be considered equal would translate to greater happiness for everyone involved.  He believed that all humans had the capability of being educated and civilized, with which he argued women should be given the right to vote.  Throughout the book Mill continues to argue that both men and women should be able to vote to defend their rights and be able to have the opportunity to stand on their own two feet morally and intellectually, and constantly used his position in Parliament to advocate for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mills (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)". plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 30 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill attacks many of the arguments that women are inferior at certain activities and therefore be forbidden from doing them by saying that women aren't given the opportunities and therefore we don't know what women are capable of.  He claims that males are making an authoritative statement without evidence, an argument solely based on speculation.  Mill claims that by giving women this opportunity to figure out exactly what they were capable of would double the mass of mental faculties to serve humanity, and could produce a great impact on human development.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|56–79}}

===Simone de Beauvoir===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] played a large role in equality feminism with the publishing of her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'', broken into 3 parts.  In the first part, "Destiny", de Beauvoir discusses the relationship of male to female in a variety of creatures before comparing human beings.  This physiological data along with psychoanalytical data help her come to the conclusion that there wasn't a historical defeat of the female sex.  Part two, "History", outlines the two factors in the evolution of women's condition: participation in production and freedom from reproductive slavery.  In these chapters, de Beauvoir compares being a women to being like an animal, similar to the way male animals dominated a female.  Finally in part three, "Myths", de Beauvoir discusses the perceived "everlasting disappointment" of women from a male heterosexual point of view.  She then comes back and discusses full reality of the situation to show the discrepancies between perception and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone De. ''The Second Sex''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her literary career, de Beauvoir helped unravel some of the "myths" associated with perceptions in gender and set forth a strong message that men and women should be treated equal with equal rights.

===Betty Friedan===
[[Betty Friedan]] became one of the most recognized equality feminists after writing the book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', in which she discusses "the problem that has no name", female unhappiness in the 1950s and 1960s.  It was through this book that Friedman was able to address many of the problems and the widespread recognition allowed her to later become president of the [[National Organization for Women]](NOW).  

Throughout the piece Friedan addressed the problem that women had "wanting more than a husband, children, and a home".  Friedan discusses the societal expectations of raising children and how this caused many women to not be able to do what they wanted.  Many decisions that were made for women were made by men and this had worn out many women.  She discusses the problem of education and that many families solely focused on education for the male children and women were instead "assigned to be married to fulfill child-bearing expectations".&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;  It was through the impact of this piece of literature that women were finally given a voice to say it was okay to not want to conform to societal expectations and fight for equality of opportunities, choices, marriage, education, and voting.

== Objections ==

The main objection raised to equality feminism comes in the form of [[difference feminism]], the belief that emphasizes the differences between men and women. This viewpoint, as championed by such feminists such as [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Joan Tronto]], [[Eva Feder Kittay]], [[Genevieve Lloyd]], [[Alison Jaggar]], and Ynestra King, developed out of the rejection of the androgynous view of human nature as emphasized in equality feminism. Begun largely in the 1980s, this viewpoint makes the case that equality feminism fails to account for the uniquely female experience, and thus creates the male perspective as the dominant aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley,Victoria L.

[[Image:Icehockeyfight.jpg|thumb|A fight during a junior league ice hockey game between [[Frölunda HC]] and [[VIK Västerås HK]]]]
'''Fighting in ice hockey''' is an established tradition of [[Ice hockey|the sport]] in North America, with a long history that involves many levels of [[amateur sports|amateur]] and [[Professional sports|professional]] play and includes some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting is usually performed by [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]], or "goons"—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]], [[Official (ice hockey)|officials]], and the media refer to as "the code".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights.

Unique among North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"/&gt; (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as [[Checking (ice hockey)|checking]] and prohibited techniques such as [[elbowing]], [[high-sticking]], and [[Cross-checking (hockey)|cross-checking]], is linked to fighting.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"/&gt; The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Should The NHL Ban Fighting In Hockey? |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/sports/nhl-ban-fighting-hockey/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20070327/282213711371635|title=Fighting part of hockey: Bettman: Canucks players agree with commissioner about the role of fisticuffs|last=McIntyre|first=Gordon|date=27 March 2007|access-date=27 March 2017|journal=[[The Province|The Vancouver Province]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fans and players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question &gt; Should Fighting Be Completely Banished?|publisher=2011/12 Player Poll|url=http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222131442/http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games,&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{cite news | author = Barrie Examiner | title = Keep fighting, hockey fans say | journal =Barrie Examiner | date = 5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.

Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century Canada.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; The implementation of some features, such as the [[Hockey rink|blue lines]] in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or "[[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]]" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Types of penalties|five-minute major penalty]]. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; Promoters such as [[Tex Rickard]] of [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], who also promoted [[boxing]] events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to "fisticuffs" has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 46 in the NHL rulebook. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2010–11|publisher=National Hockey League|year=2010|pages=69–74|url=http://www.nhl.com/league/ext/rules/2010-2011_Rulebook.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Mike|title=NHL to adopt penalty for removing visor in fight|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|date=19 June 2013|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-to-implement-a-minor-penalty-for-players-that-remove-their-visors-prior-to-fighting/|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Kahane160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it "was probably more like [[Rugby football|rugby]] on skates than it was modern hockey."&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the [[Original Six]] era, when fewer teams existed than in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=History of fighting in hockey|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/history-of-fighting-in-hockey/|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[1967 NHL expansion|NHL's expansion]] in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruin]]s and [[St. Louis Blues]] in 1969, Bruins defenceman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of Hockey — NHL Player Search — Player — Wayne Maki|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[World Hockey Association]] [[Birmingham Bulls]] enforcer [[Dave Hanson (ice hockey)|Dave Hanson]], known for his 11-year professional career, fought [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bobby Hull]] and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles.

Many teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights in the 1990s included the [[Red Wings – Avalanche brawl|Brawl in Hockeytown]] in 1997, in which the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]] engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Goaltender|goalies]] [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkak|first=Ashley|title=17 Years Later, A Look Back At The Greatest Fight In Red Wings History|publisher=[[WWJ-TV]]|date=26 March 2014|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/17-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-greatest-fight-in-red-wings-history/|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders [[Chris Osgood]] and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL Recap (Colorado-Detroit)|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2 April 1998|accessdate = 30 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619203307/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|archivedate=19 June 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Maaddi | first=Rob | title = Flyers bully Senators in 5-3 victory | work = USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/games/2004-03-06-philly-ottawa_x.htm | accessdate = 15 April 2007 | date=6 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.&lt;ref name="decline"/&gt;

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the "Third Man In" rule which attempts to eliminate the [[bench-clearing brawl]] by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the "Instigator" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight,&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|title=Fighting in Hockey: A Timeline|date=27 February 2009|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304123020/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|archivedate=4 March 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and penalties==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Frölunda Västerås U18 Fight(2).jpg|thumb|right|A fight during a [[Frölunda HC]] – [[VIK Västerås HK]] game]] --&gt;
Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty.&lt;ref name="broke"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldschmied and Espindola|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.&lt;ref name="broke"/&gt;

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2006-11-23-notebook_x.htm |title=NHL suspends three players, fines two coaches for Caps-Thrashers melee |author=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American professional leagues===
[[Image:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] (left) fighting [[Wade Brookbank]] (right)]]
In the NHL, [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), [[ECHL]], [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

A player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

===Collegiate, European, and Olympic===
In Division I and Division III [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|pp=37–38, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=Rules against fighting in NCAA hockey don't deter cheap shots|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/rules-against-fighting-in-ncaa-hockey-dont-deter-cheap-shots/|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Match penalty (the player is ejected from the game and another player serves 5 minutes in addition to any other penalties imposed in the penalty box) for a player who starts fisticuffs.
* Minor penalty (2 minutes) for a player who retaliates with a blow or attempted blow.
* Game misconduct penalty (ejection from the game) in addition to any other penalties for any player who is the first to intervene in fisticuffs which are already in progress.
* Double minor penalty (4 minutes), major penalty and game misconduct penalty (5 minutes and ejection from the game), or match penalty (at the discretion of the referee) for a player who continues fisticuffs after being told by officials to stop.
* Misconduct penalty (10 minutes; second misconduct penalty in one game means automatic ejection) for a player who intentionally takes off his gloves in fisticuffs.

Despite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man [[Bench-clearing brawl|bench-clearing brawl]]. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers' coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 29 December 2006 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date=10 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 24 December 2007 | publisher = cbc.ca | date=14 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/other_sports/1171302.stm|title=BBC Sport – Other Sports – League punishes teams over brawl|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]] in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Lenta.ru | title = Матч КХЛ был сорван массовой дракой хоккеистов | url = http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/01/09/scuffle/ | accessdate = 9 January 2010 | publisher = lenta.ru | year = 2010 | language = Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/9/23770.html|title=This is hockey? |publisher=KHL.ru|date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.&lt;ref name="bothteamslose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/10/23771.html|title=Both teams lose|publisher=KHL.ru|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punch-up in Piestany]] was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987: Canada, USSR brawl at World Junior Hockey Tournament|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1987-punch-up-in-piestany|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcers==
{{Main article|Enforcer (ice hockey)}}
The role of "enforcer" on a hockey team is unofficial.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the [[pest (ice hockey)|pest]], who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wagenheim|first=Jeff|title=As NHL enforcers fade, tough guys will always be needed|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=14 October 2014|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2014/10/13/vanishing-enforcers-tough-guys-hockey-fights|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw "reaction penalties", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights often start in response to an opponent's rough play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game-related reasons===
[[Image:hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|right|A large fight in an [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] hockey game between the [[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Ottawa 67s]]]]

Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"/&gt; This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the late 1950s, [[Gordie Howe]] helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating [[Lou Fontinato]], a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Legends of Hockey | year = 2007 | title = Lou Fontinato | journal = Legends of Hockey | url = http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12622 | accessdate = 25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | year = 2007 | title = The ageless wonder | publisher = [[ESPN]] | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014262.html | accessdate = 7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"/&gt;

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason is the protection of star players. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by [[Dave Semenko]], [[Marty McSorley]], and others, and [[Brett Hull]], who was protected by [[Kelly Chase]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.&lt;ref name="scott20150115"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/bobby-farnham-pittsburgh-penguins-longform | title=The Ivy Leaguer who fought his way to the NHL | work=USA Today | date=15 January 2015 | accessdate=15 January 2015 | author=Scott, Nate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal reasons===
Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Farm team|farm systems]] that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.&lt;ref name="Botterill"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Botterill | first=Cal | year = 2004 | title = The Psychology of Professional Hockey | journal = Athletic Insight | publisher = University of Winnipeg | url = http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol6Iss2/ProfessionalHockey.htm | accessdate = 9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.{{r|scott20150115}}

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rivalry that produced many fights was between the [[National Hockey League rivalries#Colorado Avalanche vs. Detroit Red Wings|Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s]].&lt;ref name="Dater_Feud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dater|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on game==
Statistics indicate that fights are detrimental to teams' play, or have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about 1/80th of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.&lt;ref name="klein20120122"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/sports/hockey/flying-fists-dont-add-up-to-victories.html | title=Numbers Indicate That Skill Usually Packs a Bigger Punch Than Fists | work=The New York Times | date=22 January 2012 | accessdate=18 June 2012 | author=Klein, Jeff Z. | page=SP9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to ban fighting==
The Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in ''Position Statement'' in 1988 that "Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kissick|first=James|title=Position Statement: Violence and Injuries in Ice Hockey|publisher=Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine|year=2007|origyear=1988|url=http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122248/http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, [[Colton Orr]] of the [[New York Rangers]] fought with [[Todd Fedoruk]] of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with [[Derek Boogaard]]. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban.&lt;ref name="Dater"&gt;{{cite news | last=Dater | first=Adrian | title = Debate? Let's drop the gloves | journal = [[The Denver Post]] | url = http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5514998 | date = 25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue;&lt;ref name="Lebrun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Lebrun | first=Pierre | title = Fighting the good fight | journal = [[Edmonton Sun]] | date = 24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey.&lt;ref name="Dater"/&gt; Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]], have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.&lt;ref name="Naylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Naylor | first=David | title = Fight On? | journal = The Globe and Mail | date = 23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike,&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=P. | title = Hockey brawls ruin a once grand game | journal = [[Windsor Star]] | date = 27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a "knee-jerk" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game,&lt;ref name="Jenkinson"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Jenkinson | first=Mike | title = NHL no place for fighting | journal = [[Ottawa Sun]] | date = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is simply a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gough | first=David | title = Fighting not necessary for hockey | journal = Courier Press (Wallaceburg, Ontario) | date = 4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Sport and Social Issues''' Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewinson and Palma|2012|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuc|first=Chris|title=Why is fighting vanishing from the NHL?|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=6 February 2016|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-hockey-fighting-fading-spt-0207-20160206-story.html|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, [[David Johnston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], said that fighting should not be part of the sport.&lt;ref name="govgen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/01/26/pol-gg-hockey-fighting-pnp.html | title=Fighting has no place in hockey, GG says | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=26 January 2012 | accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IIHF president [[Rene Fasel]] has protested against fighting, deeming it "[[Neanderthal]] behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeBrun|first=Pierre|title=Hockey community debates merits of fighting|work=The Globe and Mail|date=23 March 2007|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey-community-debates-merits-of-fighting/article1072626/|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Gretzky]], considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fisticuffs, although he expressed support for fighting in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burstyn|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, "Fighting has always had a role in the game&amp;nbsp;... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/03/26/bettman-figting.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=Fighting not up for debate: Bettman | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a [[school board]] trustee in [[London, Ontario]] attended a [[London Knights]] game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it.  This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"/&gt; On the advice of its [[Medical Health Officer]], the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Pollett | first=Graham L. | title = Correspondence | journal = Middlesex-London Health Unit | date = 9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the [[Whitby Dunlops]], a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's [[Major League Hockey]], died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/senior-player-dies-from-injury-sustained-in-on-ice-fight/|title=Senior Player Dies From Injury Sustained in On-Ice Fight|last=Hackel|first=Stu |author2=Klein, Jeff Z. |date=2 January 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/562096|title=Editorial: Fighting has no place in hockey|last=Bishop|first=Dr. Pat |date=6 January 2009|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|title=Hockey player's death prompts helmet questions|date=2 January 2009|work=The Hamilton Spectator|agency=Canadian Press|accessdate=7 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121194213/http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|archivedate=21 January 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighters such as [[Bob Probert]] and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a [[degenerative disease]] of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp "Derek Boogard - A Brain 'Going Bad'"], ''The New York Times'', 5 December 2011. Part 3 of a three-part series chronicling Boogard's life and the posthumous research on his brain. Retrieved 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt; His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt;

Beginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League will impose a fighting major counter, similar to the [[National Basketball Association]]'s unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer's accumulated cards.  A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors).  A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting.  If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theahl.com/board-of-governors-concludes-annual-meeting-p202959 |title=Board of Governors Concludes Annual Meeting|date=7 July 2016 |publisher=American Hockey League|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etiquette==
There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as granting a "free pass".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcer [[Darren McCarty]] described fighters as being divided into "heavyweights" and "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category "end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarty and Allen|2014|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not assaulting referees or linesmen.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.

==Tactics==
Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as "going for it", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]], was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time [[Buffalo Sabres]] enforcer [[Rob Ray]] to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the "Rob Ray Rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Jim|title=Ray: 'It's not something I planned'|publisher=ESPN|date=19 January 2004|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=1711851&amp;columnist=kelley_jim|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein_63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officials' role==
Throughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Chris|title=Report: NHL wants linesmen to break up more fights before they start|publisher=CBS Sports|date=15 October 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/report-nhl-wants-linesmen-to-break-up-more-fights-before-they-start/|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by "common sense", according to officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=NHL Fight Time Never Fun for Linesmen Who Must Restore Order|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 March 1988|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-26/sports/sp-206_1_fight|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together.  If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/OPM_English.pdf|title=Officiating Procedures Manual|accessdate=2 March 2009|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a multiple fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], there were commonly reckoned to be '''five wits''' and '''five senses'''.&lt;ref name=Furness1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=King Lear|title=Shakespeare|pages=187|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|isbn=9780742652866|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=5|edition=7th|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The five wits were sometimes taken to be synonymous with the five senses,&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&amp;nbsp;but were otherwise also known and regarded as the '''five inward wits''', distinguishing them from the five senses, which were the five ''outward'' wits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|article=wit|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|publisher=Merriam-Webster|date=1991|isbn=9780877796039|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Words|author=[[C. S. Lewis|Clive Staples Lewis]]|edition=2nd (republished)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=9780521398312|pages=147|chapter=Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this conflation has resulted from changes in meaning.  In [[Early Modern English]], "[[wikt:wit#English|wit]]" and "[[wikt:sense#English|sense]]" overlapped in meaning.  Both could mean a faculty of perception (although this sense dropped from the word "wit" during the 17th century).  Thus "five wits" and "five senses" could describe both groups of wits/senses, the inward and the outward, although the common distinction, where it was made, was "five wits" for the inward and "five senses" for the outward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early modern English|author=Charles Laurence Barber|pages=245|chapter=Changes of Meaning|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780748608355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward and outward wits are a product of many centuries of philosophical and psychological thought, over which the concepts gradually developed, that have their origins in the works of [[Aristotle]].  The concept of five outward wits came to medieval thinking from Classical philosophy, and found its most major expression in Christian [[devotional literature]] of the Middle Ages.  The concept of five inward wits similarly came from Classical views on psychology.

Modern thinking is that there are more than five (outward) senses, and the idea that there are five (corresponding to the gross anatomical features &amp;mdash; eyes, ears, nose, skin, and mouth &amp;mdash; of many higher animals) does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  (For more on this, see [[Sense|Definition of sense]].)  But the idea of five senses/wits from Aristotelian, medieval, and 16th century thought still lingers so strongly in modern thinking that a sense beyond the natural ones is still called a "sixth sense".&lt;ref name=Postgate&gt;{{cite book|title=The outer reaches of life|author=John Raymond Postgate|chapter=Microsenses|pages=165|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780521558730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "inward" wits ==
[[Stephen Hawes]]' poem ''Graunde Amoure'' shows that the five (inward) wits were "common wit", "imagination", "fantasy", "estimation", and "memory".&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  "Common wit" corresponds to Aristotle's concept of the ''[[sensus communis]]'', and "estimation" roughly corresponds to the modern notion of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1964), pp. 162, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare himself refers to these wits several times, in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (Act I, scene 4 and Act II, scene iv), ''[[King Lear]]'' (Act III, scene iv), ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (Act I, scene i, 55), and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act IV, scene ii, 92).&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  He distinguished between the five wits and the five senses, as can be seen from [[Sonnet 141]].&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backgrounds of Shakespeare's thought|author=John Erskine Hankins|publisher=Archon Books|year=1978|isbn=9780208017437|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mares /&gt;

The five wits are derived from the faculties of the soul that [[Aristotle]] describes in ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;ref name=Mares&gt;{{cite book|title=Much ado about nothing By William Shakespeare|author=Francis Hugh Mares|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521532501|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward wits are part of medieval psychological thought.  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] translated [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' into Middle English.  According to Chaucer's translation, "ymaginacioun" is the most basic internal faculty of perception.  One can, with the imagination, call to mind the image of an object, either one directly experienced or a purely imaginary fabrication.  Above that comes "resoun", by which such images of individual objects are related to the universal classes to which they belong.  Above that comes "intelligence", which relates the universal classes to eternal "symple forme" (akin to a [[Platonic ideal]]).  Humans are thus "sensible", "ymaginable", and "reasonable" (i.e. capable of sensing, imagination, and reason, as defined), all three of which feed into memory.  (Intelligence is the sole remit of Divine Providence.)&lt;ref name=Kolve&gt;{{cite book|title=Chaucer and the Imagery of Narrative|author=V. A. Kolve|pages=20&amp;ndash;22|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1984|isbn=0-8047-1349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To that quartet is also added "phantasia", a creative facet of imagination.  A famous example of this is given by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who distinguishes between imagining [[Carthage]], from memory (since he had been there), and imagining [[Alexandria]], a pure fantasy image of a place that he had never been to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cook|volume=VII|location=London|publisher=Whitaker &amp;amp; Co.|year=1843|chapter=King Lear}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The five (outward) senses, as described in [[Cursor Mundi]], are "hering" (hearing), "sight", "smelling" (smell), "fele" (touch) and "cheuing" (taste).&lt;ref name=Postgate /&gt;  It relates them to the five Aristotelian elements (which Aristotle describes in ''[[On the Heavens|De Caelo]]''), with sight coming from fire, hearing from the upper air (the aether), smell from the lower air, taste from water, and touch from earth.  This definition of the origins of human senses was an exceedingly popular one throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, not least because of its rough agreement with chapter 30 of the [[Second Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Southern Version of Cursor Mundi: Lines 1-9228|editor=Sarah M. Horrall|pages=350|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=1978|isbn=9780776648057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "wit" to describe these five senses is illustrated by ''The World and the Chylde'' (at right) and the following two quotations:&lt;ref name=Furness2&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Romeo and Juliet|title=Shakespeare|pages=60|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|isbn=9780742652828|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=1|edition=10th|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|text=And this knowledge descendeth and cometh of the five corporal senses and wits of the persons, as the eyes, understanding, and hearing of the ears, smell of the nose, taste of the mouth, [&amp;hellip;]|sign=Larke|source=''Book of Wisdom''&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}
{{quote|text=My five wits have I fondly misused and spent, in hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and also feeling, which thou has given me [&amp;hellip;]|sign=''King Henry The Eighth's Primer'', 1546&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}

This definition of five senses has its origins in thinkers that came after Aristotle.  Aristotle himself, in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|De Sensu et Sensibilibus]]'' defined ''four'' senses: sight (associated with water because the eye contains water), sound (corresponding to air), smell (corresponding to fire), and touch (corresponding to earth).  Aristotle viewed taste as merely a specialized form of touch, which he in turn viewed as the primary sense (because all life-forms possess it).  He rejected the earlier view by [[Democritus]] that there was in fact only one sense, touch.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|title=Folk-taxonomies in early English|author=Earl R. Anderson|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|year=2003|isbn=9780838639160|chapter=The Five Senses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Plato]], in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', has Socrates stating that there are innumerable senses without names, and that the senses with names include hearing, sight, smell, senses of heat and cold, pleasure, pain, desire, and fear.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

[[Aulus Gellius]] defined five senses, saying "Ex quinque his sensibus quose animantibus natura tribit, visu, auditu, gustu, tactu, odoratu, quas Graeci αισθητεισ appellant" ("Nature has given five senses to living beings, sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, called αισθητεισ by the Greeks").  But there is no evidence that this [[literary topos|topos]] existed in the thinking of the Anglo-Saxons, since [[Old English]] does not possess the requisite taxonomy, and has difficulty with translations of Latin texts that do.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

The concept of there being five senses occurs in Christian sermons, devotional literature, and religious allegories of [[Middle English]], although not all authors agreed exactly which senses the five were.  [[Peter Damian]] in the 11th century correlated the five wounds that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion with the five senses, which was echoed by [[John Bromyard]] in ''Summa cantium'', although the latter only explicitly mentions hearing, touch, taste, and sight.  By the 14th century, [[Richard Rolle]] was giving the formulation of five senses that is now familiar:&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

{{quote|text=And þus were all þy five wittes occupied with peyne to bote þe trespas of our v witties.  In þy syght þou were blyndfeled, [&amp;hellip;]. In þi smellynge [&amp;hellip;].  In þy tast, [&amp;hellip;].  In hyrynge, [&amp;hellip;].  In felynge, [&amp;hellip;].|sign=[[Richard Rolle]]&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

Chaucer had the same formulation:

{{quote|text=the fyve wittes, that been sighte, herynge, smellynge, tastynge or savourynge, and feelynge|sign=[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]|source=''The Parson's Tale''&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

'''Florian Dombois''' (born 1966 in [[Berlin]]) is an artist who focuses on time, landforms, labilities, seismic and tectonic activity, as well as on their various representational and media formats.

Dombois studied [[geophysics]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Berlin]], [[Kiel]] and [[Hawaii]], and wrote his PhD in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Berlin]]. After that, he has developed a concept of "Art as Research" to challenge modernism in art and scientific modes of expression. His oeuvre includes spatial and sound installations, but also happenings and performances. 2003-2011 he was heading the [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch/y.html  Institute for Transdisciplinarity (Y)], and was president of the research council at [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch  Berne University of the Arts]. Since 2011 he is professor at [[Zurich University of the Arts]]. In 2010 he received the [[:de:Deutscher Klangkunst-Preis|German Sound Art Prize]].

Gender binary is one general type of a [[gender systems|gender system]]. Sometimes in this binary model, "sex", "gender" and "sexuality" are assumed by default to align. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a [[heterosexual]] attraction to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keating |first1=Anne |title=glbtq &gt;&gt; literature &gt;&gt; Gender |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |website=www.glbtq.com |publisher=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403155153/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''gender binary'' describes the system in which a society splits its members into one of two sets of [[gender role]]s, [[gender identity|gender identities]] and attributes based on the shape of genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64453299|title=Gendered bodies : feminist perspectives|last=Judith.|first=Lorber,|date=2007|publisher=Roxbury Pub.

Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and Catholics only allow [[cisgender]] men to serve as priests.

Worldwide, there are many individuals and even several subcultures that can be considered exceptions to the gender binary or specific [[transgender]] identities. In addition to individuals whose bodies are naturally [[intersex]], there are also specific social roles that involve aspects of both or neither of the binary genders. These include the [[Two-Spirit]]ed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] of [[India]]. In the contemporary [[Western world|West]], [[genderqueer]] people break the gender binary by refusing terms like "male" and "female". [[Transgender]] people have a unique place in relation to the gender binary. In some cases, their gender expression aligns with their sex. Attempting to conform to societal expectations for their gender, transsexual individuals may opt for surgery, hormones, or both, which can be difficult if the individual does not "pass" as [[cisgender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to Thomas Keith in ''Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture'', the longstanding cultural assumption that male–female dualities are "natural and immutable" partly explains the persistence of systems of [[patriarchy]] and [[male privilege]] in modern society.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keith |first1=Thomas |title=Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture: An Intersectional Approach to the Complexities and Challenges of Male Identity |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-31-759534-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_niDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=binary+%22patriarchy+and+male+privilege%22 |page=2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Some feminist scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. [[Judith Lorber]] explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups “even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences.”&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith. "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology." In ''The Gendered Society Reader,'' edited by Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, and Amy Kaler, 11-18. Toronto, ON: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both men and women. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without "prior assumptions about who is like whom".&lt;ref name="lorber"/&gt; By allowing for a more fluid approach to gender, people will be able to better identify themselves however they choose and scholarly research will find different similarities and differences.{{Ambiguous|date=March 2017}}

==Rejection==
[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] suggests a classification of 23 sexes and a move away from the socially constructed gender binary classification of male and female. In her paper "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", she discusses the existence of intersex people, individuals possessing a combination of male and female sexual characteristics, who are seen as deviations from the norm and who frequently undergo coercive surgery at a very young age in order to maintain the two-gender system. The existence of these individuals challenges the standards of gender binaries and put into question society's role in constructing gender.&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book | author = Morgan Holmes | title = Intersex: A Perilous Difference

Autarky equilibrium (&lt;math&gt;A^A, A^B&lt;/math&gt;): no trade, individual production equals consumption. Trade equilibrium: both countries consume the same (&lt;math&gt;C^A = C^B&lt;/math&gt;), especially beyond their own [[Production–possibility frontier]]; production and consumption points are divergent.]]
The '''Heckscher–Ohlin model''' ('''H–O model''') is a [[general equilibrium]] mathematical model of [[international trade]], developed by [[Eli Heckscher]] and [[Bertil Ohlin]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. It builds on [[David Ricardo|David Ricardo's]] theory of [[comparative advantage]] by predicting patterns of commerce and production based on the [[Factors of production|factor]] endowments of a trading region. The model essentially says that countries export products that use their abundant and cheap factors of production, and import products that use the countries' scarce factors.&lt;ref name="blaug"&gt;{{cite book |title= The methodology of economics, or, How economists explain |last= Blaug |first= Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1992 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 0-521-43678-8 |page= 190|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T4y7HyduGnIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA190,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the model==
Relative endowments of the [[factors of production]] ([[Land (economics)|land]], [[Labor (economics)|labor]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) determine a country's comparative advantage. Countries have comparative advantages in those [[Good (economics)|goods]] for which the required factors of production are relatively abundant locally. This is because the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of goods is determined by input costs. Goods that require inputs that are locally abundant are cheaper to produce than those goods that require inputs that are locally scarce.

For example, a country where capital and land are abundant but labor is scarce has a comparative advantage in goods that require lots of capital and land, but little labor—grains. If capital and land are abundant, their prices are low. As they are the main factors in the production of grain, the price of grain is also low—and thus attractive for both local consumption and export. [[Labor intensity|Labor-intensive]] goods on the other hand are very expensive to produce since labor is scarce and its price is high. Therefore, the country is better off importing those goods.

==Theoretical development==
The Ricardian model of [[comparative advantage]] has trade ultimately motivated by differences in labour productivity using different "technologies". Heckscher and Ohlin did not require production technology to vary between countries, so (in the interests of simplicity) the "H–O model has identical production technology everywhere". Ricardo considered a single [[factor of production]] (labour) and would not have been able to produce comparative advantage without technological differences between countries (all nations would become [[autarkic]] at various stages of growth, with no reason to trade with each other). The H–O model removed technology variations but introduced variable capital endowments, recreating [[endogenous]]ly the inter-country variation of labour productivity that Ricardo had imposed [[exogenous]]ly. With international variations in the capital endowment like [[infrastructure]] and goods requiring different factor "proportions", Ricardo's comparative advantage emerges as a profit-maximizing solution of capitalist's choices from ''within'' the model's equations. The decision that capital owners are faced with is between investments in differing production technologies; the H–O model assumes capital is privately held.

=== Original publication ===

[[Bertil Ohlin]] first explained the theory in a book published in 1933. Ohlin wrote the book alone, but he credited Heckscher as co-developer of the model because of his earlier work on the problem, and because many of the ideas in the final model came from Ohlin's doctoral thesis, supervised by Heckscher.

''Interregional and International Trade'' itself was verbose, rather than being pared down to the mathematical, and appealed because of its new insights.

=== 2×2×2 model ===

The original H–O model assumed that the only difference between countries was the relative abundances of labour and capital. The original Heckscher–Ohlin model contained two countries, and had two commodities that could be produced. Since there are two (homogeneous) factors of production this model is sometimes called the "2&amp;times;2&amp;times;2 model".

The model has "variable factor proportions" between countries—highly developed countries have a comparatively high capital-to-labor ratio compared to [[developing countries]]. This makes the developed country capital-abundant relative to the developing country, and the developing nation [[labor-abundant]] in relation to the developed country.

With this single difference, Ohlin was able to discuss the new mechanism of [[comparative advantage]], using just two goods and two technologies to produce them. One technology would be a [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]] industry, the other a labor-intensive business—see "assumptions" below.

=== Extensions ===

The model has been extended since the 1930s by many economists. These developments did not change the fundamental role of variable factor proportions in driving international trade, but added to the model various real-world considerations (such as [[tariff]]s) in the hopes of increasing the model's predictive power, or as a mathematical way of discussing [[macroeconomic]] policy options.

Notable contributions came from [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Ronald W. Jones|Ronald Jones]], and [[Jaroslav Vanek]], so that variations of the model are sometimes called the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model or the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model in the [[neo-classical economics]].

== Theoretical assumptions ==

The original, 2×2×2 model was derived with restrictive assumptions, partly for the sake of mathematical simplicity. Some of these have been relaxed for the sake of development. These assumptions and developments are listed here.

=== Both countries have identical production technology ===

This assumption means that producing the same output of either commodity ''could'' be done with the same level of capital and labour in either country. Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another way of saying this is that the per-capita [[productivity]] is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.

Countries have natural advantages in the production of various commodities in relation to one another, so this is an "unrealistic" simplification designed to highlight the effect of variable factors. This meant that the original H–O model produced an alternative explanation for free trade to Ricardo's, rather than a complementary one; in reality, both effects may occur due to differences in technology and factor abundances.

In addition to natural advantages in the production of one sort of output over another (wine vs. rice, say) the infrastructure, education, culture, and "know-how" of countries differ so dramatically that the idea of identical technologies is a theoretical notion. Ohlin said that the H–O model was a long-run model, and that the conditions of industrial production are "everywhere the same" in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/ho.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production output is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale ===
In a simple model, both countries produce two commodities. Each commodity in turn is made using two factors of production. The production of each commodity requires input from both factors of production—capital (K) and labor (L). The technologies of each commodity is assumed to exhibit constant [[returns to scale]] (CRS). CRS technologies implies that when inputs of both capital and labor is multiplied by a factor of ''k'', the output also multiplies by a factor of ''k''. For example, if both capital and labor inputs are doubled, output of the commodities is doubled. In other terms the production function of both commodities is "[[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree 1".

The assumption of constant returns to scale CRS is useful because it exhibits a diminishing returns in a factor. Under constant returns to scale, doubling both capital and labor leads to a doubling of the output. Since outputs are increasing in both factors of production, doubling capital while holding labor constant leads to less than doubling of an output. Diminishing returns to capital and diminishing returns to labor are crucial to the [[Stolper–Samuelson theorem]].

=== The technologies used to produce the two commodities differ ===

The CRS production functions must differ to make trade worthwhile in this model. For instance if the functions are [[Cobb–Douglas]] technologies the parameters applied to the inputs must vary. An example would be:

: Arable industry:  &lt;math&gt; A = {{K}^{1/3}}{{L}^{2/3}} &lt;/math&gt;
: Fishing industry:  &lt;math&gt;  F = {{K}^{1/2}} {{L}^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''A'' is the output in [[agronomy|arable]] production, ''F'' is the output in fish production, and ''K'', ''L'' are capital and labor in both cases.

In this example, the marginal return to an extra unit of capital is higher in the [[fishing industry]], assuming units of fish (''F'') and arable output (''A'') have equal value. The more capital-abundant country may gain by developing its fishing fleet at the expense of its arable farms. Conversely, the workers available in the relatively labor-abundant country can be employed relatively more efficiently in arable farming.

=== Factor mobility within countries ===
Within countries, capital and labor can be reinvested and reemployed to produce different outputs. Similar to Ricardo's [[comparative advantage]] argument, this is assumed to happen without cost. If the two production technologies are the arable industry and the fishing industry it is assumed that farmers can shift to work as fishermen with no cost and vice versa.

It is further assumed that capital can shift easily into either technology, so that the industrial mix can change without adjustment costs between the two types of production. For instance, if the two industries are farming and fishing it is assumed that farms can be sold to pay for the construction of fishing boats with no transaction costs.

The theory by Avsar has offered much criticism to this.

=== Factor immobility between countries ===

The basic Heckscher–Ohlin model depends upon the relative availability of capital and labor differing internationally, but if capital can be freely invested anywhere, [[competition]] (for investment) makes relative abundances identical throughout the world. Essentially, [[free trade]] in capital provides a single worldwide investment pool.

Differences in labour abundance would not produce a difference in ''relative'' factor abundance (in relation to mobile capital) because the labour/capital ratio would be identical everywhere. (A large country would receive twice as much investment as a small one, for instance, maximizing capitalist's [[return on investment]]).

As capital controls are reduced, the modern world has begun to look a lot less like the world modelled by Heckscher and Ohlin. It has been argued that capital mobility undermines the case for [[free trade]] itself, see: [[Free trade controversy#Capital mobility and comparative advantage|Capital mobility and comparative advantage Free trade critique]].

Capital is mobile when:
* There are limited [[exchange control]]s
* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) is permitted between countries, or foreigners are permitted to invest in the commercial operations of a country through a [[stock]] or [[corporate bond]] market

Like capital, labor movements are not permitted in the Heckscher–Ohlin world, since this would drive an equalization of relative abundances of the two production factors, just as in the case of capital immobility. This condition is more defensible as a description of the modern world than the assumption that capital is confined to a single country.

=== Commodity prices are the same everywhere ===

The 2x2x2 model originally placed no barriers to trade, had no [[tariff]]s, and no [[exchange control]]s (capital was immobile, but repatriation of foreign sales was costless). It was also free of transportation costs between the countries, or any other savings that would favor procuring a local supply.

If the two countries have separate [[currency|currencies]], this does not affect the model in any way—[[purchasing power parity]] applies. Since there are no transaction costs or currency issues the [[law of one price]] applies to both commodities, and consumers in either country pay exactly the same price for either good.

In Ohlin's day this assumption was a fairly neutral simplification, but economic changes and [[econometric]] research since the 1950s have shown that the local prices of goods tend to correlate with incomes when both are converted at money prices (though this is less true with traded commodities). See: [[Penn effect]].

=== Perfect internal competition ===

Neither labor nor capital has the power to affect prices or factor rates by constraining supply; a state of [[perfect competition]] exists.

== Conclusions ==
The results of this work has been the formulation of certain named conclusions arising from the assumptions inherent in the model.

===Heckscher&amp;ndash;Ohlin theorem===
{{main|Heckscher&amp;ndash;Ohlin theorem}}
Exports of a capital-abundant country come from capital-intensive industries, and labour-abundant countries import such goods, exporting labour-intensive goods in return. Competitive pressures within the H–O model produce this prediction fairly straightforwardly. Conveniently, this is an easily testable hypothesis.

===Rybczynski theorem===
{{main|Rybczynski theorem}}
When the amount of one factor of production increases, the production of the good that uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative to the increase in the factor of production, as the H–O model assumes [[perfect competition]] where price is equal to the costs of factors of production. This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two factors of production are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.

===Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem===
{{main|Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem}}
Relative changes in output goods prices drive the relative prices of the factors used to produce them. If the world price of capital-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative [[renting|rental]] rate and decreases the relative [[wage]] rate (the return on capital as against the return to labor). Also, if the price of labor-intensive goods increases, it increases the relative [[wage]] rate and decreases the relative [[renting|rental]] rate.

===Factor&amp;ndash;price equalization theorem===
{{main|Factor price equalization}}
Free and [[competitive]] trade makes factor prices converge along with traded goods prices. The FPE theorem is the most significant conclusion of the H–O model, but also has found the least agreement with the economic evidence. Neither the [[renting|rent]]al return to capital, nor the [[wage]] rates seem to consistently converge between trading partners at different levels of development.

===Implications of factor-proportion changes ===

The ''Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem'' concerns [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] rents and wages. The Magnification effect on prices considers the effect of output-goods price-changes on the real return to capital and labor. This is done by dividing the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] rates with a [[price index]], but took thirty years to develop completely because of the theoretical complexity involved. 
*The Magnification effect shows that [[trade liberalization]] actually makes the locally-scarce factor of production ''worse off'' (because increased trade makes the price index fall by less than the drop in returns to the scarce-factor induced by the ''Stolper&amp;ndash;Samuelson theorem'').
*The Magnification effect on production quantity-shifts induced by endowment changes (via the [[Rybczynski theorem]]) predicts a larger proportionate shift in output-quantity than in the corresponding endowment factor shift that induced it. This has implications to both labor and capital:
**Assuming fixed capital, population growth dilutes the scarcity of labor in relation to capital. If the population growth outpaces the growth in capital by 10% this may translate into a 20% shift in the balance of employment to the labor-intensive industries.
**In the modern world, [[money]] is much more mobile than labor, so import of capital to a country almost certainly shifts the relative factor-abundances in favor of capital. The magnification effect says that a 10% increase in national capital may lead to a redistribution of labor amounting to a fifth of the entire economy (towards capital-intensive, high-tech production). Notably, employment patterns in very poor countries can be dramatically affected by a small amount of [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], in this model. (See also: [[Dutch disease]].)

==Econometric testing of H&amp;ndash;O model theorems==
Heckscher and Ohlin considered the Factor-Price Equalization theorem an econometric success because the large volume of international trade in the late 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with the convergence of commodity ''and'' factor prices worldwide.

Modern [[econometric]] estimates have shown the model to perform poorly, however, and adjustments have been suggested, most importantly the assumption that technology is not the same everywhere. This change would mean abandoning the pure H&amp;ndash;O model.

===Leontief paradox===
{{main|Leontief paradox}}
In 1954 an econometric test by [[Wassily W. Leontief]] of the H–O model found that the United States, despite having a relative abundance of capital, tended to export labor-intensive goods and import capital-intensive goods. This problem became known as the [[Leontief paradox]]. Alternative trade models and various explanations for the paradox have emerged as a result of the paradox. One such trade model, the [[Linder hypothesis]], suggests that goods are traded based on similar demand rather than differences in supply side factors (i.e., H–O's factor endowments).

===The Vanek formula===
Various attempts in the 1960s and 1970s have been made to "solve" the Leontief paradox and save the Heckscher–Ohlin Theory from failing. From the 1980s a new series of statistical tests had been tried. The new tests depended on Vanek's formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vanek |first=J. |year=1968 |title=The Factor Proportions Theory: the ''N''-Factor Case |journal=Kyklos |volume=21 |issue= 4|pages=749–756 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-6435.1968.tb00141.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a simple form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_C} = \mathbf{V_C} - s_C\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_C}&lt;/math&gt; is the net trade of factor service vector for country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V_C}&lt;/math&gt; the factor endowment vector for country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_C&lt;/math&gt; the country &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'s share of the world consumption and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; the world total endowment vector of factors. For many countries and many factors, it is possible to estimate the left hand sides and right hand sides independently. To put it another way, the left hand side tells the direction of factor service trade. Thus it is possible to ask how this system of equations holds. The results obtained by Bowen, Leamer and Sveiskaus (1987) was disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bowen |first=Harry P. |last2=Leamer |first2=Edward E. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Sveiskaus |first3=Leo |year=1987 |title=Multicountry, Multifactor Tests of the Factor Abundance Theory |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=791–809 |doi= |jstor=1810209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined the cases of 12 factors and 27 countries for the year 1967. They found that the both sides of the equations had the same sign only for 61% of 324 cases. For the year 1983, the result was more disastrous. Both sides had the same sign only for 148 cases out of 297 cases (or the rate of correct predictions was 49.8%). The results of Bowen, Leamer, and Sveiskaus (1987) mean that the Hecksher–Ohlin–Vanek (HOV) theory has no predictive power concerning the direction of trade.

==Criticism ==

The critical assumption of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is that the two countries are identical, except for the difference in resource endowments. This also implies that the aggregate preferences are the same. The relative abundance in capital leads the capital-abundant country to produce the capital-intensive good cheaper than the labor-abundant country, and vice versa.

Initially, when the countries are not trading:

The price of the capital-intensive good in the capital-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country,
the price of the labor-intensive good in the labor-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country.
Once trade is allowed, profit-seeking firms move their products to the markets that have (temporary) higher prices. As a result:

the capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good,
the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good.
The Leontief paradox, presented by Wassily Leontief in 1951,[1] found that the U.S. (the most capital-abundant country in the world by any criterion) exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital-intensive commodities, in apparent contradiction with the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem. However, if labor is separated into two distinct factors, skilled labor and unskilled labor, the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem is more accurate. The U.S. tends to export skilled-labor-intensive goods, and tends to import unskilled-labor-intensive goods.{{Citation |first=William |last=Miberg |year=1996 |title=The rhetoric of policy relevance in international economics |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=237–259 |doi=10.1080/13501789600000017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor predictive power===
The original Heckscher–Ohlin model and extended model such as the Vanek model performs poorly, as it is shown in the section "[[Econometric]] testing of H–O model theorems". Daniel Trefler and Susan Chun Zhu summarizes their paper that "It is hard to believe that factor endowments theory [editor's note: in other words, Heckscher–Ohlin–Vanek Model] could offer an adequate explanation of international trade patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Daniel |last=Trefler |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Susan Chun |last2=Zhu |year=2000 |title=Beyond the Algebra of Explanation: HOV for the Technology Age |journal=American Economic Review |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=145–149 |doi= 10.1257/aer.90.2.145|jstor=117209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common understanding exists that in the national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the regional data of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=D. R. |first2=D. E. |last2=Weintein |first3=S. D. |last3=Bradford |first4=K. |last4=Shimpo |year=1997 |title=Using International and Japanese Regional Data to Determine When the Factor Abundance Theory of Trade Works |journal=American Economic Review |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=421–446 |doi= |jstor=2951353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the HOV formula fits well, it does not mean that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bernstein |first=J. R. |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=D. E. |last2=Weinstein |year=2002 |title=Do endowments predict the location of production?: Evidence from national and international data |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=55–76 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(01)00108-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factor equalization theorem===

The factor equalization theorem (FET) applies only to the most advanced countries. The average wage in Japan was once as big as 70 times the wage in Vietnam. These wage discrepancies are not normally in the scope of the H–O model analysis.&lt;ref name="Chris Edwards 1985 pp. 29"&gt;{{Citation |first=Chris |last=Edwards |year=1985 |title=The fragmented world: competing perspectives on trade, money, and crisis |location=London and New York |publisher=Methuen |chapter=§2.3 The Fall of The Hecksher-Ohlin Theory |pages=29–40 |isbn=0-416-73390-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckscher–Ohlin theory is badly adapted to the analyze South-North trade problems. The assumptions of H–O are unrealistic with respect to North-South trade. Income differences between North and South is the concern that third world cares most. The factor price equalization theorem has not shown a sign of realization, even for a long time lag of a half century.&lt;ref name="Stewart1989"&gt;{{Citation |first=Frances |last=Stewart |chapter=Recent Theories of International Trade: Some Implications for the South |editor-first=Henryk |editor-last=Kierzkowski |year=1989 |title=Monopolistic Competition and International Trade |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=84–108 |isbn=0-19-828726-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identical production function===

The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model assumes that the production functions are identical for all countries concerned. This means that all countries are in the same level of production and have the same technology, yet this is highly unrealistic. Technological gap between developed and developing countries is the main concern for the development of poor countries. The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model ignores all these vital factors when one wants to consider development of less developed countries in the international context.&lt;ref name="Stewart1989" /&gt; Even between developed countries, technology differs from industry to industry and firm to firm base. Indeed, this is the very basis of the competition between firms, inside the country and across the country. See the New Trade Theory in this article below.

===Capital as endowment===

In the modern production system, machines and apparatuses play an important role. What is referred to as capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.

===Homogeneous capital===

Capital goods take different forms. It may take the form of a machine-tool such as [[lathe]], the form of a transfer-machine, which you can see under the belt-conveyors. It may take the form of oil or iron core. Despite these facts, capital in the Hechscher–Ohlin model is assumed as homogeneous and transferable to any form if necessary. This assumption is not only far from the reality, but also it includes logical flaw. Capital has a measure, just like anything has weight. How can an amount of various goods be measured?&lt;ref name="Chris Edwards 1985 pp. 29"/&gt;

Usually by a system of prices. But prices depend on profit rate. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, the [[rate of profit]] is determined according to how abundant capital is. If capital is scarce, it has a high rate of profit. If it is abundant, the profit rate is low. Here is a logical circle. Before the profit rate is determined, the amount of capital is not measured. This logical difficulty was the subject of academic controversy many years ago—sometimes called the [[Cambridge capital controversy|Cambridge Capital Controversies]]. The conclusion of the controversies was that the concept of homogeneous capital was untenable. Heckscher–Ohlin theorists ignore all these stories without providing any explanation how capital is measured theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Avi J. |last=Cohen |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Geoffrey C. |last2=Harcourt |year=2003 |title=Whatever Happened to the Cambridge Capital Theory Controversies? |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=199–214 |doi=10.1257/089533003321165010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No unemployment===

Unemployment is the vital question in any trade conflict. Heckscher–Ohlin theory excludes unemployment by the very formulation of the model, in which all factors (including labour) are employed in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiozawa |first=Y. |year=2009 |title=Samuelson's Implicit Criticism against Sraffa and the Sraffians and Two Other Questions |journal=The Kyoto Economic Review |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=19–37 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ker/78/1/78_19/_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No room for firms===
Standard Heckscher–Ohlin theory assumes the same production function for all countries. This implies that all firms are identical. The theoretical consequence is that there is no room for firms in the H–O model. By contrast, the [[New Trade Theory]] emphasizes that firms are heterogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Melitz |first=M. |authorlink=Marc Melitz |year=2003 |title=The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1695–1725 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00467 |citeseerx=10.1.1.563.6294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenaway Kneller 2007"&gt;{{Citation |last=Greenaway |first=David |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Richard |last2=Kneller |year=2007 |title=Firm heterogeneity, exporting and foreign direct investment |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=117 |issue=517 |pages=F134–F161 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political background===
From the middle of the 19th century to 1930s, giant flow of immigration took place from Europe to North America. It is estimated that more than 60 million people crossed the Atlantic Ocean. Some politicians worried if these immigrants may cause various troubles (including cultural conflicts). For those politicians HO-theory provided a good reason “in support of both restrictions on labor migration and free trade in goods”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Cris |last=Edwards |year=1985 |title=The Fragmented World, Competing Perspective on Trade, Money and Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw7ICQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT28|publisher=Methuen |location=London and New York |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives theories of trade==

===New Trade Theory===

{{main|New Trade Theory}}

New Trade theorists challenge the assumption of diminishing [[returns to scale]], and some argue that using [[protectionist]] measures to build up a huge industrial base in certain industries would then allow those sectors to dominate the world market via a [[network effect]].

See also [[Intra-industry trade]].

===New Trade Theory===

New Trade Theory analyses individual enterprises and plants in an international competitive situation. The classical trade theory—i.e., the Heckscher–Ohlin model—has no enterprises in mind. The new trade theory treats enterprises in an industry as identical entities. New New Trade Theory gives focus on the diversity of enterprises. It is a fact that some enterprises engage in export and some that do not. Some enterprises invest directly in the foreign country in order to produce and sell in that country. Some other enterprises engage only in export. Why does this kind of differences occur?  New Trade Theory tries to find out the reasons of these well observed facts.&lt;ref name="Greenaway Kneller 2007" /&gt;

===Gravity model of trade===
{{main|Gravity model of trade}}

The gravity model of international trade predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes of two nations, and the distance between them.

===Ricardo–Sraffa trade theory===

''See also'': ''[[David Ricardo#The Ricardian theory of international trade|The Ricardian Theory of International Trade]]''

Ricardian theory is now extended in a general form to include not only labor, but also inputs of materials and intermediate goods. In this sense, it is much more general and plausible than the Heckscher–Ohlin model and escapes the logical problems such as capital as endowments, which is, in reality, produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiozawa |first=Y. |year=2007 |title=A New Construction of Ricardian Trade Theory—A Many-country, Many-commodity Case with Intermediate Goods and Choice of Production Techniques |journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=141–187 |doi= 10.14441/eier.3.141|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/eier/3/2/3_141/_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the theory permits different production processes to coexist in an industry of a country, the Ricardo–Sraffa theory can give a theoretical bases for the New Trade Theory.

__NOTOC__
'''Hinduism in [[Uganda]]''' arrived when the colonial [[British Empire]] brought [[Hindu]]s along with other Indian workers to its [[East Africa]]n colonies in late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Knott|title=Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ts6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874554-9|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest arrival of Hindu immigrants to Uganda, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling from the famine-prone areas of [[Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]], was to help construct the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]] connecting landlocked parts of Uganda and Kenya with the port city of [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nyep48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malory Nye|title=A Place for Our Gods: The Construction of an Edinburgh Hindu Temple Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF5cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78504-7|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest departure of Hindus from Uganda occurred when General [[Idi Amin]] expelled them and seized their properties in 1972.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nyep48"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fick199&gt;{{cite book|author=David S.

After colonialism ended, Hindus (along with Jains and Sikhs) were discriminated against in East Africa including Uganda. This was a part of the policies of various East African governments in their promotion of [[Africanization#Africanization of civil services|Africanization]] based on laws and policies under which commercial and professional sectors of the economy had to be owned by indigenous Africans.&lt;ref name="Vertovec2013p87"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovec|title=The Hindu Diaspora: Comparative Patterns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRUAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-36712-0|pages=87–89|chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Sabelo J.|author2=Ndhlovu, Finex|title=Nationalism and National Projects in Southern Africa: New Critical Reflections |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J90WAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Africa Institute of South Africa|isbn=978-0-7983-0395-8|pages=62–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindus, along with Jains, Sikhs,  Jews and other religious groups, were affected during this period of xenophobic targeting of Asians and Europeans by African leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Aminzade|title=Race, Nation, and Citizenship in Postcolonial Africa: The Case of Tanzania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQ6hAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-43605-3|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E.

When General [[Idi Amin]] came to power by overthrowing an elected government in Uganda, he adopted a policy of religious and ethnic cleansing against people of Asian religions. Himself a Muslim, he announced that he had a dream, where "Allah told him that the Asians, exploiters who did not want to integrate with the Africans, had to go".&lt;ref name="Vassanji2012p25"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.G.

According to Kim Knott, professor of Religious and Secular Studies at Lancaster University, there were 65,000 Hindus in Uganda in 1970, but all were expelled by Idi Amin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Knott|title=Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXheCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-106271-1|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expelled Hindus mass migrated to other countries during this period,&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt; particularly the [[United Kingdom]] (28,000 refugees{{refn|group=note|These numbers are total, and include non-Hindus from Asia who were expelled, such as [[Sikhism|Sikhs]].&lt;ref name=panayi43/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

==Post-Idi Amin conditions==
Twenty years after the Idi Amin expulsion, Uganda reversed its laws selectively targeting Hindus and other Indian religions.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt; This policy, offered in cooperation with the [[World Bank]], included a return of properties seized by Idi Amin's government, such as empty and unused factories, back to the families if they returned and recreated employment.&lt;ref name=fick199/&gt;

Hindus are a tiny minority in the total [[Uganda]]n population of about 27 million. The official demographics lists Christians and Muslims separately, but includes Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists and traditional African religions as others. Approximately 65% of the South Asians living in Uganda are Hindus.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">The '''Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol''' is a tool that promotes and guides more sustainable [[hydropower]] projects. It is a methodology used to measure the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics.

Hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact. This is because the construction of a [[dam]], power plant and [[reservoir]] creates certain social and physical changes in the area it effects. The protocol provides a common language to allow governments, [[civil society]], financial institutions and the hydropower sector to talk about and evaluate [[sustainability]] issues.

Assessments are based on objective evidence and the results are presented in a standardised way, to show how new projects are being developed or how existing facilities are performing.

It has been designed to work on projects and facilities anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Protocol Basics|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application  ==

=== Purpose ===

The Protocol is used by different hydropower stakeholders for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - How it can help|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/How-can-it-help-.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular uses include: 
 
* Independent review of sustainability issues
* Guiding improvement of sustainability practice
* Comparison with international best practice
* Communication with stakeholders
* Facilitating access to finance
* Preparing clients to meet bank requirements
* Reducing investment risk

=== Users ===

[[Crédit Agricole]], [[Société Générale|Societe Generale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[Citigroup|Citi]], and [[UBS]] now refer to the Protocol in their sector guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediacommun.ca-cib.com/sitegenic/medias/DOC/13870/2012-12-politique-sectorielle-rse-energie-hydroelectricite-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/Finance%20responsable/Dams%20&amp;%20Hydropower%20Sector%20Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sc.com/en/resources/global-en/pdf/sustainabilty/Dams_and_Hydropower_Position_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citigroup.com/citi/environment/data/1160840_Sector_Brief_HydroPower.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/ubs/global/about_ubs/corporate_responsibility/UBS-ESR-framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] has analysed the value of the Protocol for use by their clients, concluding that it is a useful tool for guiding the development of sustainable hydropower in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Protocol for World Bank clients|url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/06/20106007/hydropower-sustainability-assessment-protocol-use-world-bank-clients-lessons-learned-recommendations|website = documents.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] has reviewed social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects, concluding that the Protocol currently offers the best available ‘measuring stick’ for the [[World Commission on Dams]] provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A review of social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects|url = http://pubs.iied.org/17517IIED.html|website = pubs.iied.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

A Protocol assessment takes place over a one-week period at the project site and provides a rapid sustainability check.

A Protocol assessment does not replace an [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental and social impact assessment]] (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time as a mandatory regulatory requirement. A Protocol assessment will, amongst other things, check the scope and quality of the ESIA which has been done.

To ensure high quality, all commercial use of the Protocol is carried out by accredited assessors. These assessors have significant experience of the hydropower sector or relevant sustainability issues, and have passed a rigorous accreditation course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Accredited Assessors|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Accredited-Assessors.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

=== Tools ===
The Protocol can be used at any stage of hydropower development, from the early planning stages through to operation.  Each project stage is assessed using a different tool: 
* The early stage tool, a screening tool for potential hydropower projects
* The preparation tool, which covers planning and design, management plans and commitments.
* The implementation tool, used through the construction phase.
* The operation tool, used on working projects.

=== Topics ===
The Protocol covers a range of topics that need to be understood to assess the overall sustainability of a hydropower project.

The name and range of topics changes slightly at different project stages.

==== Social aspects ====

*Communications and consultation
*Project benefits
*Project affected communities and livelihoods
*Resettlement 
*[[Indigenous peoples]]
*Labour and working conditions
*Public health
*Cultural heritage

==== Environmental aspects ====

*Environmental and social assessment and management  
*[[Biodiversity]] and invasive species 
*[[Erosion]] and [[sedimentation]]  
*Water quality  
*Waste, noise and air quality  
*[[Reservoir]] planning / preparation and filling / management  
*Downstream flow regimes

==== Business aspects ====

*[[Governance]]
*[[Procurement]]
*Integrated project management 
*Financial viability
*Economic viability

==== Technical aspects ====

*Demonstrated need and strategic fit
*Siting and design
*Hydrological resource
*Asset reliability and efficiency
*Infrastructure safety

The Protocol also includes ‘cross-cutting issues’ such as [[climate change]], [[gender]], and [[human rights]], which feature in multiple topics.

=== Criteria ===
For each sustainability topic, performance is assessed against a range of criteria at two levels: basic good practice and proven best practice.

== History  ==
A multi-stakeholder forum developed the Protocol between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - History|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Protocol-development.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following key group were represented: social and environmental NGOs, governments of developed and developing countries, financial institutions, development banks, and the hydropower industry.

The forum jointly reviewed, enhanced and built consensus on what a sustainable hydropower project should look like.

Policies taken into account included the [[World Commission on Dams]]’ Criteria and Guidelines, World Bank Safeguard Policies, IFC Performance Standards, and the [[Equator Principles]].

A draft of the Protocol was released in 2009, which was trialled in 16 countries across six continents and subjected to further consultation involving 1,933 individual stakeholders from 28 countries.

The final version was produced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Download Protocol Document|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/The-Protocol-Documents.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of the forum was important to ensure that the Protocol became globally applicable and universally accepted. Diversity also ensured that the multiple perspectives and stakeholder interests surrounding a hydropower project were incorporated into the document.

== Governance  ==
The Protocol is governed by a multi-stakeholder body, the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Council (HSA Council).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Governance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council is to ensure multi-stakeholder input and confidence in the Protocol's content and application.

All individuals and organisations engaged in hydropower are welcome and encouraged to join the Council. This approach to governance ensures that all stakeholder voices are heard in the shaping of the use of the Protocol and its future development.

The Council consists of a series of Chambers, each representing a different segment of hydropower stakeholders. Each chamber elects a chair and alternate chair for a two-year term. The chamber chairs come together regularly to form the decision-making Protocol Governance Committee. The current Governance Committee (elected May 2015) is shown in the table below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24128">In mathematics, '''infinite [[composition (mathematics)|compositions]] of [[analytic function]]s (ICAF)''' offer alternative formulations of [[Generalized continued fraction|analytic continued fractions]], [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[product (mathematics)|products]] and other infinite expansions, and the theory evolving from such compositions may shed light on the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence/divergence]] of these expansions. Some functions can actually be expanded directly as infinite compositions. In addition, it is possible to use ICAF to evaluate solutions of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] equations involving infinite expansions. [[Complex dynamics]] offers another venue for [[iterated function system|iteration of systems of functions]] rather than a single function. For infinite compositions of a ''single function'' see [[Iterated function]]. For compositions of a finite number of functions, useful in [[fractal]] theory, see [[Iterated function system]]. 

Although the title of this article specifies analytic functions, there are results for more general [[Complex analysis|functions of a complex variable]] as well.


==Notation==
There are several notations describing infinite compositions, including the following:

'''Forward compositions:''' {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;k,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'').}}

'''Backward compositions:''' {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;k,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')}}

In each case convergence is interpreted as the existence of the following limits:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\to \infty} F_{1,n}(z), \qquad \lim_{n\to\infty} G_{1,n}(z).&lt;/math&gt;

For convenience, set {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}} and {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}}.

One may also write &lt;math&gt;F_n(z)=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\mathop R}}\,f_k(z)=f_1 \circ f_2\circ \cdots \circ f_n(z)&lt;/math&gt;  and
&lt;math&gt;G_n(z)=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\mathop L}}\,g_k(z)=g_n \circ g_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ g_1(z)&lt;/math&gt;

==Contraction theorem==
Many results can be considered extensions of the following result:

:'''Contraction Theorem for Analytic Functions.'''&lt;ref&gt;P. Henrici, ''Applied and Computational Complex Analysis'', Vol. 1 (Wiley, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''f'' be analytic in a simply-connected region ''S'' and continuous on the closure {{overline|''S''}} of ''S''. Suppose ''f''({{overline|''S''}}) is a bounded set contained in ''S''. Then for all ''z'' in {{overline|''S''}} there exists an [[Fixed point (mathematics)#Attractive fixed points|attractive fixed point]] α of ''f'' in ''S'' such that:
::&lt;math&gt;F_n(z)=(f\circ f\circ \cdots \circ f)(z)\to \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

==Infinite compositions of contractive functions==
Let {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a sequence of functions analytic on a simply-connected domain ''S''. Suppose there exists a compact set Ω ⊂ ''S'' such that for each ''n'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''S'') ⊂ Ω.

:'''Forward (inner or right) Compositions Theorem.''' {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges uniformly on compact subsets of ''S'' to a constant function ''F''(''z'') = λ.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lorentzen, Compositions of contractions, J. Comp &amp; Appl Math. 32 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Backward (outer or left) Compositions Theorem.''' {''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges uniformly on compact subsets of ''S'' to γ ∈ Ω if and only if the sequence of fixed points {''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} of the {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges to ''γ''.&lt;ref name = Gilla&gt;J. Gill, The use of the sequence {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}} in computing the fixed points of continued fractions, products, and series, Appl. Numer. Math. 8 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional theory resulting from investigations based on these two theorems, particularly Forward Compositions Theorem, include location analysis for the limits obtained here [http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/keenl/blochconstantsfinalversion.pdf]. For a different approach to Backward Compositions Theorem, see [http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/keenl/forwarditer.pdf].

Regarding Backward Compositions Theorem, the example ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = 1/2 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = −1/2 for ''S'' = {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; 1} demonstrates the inadequacy of simply requiring contraction into a compact subset, like Forward Compositions Theorem.

For functions not necessarily analytic the [[Contraction mapping|Lipschitz]] condition suffices:

:'''Theorem.'''&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;J. Gill, A Primer on the Elementary Theory of Infinite Compositions of Complex Functions, Comm. Anal. Th. Cont. Frac., Vol XXIII (2017) and researchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a simply connected compact subset of &lt;math&gt;\C&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;t_n : S \to S&lt;/math&gt; be a family of functions that satisfies 
::&lt;math&gt; \forall n, \forall z_1, z_2 \in S, \exists \rho: \quad \left|t_n(z_1)-t_n(z_2) \right|\le \rho |z_1-z_2|, \quad \rho &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:Define:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_n(z) &amp;= \left (t_n\circ t_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ t_1 \right ) (z) \\
 F_n(z) &amp;= \left (t_1 \circ t_2\circ \cdots \circ t_n \right ) (z)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Then  &lt;math&gt;F_n(z)\to \beta \in S&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;S.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; is the unique fixed point of &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;G_n(z)\to \alpha &lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|\alpha_n -\alpha|=\varepsilon_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Infinite compositions of other functions==

=== Non-contractive complex functions ===
Results&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; involving '''[[entire function]]s''' include the following, as examples. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_n(z)&amp;=a_n z + c_{n,2}z^2+c_{n,3} z^3+\cdots \\
\rho_n &amp;= \sup_r \left\{ \left| c_{n,r} \right|^{\frac{1}{r-1}} \right\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the following results hold:

:'''Theorem E1.'''&lt;ref name=Kojima&gt;S.Kojima, Convergence of infinite compositions of entire functions, arXiv:1009.2833v1&lt;/ref&gt; If ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1,
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \rho_n &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
:then ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''F'', entire.

:'''Theorem E2.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb&gt;J. Gill, John Gill Mathematics Notes, researchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt;  Set ε&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = |''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''−1| suppose there exists non-negative δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R'' such that the following holds:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n &amp;&lt; \infty, \\
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \delta_n &amp;&lt; \infty, \\
\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1+\delta_n) &amp;&lt; M_1, \\
\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1+\varepsilon_n) &amp;&lt; M_2, \\
\rho_n &amp;&lt; \frac{\delta_n}{R M_1 M_2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z''), analytic for |''z''| &lt; ''R''. Convergence is uniform on compact subsets of {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; ''R''}.

'''Additional elementary results include:'''

:'''Theorem GF3.'''&lt;ref name=Gill /&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\rho_n \varphi (z)&lt;/math&gt; where there exist &lt;math&gt;R, M&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;| \varphi(z)|&lt;M.&lt;/math&gt; Furthermore, suppose &lt;math&gt;\rho_k\ge 0, \sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho_k&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;R&gt;M\sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho_k.&lt;/math&gt; Then for &lt;math&gt;R*&lt;R-M\sum_{k=1}^n \rho_k&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;G_n(z)\equiv \left (f_n\circ f_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ f_1 \right ) (z) \to G(z) \qquad  \text{ for } \{z:|z|&lt;R*\}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;F_n(z)\equiv \left (f_1\circ f_2\circ \cdots \circ f_n \right) (z) \to F(z) \qquad \text{ for } \{z:|z|&lt;R*\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear fractional transformations ===
Results&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; for compositions of '''[[möbius transformation|linear fractional (Möbius) transformations]]''' include the following, as examples:

:'''Theorem LFT1.'''  On the set of convergence of a sequence {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} of non-singular LFTs, the limit function is either:
:*(a) a non-singular LFT,
:*(b) a function taking on two distinct values, or
:*(c) a constant.
In (a), the sequence converges everywhere in the extended plane. In (b), the sequence converges either everywhere, and to the same value everywhere except at one point, or it converges at only two points. Case (c) can occur with every possible set of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piranian &amp; W. Thron,Convergence properties of sequences of Linear fractional transformations, Mich. Math. J.,Vol. 4 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Theorem LFT2.'''&lt;ref&gt;J. DePree &amp; W. Thron,On sequences of Mobius transformations, Math. Z., Vol. 80 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; If {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges to an LFT, then ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converge to the identity function ''f''(''z'') = ''z''.

:'''Theorem LFT3.'''&lt;ref&gt;A. Magnus &amp; M. Mandell, On convergence of sequences of linear fractional transformations,Math. Z. 115 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; If ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''f'' and all functions are ''hyperbolic'' or ''loxodromic'' Möbius transformations, then ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''λ'', a constant, for all &lt;math&gt;z \ne \beta = \lim_{n\to \infty} \beta_n&lt;/math&gt;, where {''β&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} are the repulsive fixed points of the {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

:then ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''λ'', a constant in the extended complex plane, for all ''z''.

==Examples and applications==

=== Continued fractions ===
The value of the infinite continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{a_1}{b_1+\cfrac{a_2}{b_2+\cdots}}&lt;/math&gt;

may be expressed as the limit of the sequence {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)} where

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=\frac{a_n}{b_n+z}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a simple example, a well-known result (Worpitsky Circle*&lt;ref&gt;L. Lorentzen, H. Waadeland, ''Continued Fractions with Applications'', North Holland (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;) follows from an application of Theorem (A):

Consider the continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{a_1\zeta }{1+\cfrac{a_2\zeta }{1+\cdots}} &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=\frac{a_n \zeta }{1+z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Stipulate that |ζ| &lt; 1 and |''z''| &lt; ''R'' &lt; 1.  Then for 0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1,

: &lt;math&gt;|a_n|&lt;rR(1-R)\Rightarrow \left|f_n(z) \right|&lt;rR&lt;R\Rightarrow \frac{a_1\zeta }{1+\frac{a_2\zeta }{1+\cdots}} = F(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt;, analytic for |''z''| &lt; 1. Set ''R'' = 1/2.

'''Example.''' &lt;math&gt;F(z)=\frac{(i-1)z}{1+i+z\text{   }+}\text{  }\frac{(2-i)z}{1+2i+z\text{   }+}\text{  }\frac{(3-i)z}{1+3i+z\text{   }+} \cdots, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[-15,15]&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Continued fraction1.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Example: Continued fraction1 – Topographical (moduli) image of a continued fraction (one for each point) in the complex plane. [−15,15]]]

'''Example.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; A ''fixed-point continued fraction form'' (a single variable).
:&lt;math&gt;f_{k,n}(z)=\frac{\alpha_{k,n} \beta_{k,n} }{\alpha_{k,n}+\beta_{k,n}-z}, \alpha_{k,n}=\alpha_{k,n}(z), \beta_{k,n}=\beta_{k,n}(z), F_n(z)= \left (f_{1,n} \circ\cdots \circ f_{n,n} \right ) (z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{k,n}=xcos(ty)+iysin(tx), \beta_{k,n}=cos(ty)+isin(tx), t=k/n&lt;/math&gt;

=== Direct functional expansion ===
Examples illustrating the conversion of a function directly into a composition follow:

'''Example 1.'''&lt;ref name=Kojima /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Steinmetz, ''Rational Iteration'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an entire function satisfying the following conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \phi (tz)=t\left( \phi (z)+\phi (z)^2 \right) &amp; |t|&gt; 1 \\ \phi(0) = 0 \\ \phi'(0) =1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{z^2}{t^n}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \phi (z)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 2.'''&lt;ref name=Kojima /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{z^2}{2^n}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \frac{1}{2}\left( e^{2z}-1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 3.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)= \frac{z}{1-\tfrac{z^2}{4^n}}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \tan (z)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=\frac{2 \cdot 4^{n}}{z} \left ( \sqrt{1+\frac{z^2}{4^{n}}}-1 \right )\Longrightarrow G_n(z) \to \arctan (z)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Calculation of fixed-points ===
Theorem (B) can be applied to determine the fixed-points of functions defined by infinite expansions or certain integrals. The following examples illustrate the process:

'''Example FP1.'''&lt;ref name=Gilla /&gt; For |ζ| ≤ 1 let

:&lt;math&gt;G(\zeta )=\frac{ \tfrac{e^\zeta}{4}}{3+\zeta +\cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta} 8 }{3+\zeta + \cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta}{12}}{3+\zeta +\cdots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

To find α = ''G''(α), first we define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t_n(z)&amp;=\cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta}{4n}}{3+\zeta +z} \\
f_n(\zeta )&amp;= t_1\circ t_2\circ \cdots \circ t_n(0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then calculate &lt;math&gt;G_n(\zeta )=f_n\circ \cdots \circ f_1(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt; with ζ = 1, which gives: α = 0.087118118... to ten decimal places after ten iterations.

:'''Theorem FP2.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; Let φ(ζ, ''t'') be analytic in ''S'' = {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; ''R''} for all ''t'' in [0, 1] and continuous in ''t''. Set
::&lt;math&gt;f_n (\zeta)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \varphi \left( \zeta ,\tfrac{k}{n} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
:If |φ(ζ, ''t'')| ≤ ''r'' &lt; ''R'' for ζ ∈ ''S'' and ''t'' ∈ [0, 1], then
::&lt;math&gt;\zeta =\int_0^1 \varphi (\zeta ,t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:has a unique solution, α in ''S'', with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty} G_n(\zeta ) = \alpha. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Evolution functions ===
Consider a time interval, normalized to ''I'' = [0, 1]. ICAFs can be constructed to describe continuous motion of a point, ''z'', over the interval, but in such a way that at each "instant" the motion is virtually zero (see [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's Arrow]]): For the interval divided into n equal subintervals, 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'' set &lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)=z+\varphi_{k,n}(z)&lt;/math&gt; analytic or simply continuous – in a domain ''S'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi_{k,n}(z)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k'' and all ''z'' in ''S'', 
and &lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Principal example&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; ====

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g_{k,n}(z) &amp;=z+\frac{1}{n}\phi  \left (z,\tfrac{k}{n} \right ) \\
G_{k,n}(z) &amp;= \left (g_{k,n}\circ g_{k-1,n} \circ \cdots \circ g_{1,n} \right ) (z) \\ 
G_n(z) &amp;=G_{n,n}(z)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

implies

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n(z)\doteq G_n(z)-z=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \phi  \left( G_{k-1,n}(z)\tfrac k n \right)\doteq \frac 1 n \sum_{k=1}^n \psi \left (z,\tfrac{k}{n} \right) \sim \int_0^1 \psi (z,t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is well-defined if &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dz}{dt}=\phi  (z,t)&lt;/math&gt; has a closed-form solution ''z''(''t'').  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n(z_0)\approx \int_0^1 \phi ( z(t),t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise, the integrand is poorly defined although the value of the integral is easily computed. In this case one might call the integral a "virtual" integral.

'''Example.''' &lt;math&gt;\phi  (z,t)=\frac{2t-\cos y}{1-\sin x\cos y}+i\frac{1-2t\sin x}{1-\sin x\cos y}, \int_0^1 \psi (z,t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Contours in the vector field f(z) = -Cos(z).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Two contours flowing towards an attractive fixed point (red on the left). The white contour (''c'' = 2) terminates before reaching the fixed point. The second contour (''c''(''n'') = square root of ''n'') terminates at the fixed point. For both contours, ''n'' = 10,000]]

'''Example.'''&lt;ref&gt;J. Gill, Informal Notes: Zeno contours, parametric forms, &amp; integrals, Comm. Anal. Th. Cont. Frac., Vol XX (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Let:

:&lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=z+\frac{c_n}{n}\phi  (z), \quad \text{with} \quad f(z) = z + \phi(z).&lt;/math&gt;

Next, set &lt;math&gt;T_{1,n}(z)=g_n(z), T_{k,n}(z)= g_n(T_{k-1,n}(z)),&lt;/math&gt; and ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') = ''T&lt;sub&gt;n,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z''). Let

:&lt;math&gt;T(z)=\lim_{n\to \infty} T_n(z)&lt;/math&gt;

when that limit exists. The sequence {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')} defines contours γ = γ(''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z'') that follow the flow of the vector field ''f''(''z''). If there exists an attractive fixed point α, meaning |''f''(''z'') − α| ≤ ρ|''z'' − α| for 0 ≤ ρ &lt; 1, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''T''(''z'') ≡ α along γ = γ(''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z''), provided (for example) &lt;math&gt;c_n = \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''c'' &gt; 0, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''T''(''z''), a point on the contour γ = γ(''c'', ''z''). It is easily seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\gamma \phi  (\zeta ) \, d\zeta =\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac c n \sum_{k=1}^n \phi ^2 \left (T_{k-1,n}(z) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;L(\gamma (z))=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{c}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \left| \phi  \left (T_{k-1,n}(z) \right ) \right|, &lt;/math&gt;

when these limits exist.

These concepts are marginally related to ''[[Active contour model|active contour theory]]'' in image processing, and are simple generalizations of the [[Euler method]]

=== Self-replicating expansions ===

====Series====
The series defined recursively by ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') = ''z'' + ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') have the property that the nth term is predicated on the sum of the first ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 terms. In order to employ theorem (GF3) it is necessary to show boundedness in the following sense: If each ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined for |''z''| &lt; ''M'' then |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; ''M'' must follow before |''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z''| =&amp;nbsp;|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| ≤&amp;nbsp;''Cβ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined for iterative purposes. This is because &lt;math&gt;g_n(G_{n-1}(z))&lt;/math&gt; occurs throughout the expansion. The restriction

:&lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;R=M-C\sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

serves this purpose. Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z'') uniformly on the restricted domain.

'''Example (S1).'''   Set 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{1}{\rho n^2}\sqrt{z}, \qquad \rho &gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{6}}&lt;/math&gt; 
and ''M'' = ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''R'' = ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (π/6) &gt; 0. Then, if &lt;math&gt;S=\left\{ z: |z|&lt;R,\operatorname{Re}(z)&gt;0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, ''z'' in ''S'' implies |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; ''M'' and theorem (GF3) applies, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_n(z) &amp;=z+g_1(z)+g_2(G_1(z))+g_3(G_2(z))+\cdots + g_n(G_{n-1}(z)) \\ 
&amp;= z+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 1^2}\sqrt{z}+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 2^2}\sqrt{G_1(z)}+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 3^2}\sqrt{G_2(z)}+\cdots +\frac{1}{\rho \cdot n^2} \sqrt{G_{n-1}(z)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

converges absolutely, hence is convergent.

'''Example (S2)''':   &lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac 1 {n^2}\cdot \varphi (z), \varphi (z)=2\cos(x/y)+i2\sin (x/y), &gt;G_n(z)=f_n \circ f_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ f_1(z), \qquad [-10,10], n=50 &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Self-generating series3.jpg|thumb|center|325px|Example (S2)- A topographical (moduli) image of a self generating series.]]

====Products====
The product defined recursively by

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z( 1+g_n(z)), \qquad |z| \leqslant M,&lt;/math&gt;

has the appearance

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(z) = z \prod _{k=1}^n \left( 1+g_k \left( G_{k-1}(z) \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

In order to apply Theorem GF3 it is required that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left| zg_n(z) \right|\le C\beta_n, \qquad \sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, a boundedness condition must support

:&lt;math&gt;\left|G_{n-1}(z) g_n(G_{n-1}(z))\right|\le C \beta_n.&lt;/math&gt;

If one knows ''Cβ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in advance, the following will suffice:

:&lt;math&gt;|z| \leqslant R = \frac{M}{P} \qquad \text{where} \quad P = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( 1+C\beta_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z'') uniformly on the restricted domain.

'''Example (P1).'''  Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z(1+g_n(z))&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=\tfrac{z^2}{n^3},&lt;/math&gt; observing after a few preliminary computations, that |''z''| ≤ 1/4 implies |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; 0.27. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|G_n(z)  \frac{G_n(z)^2}{n^3} \right|&lt;(0.02)\frac{1}{n^3}=C\beta_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(z)=z \prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( 1+\frac{G_k(z)^2}{n^3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

converges uniformly.

'''Example (P2).'''

:&lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)=z\left( 1+\frac 1 n \varphi \left (z,\tfrac k n \right ) \right),&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{n,n}(z)= \left ( g_{n,n}\circ g_{n-1,n}\circ \cdots \circ g_{1,n} \right ) (z) = z\prod_{k=1}^n ( 1+P_{k,n}(z)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{k,n}(z)=\frac 1 n \varphi \left (G_{k-1,n}(z),\tfrac{k}{n} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left( 1+P_{k,n}(z) \right) = 1+P_{1,n}(z)+{{P}_{2,n}}(z)+\cdots +{{P}_{k-1,n}}(z) + R_n(z) \sim \int_0^1 \pi (z,t) \, dt + 1+R_n(z),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (z)=x\cos(y)+i\cdot y\sin(x), \int_0^1 (z\pi (z,t)-1) \,dt, \qquad [-15,15]: &lt;/math&gt;

The return paths can be two-way or bi-directional: information can flow back and forth.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;

An IFD can be used to model the information flow throughout an organisation. An IFD shows the relationship between internal information flows within an organisation and external information flows between organisations. It also shows the relationship between the internal departments and sub-systems.

An IFD usually uses "blobs" to decompose the system and sub-systems into elemental parts.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt; Lines then indicate how the information travels from one system to another. IFDs are used in businesses, government agencies, television and cinematic processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

IFDs are often confused with [[data flow diagram]]s (DFDs). IFDs show information as sources, destination and flows. DFDs  show processes where inputs are transformed into outputs. Databases are also present in DFDs to show where data is held within the systems. In DFDs information destinations are called "sinks".&lt;ref name="Bocij"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bocij |first1=Paul |last2=Chaffey |first2=Dave |date=2003 |chapter=Systems analysis |title=Business information systems: technology, development, and management for the e-business |edition=2nd |location=Harlow, UK; New York |publisher=FT/Prentice Hall |pages=171–189 |isbn=027365540X |oclc=49383949 |chapterurl=http://www.stephenson.ac.uk/computing/it_hn03/16_information_systems/resources/im/ch10.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180}}

==Purpose==
[[Peter Checkland]], a British management scientist, described information flows between the different elements that compose various systems. He also defined a system as a "community situated within an environment".&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;

The main purpose of an information flow diagram is so that sources that send and receive information can be displayed neatly and analysed. This allows viewers to see the forwarding of information and the analysis of different situations.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt; The creation of an IFD is, in most cases, the first step in information analysis.&lt;ref name="Wintraecken" /&gt;{{rp|37}}

IFDs are behaviour diagrams that show the exchange of data between systems. They are also used to describe the circulation of information within systems.&lt;ref name="uml"&gt;{{cite web |title=UML information flow diagrams |url=http://www.uml-diagrams.org/information-flow-diagrams.html |website=uml-diagrams.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118061853/http://www.uml-diagrams.org/information-flow-diagrams.html |archivedate=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information that moves along the diagram is represented as either information items or by concrete classifiers. IFDs are used to:&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;
* Develop a high level overview of the flow of information in an organisation.
* Highlight detailed flows in an individual task.
* Describe the flow of information inside and around organisations and between departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yull |first1=Sharon |last2=Jarvis |first2=Alan |last3=Lawson |first3=Jenny |date=2005 |chapter=Information and its use |title=AS level GCE applied ICT |location=Oxford |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=9780435449957 |oclc=58054511 |pages=40–48 |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MDx5LMbkqCsC&amp;pg=PT53 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Understand business process bottlenecks in sequential, deferred, real-time, parallel, wheel, one-to-many, many-to-many and many-to-one-to-many information flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durugbo |first1=Christopher |last2=Tiwari |first2=Ashutosh |last3=Alcock |first3=Jeffrey R. |date=June 2013 |title=Modelling information flow for organisations: a review of approaches and future challenges |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=597–610 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2013.01.009 |url=http://foresight.ifmo.ru/ict/shared/files/201312/1_191.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and construction of IFD==
Construction of an information flow diagram requires the knowledge of different information sources and the connections between them. The sources and targets of information flow are one of the following: actor, use case, node, artefact, class, component, port, property, interface, package, activity node, activity partition, or instance specification.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A dashed line with an open arrow pointing away from the source to the target is used to represent information flow. The keyword "flow" may be written above or below the dashed line. Information items represent the abstraction of data and act as information flow connectors, representing the flow of transfer of information from source to target. Information items do not provide any detail of the information they transfer as they are featureless.&lt;ref name="uml" /&gt;

Diagramming software can be used to create IFDs. Examples of diagramming software include [[Microsoft Visio]] for [[Windows]] or [[OmniGraffle]] for [[OS X]].

Successful IFDs should highlight gaps that need improvement, display inefficiencies in information, uncover and highlight risks to information such as data confidentiality and Insecure systems, display unsuitable mediums which are being used, and they should also provide clarity about who should receive which information when, where and how.

===Example situation===
[[File:Infodiagram2.jpg|thumb|Example: Customer posts an order.]]
A customer needs to make an order. Customer first posts the order to the sales department. Customer's order details are then entered into a centralised database which can only be accessed by the warehouse (to make up the order). The goods are handed to the dispatch department with a delivery note attached to them for delivery. On delivery, the customer receives the goods and the delivery note (which are handled by a member of the dispatch department). Sales department creates an invoice which is posted to the customer. The accounts department then assesses a copy of the invoice from the centralised database. Customer is then required to post the payment to the accounts department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Vincent |title=Information flow: an information flow diagram is a useful way of showing how information moves into and out of an organisation and between individuals |url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/6422409/ |website=slideplayer.com |accessdate=2016-03-20 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Limitations of information flow diagrams may include:
* The nature of information that is used in the IFD and the mechanisms by which it is conveyed, exchanged and the control conditions are not specified.&lt;ref name="uml" /&gt;
* The signal given out and the signal received are in many cases different. This also applies to feedback messages, due to distortions.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;
* The intentions of messages sometimes not understood when receiving a signal and message.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;
* Information items do not provide details about the information they transfer as they don't have features, generalisations or associations.&lt;ref name="Schade" /&gt;
* Detail about timing (what happens when) is not given.&lt;ref name="Bocij" /&gt;

'''Leonel Moura''' (born December 26, 1948 in Lisbon, Portugal) is a conceptual artist whose work shifted in the late 1990s from photo based work to [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Robotic art]]. Since then he has produced several Painting Robots and the Robotarium, a zoo for robots. RAP (Robotic Action Painter) (2006) is a robot that makes drawings based on [[emergence]] and [[stigmergy]], decides when the work is ready, and signs it, is displayed as a permanent installation at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Leonel Moura and Henrique Garica Pereira, "Man and Robots: Symbiotic Art".

==Robots==

'''ArtSbot''' (Art [[Swarm]] Robots), 2003, comprise several small autonomous robots, called Mbots, each equipped with color detection sensors, obstacle avoidance sensors, a microcontroller and actuators, for locomotion and pen manipulation. Mbots have two distinct behaviors: the random behavior that initializes the process by activating a pen, based on a small probability (usually 2/256), whenever the color sensors read white; and the positive feed-back behavior that reinforces the color detected by the sensors, activating the corresponding pen (since there are two pens, the color circle is split into two ranges - 'warm' and 'cold'). With this process the collective set of robots generate compositions where from a random background some color clusters emerge.

'''RAP''' (Robotic Action Painter), 2006, work alone but based on the same principles of emergence and stigmergy. Some improvements however produce rather distinct compositions from those of the ArtSbot swarm. Some of the new skills are: to determine the length and shape of each trace, the capacity to decide, in a non-linear mode, the moment to stop and the ability to sign. Additionally RAP works with six color pens and the RGB sensors are disposed in a grid of 3x3 which permits to detect local patterns and not only colors.

'''ISU''', 2006, is very similar to RAP but is able to write letters and build words. In this fashion it makes compositions that resemble some of the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] works from the 1950s and automatism.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Robotarium X''' is a large-scale steel glass construction lodging forty-five different robots, most powered by photovoltaic energy and fully autonomous.

'''RUR, the birth of the robot'''

In 2010 Leonel Moura creates a new version of the theatre play RUR with robots.&lt;br&gt;
R.U.R., Rossum’s Universal Robots is a classic playwright written by Karel Capek in the 1920s in which the word ROBOT was coined. Men and robots clash resulting in the extermination of mankind and the emergence of robots as a new dominant species. The play was always staged with human actor’s transvestite as robots. Moura’s new version displays, for the first time, real robots interacting on stage with human actors.&lt;br&gt;
RUR, the birth of the robot, debuted in August 2010 at the Itáu Cultural, São Paulo, Brazil.

'''Mindstream''' (''citta-santāna'') in [[Buddhist philosophy]] is the moment-to-moment continuum (Sanskrit: ''saṃtāna'') of sense impressions and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also described as continuing from one life to another.&lt;ref&gt;The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering by Bhikkhu Bodhi
 http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/noble8path6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''{{IAST|Citta-saṃtāna}}'' (Sanskrit), literally "the stream of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.62.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the stream of succeeding moments of mind or awareness. It provides a continuity of the personality in the absence of a permanently abiding "self" ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]), which Buddhism denies. The mindstream provides a continuity from one life to another, akin to the flame of a candle which may be passed from one candle to another:{{sfn|Kyimo|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Panjvani|2013|p=181}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the analogies in the [[Milinda Panha]]}} 
{{quote|Indian Buddhists see the 'evolution' of mind i[n] terms of the continuity of individual mind-streams from one lifetime to the next, with [[karma]] as the basic causal mechanism whereby transformations are transmitted from one life to the next.&lt;ref name="Waldron, William S. 2007"&gt;Waldron, William S. (undated). ''Buddhist Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Thinking about &lt;nowiki&gt;'Thoughts without a Thinker'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.

According to Waldron, 
{{quote|[T]he mind stream (''santāna'') increases gradually by the mental afflictions (''kleśa'') and by actions (''karma''), and goes again to the next world. In this way the circle of existence is without beginning."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. (2003). "Common Ground, Common Cause: Buddhism and Science on the Afflictions of Identity" in Wallace, B.

==Etymology==

===Sanskrit===
''Citta'' holds the [[semantic field]] of "that which is conscious", "the act of mental apprehension known as ordinary consciousness", "the conventional and relative mind/heart".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"&gt;Source: [http://www.dharmafellowship.org/library/essays/buddhist-glossary.htm#santana] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Citta'' has two aspects: "...Its two aspects are attending to and collecting of impressions or traces (Sanskrit: ''[[Vasanas|vāsanā]]'') cf. ''[[vijñāna]]''."&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt; ''{{IAST|Saṃtāna}}'' or ''santāna'' (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field of "eternal", "continuum", "a series of momentary events" or "life-stream".&lt;ref name="dharmafellowship.org"/&gt;

===Tibetan===
''Citta'' is often rendered as ''sems'' in Tibetan and saṃtāna corresponds to ''rgyud'', which holds the [[semantic field]] of "continuum", "stream", and "thread"--{{IAST|Citta-saṃtāna}} is therefore rendered ''sems rgyud.'' ''Rgyud'' is the term that Tibetan translators (Tibetan: ''lotsawa'') employed to render the Sanskrit term "''[[tantra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2002; 2007). ''Making Sense of Tantra''. Source: [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/making_sense_tantra/pt1/making_sense_tantra_01.html] (accessed: 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thugs-rgyud'' is a synonym for ''sems rgyud''&lt;ref name="Dharma Dictionary"&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (28 December 2005). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs_rgyud] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;--''Thugs'' holds the semantic field: "Buddha-mind", "([[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]]) mind", "[[mind]]", "[[soul]]", "[[spirit]]", "purpose", "intention", "unbiased perspective", "spirituality", "responsiveness", "spiritual significance", "awareness", "primordial (state, experience)", "enlightened mind", "heart", "breast", "feelings" and is sometimes a homonym of "citta" (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (4 October 2006). Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/thugs] (accessed: 17 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thugs-rgyud'' holds the [[semantic field]] "wisdom", "transmission", "heart-mind continuum", "mind", "[continuum/ stream of mind]" and "nature of mind."

===Chinese, Korean and Japanese===
The Chinese equivalent of Sanskrit ''citta-saṃtāna'' and Tibetan ''sems-kyi rgyud'' ("mindstream") is ''xin xiangxu'' ({{zh|s=心相续|t=心相續|p=''xīn xiāngxù''|w=''hsin hsiang-hsü''}}).  According to the ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'', ''xīn xiāngxù'' means "continuance of the mental stream" (from Sanskrit ''citta-saṃtāna'' or ''citta-saṃtati''), contrasted with ''wú xiàngxù'' 無相續 "no continuity of the mental stream" (from ''asaṃtāna'' or ''asaṃdhi'') and ''shì xiāngxù'' 識相續 "stream of consciousness" (from ''vijñāna-saṃtāna'').

This compound combines ''xin'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind; thought; conscience; core" and ''xiangxu'' "succeed each other", with ''xiang'' [[Wikt:相|相]] "each other; one another; mutual; reciprocal" and ''xu'' [[Wikt:續|續]] or [[Wikt:续|续]] "continue; carry on; succeed". Thus it means "thoughts succeeding each other".

''Xin xiangxu'' is pronounced ''sim sangsok'' in [[Korean language|Korean]] and ''shin sōzoku'' in Japanese.

==Origins and development==

The notion of ''citta-santāna'' developed in later Yogacara-thought, where ''citta-santāna'' replaced the notion of [[ālayavijñāna]],{{sfn|Lusthaus|2014|p=7}} the store-house consciousness in which the karmic seeds were stored. It is not a "permanent, unchanging, transmigrating entity", like the atman, but a series of momentary consciousnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Davids, C.A.F. Rhys (1903). "The Soul-Theory in Buddhism" in ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland''. Source: [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy.htm] (accessed: Sunday 1 February 2009), pp. 587-588&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Woman's Party''' ('''NWP''') is an American women's political organization formed in 1916 to fight for [[women's suffrage]]. After achieving this goal with the 1920 adoption of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the NWP advocated for other issues including the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which is still seeking ratification today. The most prominent leader of the '''National Woman's Party''' was [[Alice Paul]].

==Overview==
The '''National Woman's Party''' was an outgrowth of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]], which had been formed in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] to fight for [[women's suffrage]]. The National Woman's Party broke from the much larger [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], which was focused on attempting to gain women's suffrage at the state level. The NWP prioritized the passage of a [[constitutional amendment]] ensuring women's suffrage throughout the United States.

==Early history==
Alice Paul was closely linked to England’s Women's Suffrage Political Union (WSPU), organized by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. While a college student in England, Paul became involved with the Pankhursts and their English suffrage campaign. During this time Alice Paul met Lucy Burns, who would go on and be a co-founder of the NWP. Although Paul was closely tied to the militant suffrage campaign in England, when she left to pursue suffrage in the United States, instead Paul pioneered civil disobedience in the United States. For example, members of the WSPU heckled members of parliament, spit on police officers, and committed arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lance, Keith|date=June 1979|title=Strategy Choices of the British Women's Social and Political Union, 1903-18|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42860512?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=60|pages=51–53|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul continued her struggle for women's equality and organized picketing of a wartime time president to maintain attention to the lack of enfranchisement for women.  Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States to fight a war for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. Similar arguments were being made in Europe, where most of the allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or soon would.

After their experience with militant suffrage work in Great Britain, [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] reunited in the United States in 1910. The two women originally were appointed to the Congressional Committee of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). In March 1913, the two women organized the first national suffrage[[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|parade]] of 5,000–8,000 women (by differing estimates)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/original-womens-march-washington-and-suffragists-who-paved-way-180961869/|title=The Original Women’s March on Washington and the Suffragists Who Paved the Way|author=Boissoneault, Lorraine|date=January 2017|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C. on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. This was designed as a political tactic to show the strength of women and to show that they would pursue their goals under Wilson’s administration. Leading the parade was Inez Milholland who wore all white and rode on a white horse, which later served as a symbol for the suffrage movement. This placement of Millholland at the start of the parade was strategic because of Mulholland's beauty, Paul knew she would attract media attention and followers. One of the criticisms of this first national suffrage parade was the barrier of colored women from participating side by side with white women. Even though Paul never opposed black women getting the right to vote, she barred them from marching with the white women and forced them to be in the back of the parade with the men to appease southern women. The parade quickly devolved into chaos due to violent reactions from the crowd and a lack of support by the local police. The D.C. police did little to help the suffragists; but the women were assisted by the Massachusetts National Guard, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and boys from the Maryland Agricultural College, who created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore Sun, March 4, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this incident, which Paul effectively used to rally public opinion to the suffrage cause, Paul and Burns founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in April 1913, which split off from NAWSA later that year. There were many reasons for the split, but primarily Paul and Burns were frustrated with the National's slower approach of focusing on individual state referendums and wanted to pursue a congressional amendment. Alice Paul had also chafed under the leadership of [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], as she had very different ideas of how to go about suffrage work, and a different attitude towards militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States|author=Flexner, Eleanor|year=1959|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-10654-7|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catt disapproved of the radical strategies, inspired by the British "Suffragettes", Paul and Burns were trying to implement into the American Suffrage Movement.

The split was confirmed by a major difference of opinion on the Shafroth-Palmer Amendment. This amendment was spearheaded by Alice Paul's replacement as chair of the National's Congressional Committee, and was a compromise of sorts meant to appease racist sentiment in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Shafroth–Palmer was to be a constitutional amendment that would require any state with more than 8 percent signing an initiative petition to hold a state referendum on suffrage. This would have kept the law-making out of federal hands, a proposition more attractive to the South.  Southern states feared a congressional women's suffrage amendment as a possible federal encroachment into their restrictive system of voting laws, meant to disenfranchise the black voter.

Paul and Burns felt that this amendment was a lethal distraction from the true and ultimately necessary goal of an all-encompassing federal amendment protecting the rights of all women—especially as the bruising rounds of state referendums were perceived at the time as almost damaging the cause. In Paul's words: "It is a little difficult to treat with seriousness an equivocating, evasive, childish substitute for the simple and dignified suffrage amendment now before Congress."{{sfnp|Adams|Keene|2008|p=103}}

==Opposition to Wilson==
[[File:Woman's Journal of March 8, 1913.jpg|thumb|right|220px|March 8, 1913 front page of ''[[Woman's Journal]]'']]

Women associated with the party staged a very innovative [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|suffrage parade on March 3, 1913]], the day before Wilson's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, Eleanor, ''Century of Struggle'', enlarged edition (1959; Harvard University Press, 1996), pp. 255–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the group's first meeting, Paul clarified that the party would not be a traditional political party and therefore would not endorse a candidate for president during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. As a result, in 1918, Paul ran a campaign that boycotted Democrats because of their refusal to support women's suffrage. They decided to boycott the entire party, including pro-suffrage Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the boycott of Democrats spearheaded by the NWP lead to a Republican majority in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/images/tactics.pdf|title=TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN’S PARTY SUFFRAGE CAMPAIGN|last=|first=|date=|website=American Memory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Woman's Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival NAWSA, under [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president.{{sfnp|Cott|1987|pp=59–61}}

==Picketing the White House==
[[Image:National Women's Party picketing the White House.jpg|left|thumb|300px|NWP members picket the [[White House]] during the [[Silent Sentinels]] protests in 1917; the banner reads, "[[Woodrow Wilson|Mr. President]], How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty."]]
The escalating conflict in Europe didn’t stop Alice Paul and the NWP from protesting Wilson’s hypocritical stance on the war. Wilson promoted the idea of maintaining democracy abroad, even though the United States still denied half of its citizens the right to vote. The NWP pickets were seen as controversial because they continued during war time and other suffrage groups like NAWSA chose to support the war effort. Known as "[[Silent Sentinels]]", their action lasted from January 10, 1917 until June 1919. The picketers were tolerated at first, but when they continued to picket after the United States declared war in 1917, they were arrested by police for obstructing traffic. Regardless of the weather, the women stood outside of the White House holding banners, constantly reminding Wilson of his hypocrisy. When they were first arrested, Lucy Burns claimed that they were political prisoners but were treated as regular prisoners.  As a tribute to their commitment to suffrage, they refused to pay the fines  and accepted prison time. The first night that the Silent Sentinels spent in jail was known as the [[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]: the prisoners were beaten until a few of them were unconscious, starved, and Burns had her hands chained above her head. Due to this unlawful detention, many of the NWP's members went on [[hunger strike]]s; some, including Lucy Burns and Paul, were force-fed by jail personnel as a consequence.Hunger strikes left the women weak and in terrible conditions, but they persisted. After a while, the guards were told to force-feed the women. They had long narrow tubes shoved down their throats, which caused many injuries that failed to heal. The suffragists were also forced to provide labor in the workhouses and were often beaten and abused. Taking advantage of the mistreatment and physical abuse, some of the suffragists shared their stories to the press and to ''The Suffragist'', their suffrage newspaper. Doris Stevens, a notable member of the NWP, wrote about their horrible experiences in the Occoquan Workhouse in her memoir ''Jailed for Freedom''. The resulting publicity was at a time when Wilson was trying to build a reputation for himself and the nation as an international leader in [[human right]]s. Many of banners featured quotes from Wilson about preserving democracy abroad, which called attention to Wilson's hypocrisy and his lack of support for a national suffrage amendment.

There are many different theories about why Wilson changed his stance of suffrage. Wilson favored  woman suffrage at the state level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided, with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-stiehm/2013/12/10/woodrow-wilson-versus-the-suffrage-movement|title=Woodrow Wilson Versus the Suffragettes|last=Steihm|first=Jamie|date=December 10, 2013|website=US NEWS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Southern state to grant women the vote was Arkansas. The NWP in 1917–1919 repeatedly targeted Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment. Wilson, however, kept in close touch with more moderate suffragists of the NAWSA. Wilson continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was in support; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him. In January 1918, Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill. The NWP had many innovative non-violent tactics including; staging sit-ins, organizing deputations of high class and working-class women, boycotting the Democrats in midterm elections, using the voting power of women in the west, appealing to Wilson everyday through picketing, and calling out Wilson for supporting world democracy but not supporting it at home, of the NWP were a contributing factor in getting Wilson to change his position on the suffrage bill. It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification.[[National Woman's Party#cite%20note-13|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Scholar Belinda A. Stillion Southard has written that "...the campaign of the NWP was crucial toward securing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment."[[National Woman's Party#cite%20note-14|&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Fighting for equal rights==
The NWP played a critical role in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1920, which granted U.S. women the right to vote. Alice Paul then turned her attention to securing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) which she felt was vital for women to secure gender equality. The NWP regrouped in1923 and published the magazine ''Equal Rights''. The publication was directed towards women but also intended to educate men about the benefits of women's suffrage, women's rights and other issues concerning American women.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Alice Paul Inst"&gt;{{cite web|author=Carol, Rebecca|author2=Myers, Kristina|author3=Lindman, Janet|title=The Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|work=Alice Paul: Feminist, Suffragist and Political Strategist|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The NWP did not support protective legislation and argued that these laws would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society. But, the NWP did support working women and their support was vital throughout their campaign for the national Amendment. Alice Paul organized many working class deputations and even sent over 400 blue collar workers to meet with Wilson. Although seen as highly controversial due to the status difference, this move showed Paul's support for all types of women, not just those of prestigious class.

After 1920, the National Woman's Party authored over 600 pieces of legislation fighting for women's equality; over 300 were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp and Verta Taylor, ''Survival in the Doldrums'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 24–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and under president [[Sarah Tarleton Colvin]], who served in 1933, pressed for equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Mrs. A.

Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and never passed.  However, in 1964 the NWP did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have "sex" added to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP.

==Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964==
In 1963 Congress passed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which prohibited wage differentials based on sex.

The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. He was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, but he supported such laws for white women.    
Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. 
[[Image:CivilRightsAct1964-HouseRollCall-Sex-Amendment.jpg|thumb|[[House Rules Committee]] clerk's record of [[markup (legislation)|markup session]] adding "sex" to bill.]] 
Historians debate Smith's motivation—was it a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, or did he support women's rights and was attempting to improve the bill by broadening it to include women?&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm|author=Freeman, Jo|title=How 'Sex' Got into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy|journal=Law and Inequality|volume=9|issue=2|date=March 1991|pages=163–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Rosenberg, ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'' (2008) p. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|author=Frum, David|authorlink=David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, NY|isbn=0-465-04195-7|pages=245–246, 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=cbpubs|title=A Tale of Two Amendments: The Reasons Congress Added Sex to Title VII and Their Implication for the Issue of Comparable Worth|author=Gold, Michael Evan|year=1981|work=Faculty Publications – Collective Bargaining, Labor Law, and Labor History|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith asserted that he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. [[Martha Griffiths]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynne Olson|Olson, Lynne]] (2001). ''Freedom's daughters: the unsung heroines of the civil rights movement'', p.&amp;nbsp;360.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.&lt;ref name="Gold"/&gt; For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment—with no linkage to racial issues—in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially Paul. She and other activists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosalind Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Rosalind]] (2008). ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'', p.&amp;nbsp;187 notes that Smith had been working for years with two Virginia feminists on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws "protecting" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia (1989). ''On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968'', p.&amp;nbsp;179&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats.  However, in 1964 the NWP and Pauli Murray did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have "sex" added to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP. [[Pauli Murray]] was also instrumental in the inclusion of sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act prohibits the discrimination based on sex, which has been attributed to the betterment of women as a group.

''[[The Suffragist]]'' newspaper was founded by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in 1913. It was referred to as "the only women's political newspaper in the United States" and was published to promote women's suffrage activities.{{r|Suffragist}} The Suffragist would follow weekly events and promote different views held by the leaders of the NWP. Its articles had political cartoons, by [[Nina E.

==Legacy==
The Nineteenth amendment, which prohibits the denial of the right to vote on the basis of sex, became the law of the land when it was ratified by a sufficient number of states in 1920. Many African American women and men in the Jim Crow South, however, remained disenfranchised after the ratification of this amendment until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Today, the National Woman's Party exists as a 501c3 educational organization. Its task is now the maintenance and interpretation of the collection and archives of the historic National Woman's Party. The NWP operates out of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, where objects from the collection are exhibited. The legacy that this group left behind is mixed. On one hand Alice Paul and the NWP were one of the reasons that the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, but on the other hand the party was flawed for their lack of inclusion of black women and their refusal to help black women gain the right to vote. To keep the support of southern members of the NWP, Paul refused to bring up the issue of race in the south. Her single-minded focus on the ERA caused her to refuse to fight the Jim Crow Laws barring black women the right to vote. Historian Nancy Cott has noted that as the party moved into the 1920s it remained ideologically consistent in the pursuit of a solitary goal for women and that:
it remained an autocratically run, single-minded and single-issue pressure group, still reliant on getting into the newspapers as a means of publicizing its cause, very insistent on the method of "getting in touch with the key men."...NWP lobbyists went straight to legislators, governors, and presidents, not to their constituents.

In 1972 Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed. Even though the expiration date has passed for this Amendment, recently a few states have ratified it symbolically. Although Alice Paul didn’t live to see her hard work pay off, her legacy lives on in the continued struggle to ratify the ERA.

In [[philosophy]], the '''natural order''' is the [[morality|moral]] source from which [[natural law]] seeks to derive its [[authority]].  Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of [[law]], which natural law attempts to reinforce. This is related to [[Dharma]].

In contrast, [[divine law]] seeks authority from [[God]], and [[Jurisprudence|positive law]] seeks authority from [[government]].

The term is used by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] in his book, ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed|Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]]'', to defend [[anarcho-capitalism]].

The term is used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17790">The '''obstetrical dilemma''' is a hypothesis to explain why humans often require assistance from other humans during [[childbirth]] to avoid complications, whereas most non-human primates give birth alone with relatively little difficulty. The obstetrical dilemma posits that this is due to the biological [[trade-off]] imposed by two opposing [[evolutionary pressure]]s in the development of the human [[pelvis]]. As human ancestor species (hominids) developed bipedal locomotion (the ability to walk upright), decreasing the size of the bony birth canal, they also developed ever larger [[skull]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;, which required a wider obstetrical pelvic area to accommodate this trend in hominid infants.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref name=evolutionaryorigins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittman | first1 = A.

== History ==
The term, obstetrical dilemma, was coined in 1960, by Sherwood Lerned Washburn ([[Sherwood Washburn|SL Washburn]]), a prominent early American physical anthropologist, in order to describe the evolutionary development of the human pelvis and its relation to childbirth and pregnancy in hominids and non-human primates.&lt;ref name="roulette"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = J. C. K. | last2 = Desilva | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Stock | first3 = J.

==Evolution of human birth==
[[File:A Visual Comparison of the Pelvis and Bony Birth Canal Vs. the Size of Infant Skull in Primate Species.png|thumb|upright=1.75|The diagram compares the size and shape of the pelvis as the infant's skull must move through it for the Chimpanzee, ''Australopithecus afarensis'' and ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. This comparison is one of the pieces of evidence physical anthropologists use to support the Obstetrical Dilemma hypothesis]]

=== Human pelvis ===
The obstetrical dilemma hypothesizes that when hominids began to develop bipedal locomotion, the conflict between these two opposing evolutionary pressures became greatly exacerbated. Because humans are currently the only recognized extant obligately bipedal primates, meaning our body shape requires to only use two legs, major evolutionary developments had to occur in order to alter to the shape of the female pelvis.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; Human males evolved narrower hips optimized for locomotion, whereas female hips evolved to be a wider optimization because of childbirthing needs.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bipedalism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = K. | last2 = Trevathan | first2 = W. | year = 2005 | title = Bipedalism and human birth: The obstetrical dilemma revisited | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 161–168 | doi = 10.1002/evan.1360040506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/30/childbirth-metabolic-rate-obstetric-dilemma "Why must childbirth be such hard labour?   New evidence about why women give birth when they do has turned received opinion on its head by Alice Roberts, 2013-06-30"].&lt;/ref&gt; Human pelvises have no distinguishing skeletal markers for sex before puberty, meanwhile, with maturation, hormones and obstetrical demands alter the shape of the pelvis in females. Overall, through evolution of the species, a number of structures in the body have changed size, proportion, or location in order to accommodate bipedal locomotion and allow a person to stand upright and face forward. To help support the upper body, a number of structural changes were made to the pelvis. The ilial pelvic bone shifted forward and broadened, while the ischial pelvic bone shrank, narrowing the pelvic canal. These changes were occurring at the same time as humans were developing larger craniums.

=== Adaptations to ensure live birth ===
Early human ancestors, hominids, originally gave birth in a similar way that non-human primates do because early obligate quadrupedal individuals would have retained similar skeletal structure to great apes. Most non-human primates today have neonatal heads that are close in size to the mother’s birth canal, as evidenced by observing female primates who do not need assistance in birthing, often seeking seclusion away from others of their species.&lt;ref name="allomaternalcare"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Isler | first1 = Karin | last2 = van Schaik | first2 = Caret | year = 2012 | title = Allomaternal care, life history, and brain size evolution in mammals | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 52–63 | doi = 10.1097/01.ogx.0000286584.04310.5c }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern humans, [[Birth|parturition]] (childbirth) differs greatly from the rest of the primates because of both pelvic shape of the mother and neonatal shape of the infant. Further adaptations evolved to cope with bipedalism and larger craniums were also important such as neonatal rotation of the infant, shorter gestation length, assistance with birth, and a malleable neonatal head.


==== Neonatal rotation ====
During delivery neonatal rotation occurs when the body gets rotated to align head and shoulders transversely when entering the small pelvis (internal rotation) and then longitudinally to exit the birth canal (external rotation). This is an important mechanism because growth in the size of the cranium as well as the width of the shoulders makes it more difficult for the infant to fit through the pelvis.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; This differs in non-human primates as there is no need for neonatal rotation in non-human primates because the birth canal is wide enough to accommodate the infant.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = Karen | last2 = Trevathan | first2 = Wenda | year = 2003 | title = Birth, obstetrics and human evolution| journal = BJOG| volume = 109 | issue = 11| pages = 1199–1206 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-0528.2002.00010.x | pmid = 12452455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gestation length and altriciality ====
Gestation length in humans is shorter than most other primates. It is thought that this shorter gestation period is an adaptation to ensure the survival of mother and child because it leads to [[altricial]]ity. The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis suggests that in order to successfully undergo childbirth, the infant must be born earlier and earlier, thereby making the child increasingly developmentally premature.&lt;ref name="dunsworth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunsworth | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Warrener | first2 = A. G. | last3 = Deacon | first3 = T. | last4 = Ellison | first4 = P.

Humans are born with an underdeveloped brain; only 25% of their brains fully developed at birth as opposed to non-human primates where the infant is born with 45–50% brain development.&lt;ref&gt;Trevathan, Wenda (2011).

==== Social assistance ====
Human infants are also almost always born with assistance from other humans because of the way that the pelvis is shaped. Since the pelvis and opening of birth canal face backwards, humans have difficulty giving birth themselves because they cannot guide the baby out of the canal. Non-human primates seek seclusion when giving birth because they do not need any help due to the pelvis and opening being more forward.&lt;ref name="rosenberg" /&gt; Human infants depend on their parents much more and for much longer than other primates.&lt;ref name="bipedalism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dunsworth" /&gt; Humans spend a lot of their time caring for their children as they develop whereas other species stand on their own from when they are born. The faster an infant develops, the higher the reproductive output of a female can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Leigh | first2 = S.R. | year = 1997 | title = Ontogenetic variation in small-bodied new world primates | url = | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1159/000157226 | pmid = 9170641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So in humans, the cost of slow development of their infants is that humans reproduce relatively slowly. This phenomenon is also known as [[cooperative breeding]].

==== Malleable cranium ====
Humans are born with a very malleable fetal head which is not fully developed when the infant exits the womb.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; This soft spot on the crown of the infant allows for the head to be compressed in order to better fit through the birth canal without obstructing it.&lt;ref name="bipedalism" /&gt; This allows for the head to develop more after birth and for the cranium to continue growing without affecting the birthing process.

==Challenges to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis==

The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has had several challenges to it, as more data is collected and analysized. Several different fields of study have taken an interest in understanding more about the human birth process and that of human ancestor species.

=== Early brain growth rates ===

Some studies have shown that higher brain growth rates happen earlier on in [[ontogeny]] than previously thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Leon | first1 = Ponce | last2 = Marcia | first2 =  | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Neanderthal brain size at birth proves insights into the evolution of human life history | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 13764–13768 | pmid = 18779579 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0803917105 | pmc=2533682}}&lt;/ref&gt; which challenges the idea that the explanation of the obstetrical dilemma is that humans are born with underdeveloped brains. This is because if brain growth rates were largest in early development, that is when the brain size would increase the most. Premature birth would not allow for a much larger head size if most of the growth had already happened. Also, it has been suggested that maternal pelvic dimensions are sensitive to some ecological factors.

=== Maternal heat stress ===

There has been a lot of evidence linking body mass to brain mass and determining maternal metabolism as a key factor in the growth of the fetus. Maternal constraints could be largely due to thermal stress or energy available. A larger brain mass in the neonate corresponds to more energy needed to sustain it. It takes much more energy for the mother if the brain fully develops in the womb. If maternal energy is the limiting factor then an infant can only grow as much as the mother can sustain. Also, because fetal size is positively correlated to maternal energy use, thermal stress is an issue because the larger the fetus the more the mother can suffer heat stress.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;

=== Environmental effects ===

Additional studies suggest that other factors may further complicate the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis. One of these is dietary shifts, possibly due to the emergence of agriculture. This can be both due to change in diet as well as the increase in population density since agriculture was developed; more people leads to more disease.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt; Studies have also been done in twins to show that pelvic size may be due more to the environment in which they live than their genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = Krishan | year = 2002 | title = Genetic basis of human female pelvic morphology: A twin study | url = | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 327–333 | pmid = 11920368 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.10055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study disproves the thought that narrower hips are optimized for locomotion because it was found that a Late Stone Age population Southern Africa that survived largely on terrestrial mobility had women who had uncharacteristically small body size with large pelvic canals.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;

=== Hormones ===
Moreover, the pelvis has the most favorable morphology for obstetrics between ages 25 and 30. Given that those are the ages of highest fertility, it may indicate that sex-biased autosomal gene expression, regulated by sex-specific hormones and sensitivity of hormone receptors, may obstruct the birth outside of that age range.

=== Energetics of gestation and growth hypothesis ===

The energetics of gestation and growth (EGG) hypothesis offers a direct challenge to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, equating the constraints on gestation and parturition to the energy restrictions of the mother. It has been shown that using both professional athletes and pregnant women, there is an upper limitation to the amount of energy a woman can produce before it cause deleterious effects: approximately 2.1x their basal metabolic rate. During pregnancy the growing brain mass and length in the neonate correspond to more energy needed to sustain it. This results in a competing balance between the fetus’s demand for energy and the maternal ability to meet that demand. At approximately 9 months gestation, the fetus’s energy needs surpasses the mother’s energy limitation, correlating with the average time of birth.&lt;ref name="dunsworth" /&gt; The newly born infant can then be sustained on breast milk, which is a more efficient, less energy demanding mechanism of nutrient transfer between mother and child.&lt;ref name="kane"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = Sunanda V. | last2 = Acquah | first2 = Letitia A. | year = 2009 | title = Placenta transport of Immunoglobulins: A Clinical Review for Gastroenterologist Who Prescribe Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies to Women During Conception and Pregnancy | url = | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 228–33 | pmid = 19098873 | doi=10.1038/ajg.2008.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this hypothesis demonstrates that, contrary to the obstetrical dilemma, an increased pelvic size would not be deleterious to bipedalism. Studying the running mechanics of males and females, it was shown that an increased pelvic size related to neither an increased metabolic nor structural demand on a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warrener|first=Lisa|last2=Lewton|first2=Kristi L.|last3=Pontzer|first3=Herman|last4=Lieberman|first4=Daniel E.|date=March 1, 2015|title=A Wider Pelvis Does Not Increase Locomotor Cost in Humans, with Implications for the Evolution of Childbirth|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=101839944&amp;site=eds-live|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118903 |pmid=|access-date=July 19, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obstetrical dilemma revisited ===
The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has also been challenged conceptually based on new studies. The authors argue that the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis assumes that human, and therefore hominid, childbirth has been a painful and dangerous experience through the species' evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Pamela K.|date=January 25, 2016|title=Biocultural Perspectives on Maternal Mortality and Obstetrical Death From the Past to the Present|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22906|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=159|issue=S61|pmid=26808103|pages=150–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption may be fundamentally false as many early analyses focused on maternal death data from primarily females of European-descent in Western Europe and the United States during the 19th and 20th century, a limited population in a time of great change. The study suggests the increase in maternal mortality during this time period was not due to evolutionary limitations as the creators of the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis thought, but due to the increased use of medical intervention, the medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth and restrictive socio-cultural practices of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a recent study a covariation between human pelvis shape, stature, and head size is reported. It is said that females with a large head possess a birth canal that can better accommodate large-headed neonates. Mothers with large heads usually give birth to neonates with large heads. Therefore, the detected pattern of covariation contributes to ease childbirth and has likely evolved in response to strong correlational selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Mitteroecker | first2 = Philipp | year = 2015 | title = Covariation between human pelvis shape, stature, and head size alleviates the obstetric dilemma | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5655.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = PNAS | volume = 112 | issue = 18| pages = 5655–5660 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1420325112| pmc = 4426453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8219">In [[mathematics]], '''obstruction theory''' is a name given to two different [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]], both of which yield [[cohomological]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]].

In the original work of [[Eduard Stiefel|Stiefel]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]], [[characteristic class]]es were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent [[Vector field|vector]]s. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a [[Section (fiber bundle)|cross-section]] of a [[Fiber bundle|bundle]].

==In homotopy theory==
The older meaning for obstruction theory in [[homotopy theory]] relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a [[continuous mapping]] defined on a [[simplicial complex]], or [[CW complex]]. It is traditionally called ''Eilenberg obstruction theory'', after [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It involves [[cohomology group]]s with coefficients in [[homotopy group]]s to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex ''X'' to another, ''Y'', defined initially on the [[0-skeleton]] of ''X'' (the vertices of ''X''), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same [[path-connected]] component of ''Y''. Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary. 

At some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' to the n-skeleton of ''X'', this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}} of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an [[cohomology|n-cochain]]  with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a '''cocyle''' and so defines a [[cohomology]] class in the nth cohomology group of ''X'' with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of ''X''.  If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton.

===Obstruction to extending a section of a principal bundle===

====Construction====
Suppose that {{mvar|B}} is a [[simply connected]] simplicial complex and that {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is a [[fibration]] with fiber {{mvar|F}}.  Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math| ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''}} on the [[N-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] of {{mvar|B}}.

For every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex {{mvar|Δ}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]]).  Because {{mvar|p}} send each of these back to each {{mvar|Δ}}, we have a map from an {{mvar|n}}-sphere to {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}}. Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and {{mvar|Δ}} is [[Contractible space|contractible]]; {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}} is [[homotopy equivalent]] to {{mvar|F}}. So this partially defined section assigns an element of [[homotopy group|{{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}]] to every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex.  This is precisely the data of a {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}-valued [[simplicial homology|simplicial]] [[cohomology#definition|cochain]] of degree {{math|''n'' + 1}} on {{mvar|B}}, i.e. an element of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(B; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}}.  This cochain is called the '''obstruction cochain''' because it being the zero means that all of these elements of {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}} are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each {{mvar|Δ}}) and the constant map.

The fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from the all the boundaries of all the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle.  If one started with a different partially defined section {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that agreed with the original on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary.  Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}} such that if a partially defined section on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial.

The converse is also true if one allows such things as ''homotopy sections'', i.e. a map {{math|''σ'' : ''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p'' ∘ ''σ''}} is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on {{mvar|B}}.  Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton.

====Applications====
* By inducting over {{mvar|n}}, one can construct a ''first obstruction to a section'' as the first of the above cohomology classes that is non-zero. 
* This can be used to find obstructions to trivializations of [[principal bundle#Trivializations and cross sections|principal bundles]].
* Because [[homotopy fiber|any map can be turned into a fibration]], this construction can be used to see if there are obstructions to the existence of a lift (up to homotopy) of a map into {{mvar|B}} to a map into {{mvar|E}} even if {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is not a fibration.
* It is crucial to the construction of [[Postnikov system]]s.

==In geometric topology==
In [[geometric topology]], obstruction theory is concerned with when a [[topological manifold]] has a [[piecewise linear structure]], and when a piecewise linear manifold has a [[differential structure]].

In dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Moise), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same.

In dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide.

==In surgery theory==
The two basic questions of [[surgery theory]] are whether a topological space with ''n''-dimensional [[Poincaré duality]] is [[homotopy equivalent]] to an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]], and also whether a [[homotopy equivalence]] of ''n''-dimensional manifolds is [[homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]. In both cases there are two obstructions for ''n&gt;9'', a primary [[topological K-theory]] obstruction to the existence of a [[vector bundle]]: if this vanishes there exists a [[normal invariant|normal map]], allowing the definition of the secondary [[surgery theory|surgery obstruction]] in [[L-theory|algebraic L-theory]] to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a [[homotopy equivalence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4029">The '''omission bias''' is an alleged type of [[cognitive bias]]. It is the tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral than equally harmful omissions (inactions) because actions are more obvious than inactions. It is contentious as to whether this represents a systematic error in thinking, or is supported by a substantive [[moral theory]]. For a [[consequentialist]], judging harmful actions as worse than inaction would indeed be inconsistent, but [[deontological]] ethics may, and normally does, draw a moral distinction between doing and allowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Frances |last= Howard-Snyder|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/doing-allowing/|title= Doing vs. Allowing Harm|edition=|year=2011|journal=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias is usually showcased through the [[trolley problem]].

==Examples and applications==

Spranca, Minsk and Baron extended the omission bias to judgments of morality of choices. In one scenario, John, a tennis player, would be facing a tough opponent the next day in a decisive match. John knows his opponent is allergic to a food substance. Subjects were presented with two conditions: John recommends the food containing the allergen to hurt his opponent's performance, or the opponent himself orders the allergenic food, and John says nothing. A majority of people judged that John's action of recommending the allergenic food as being more immoral than John's inaction of not informing the opponent of the allergenic substance.&lt;ref name="SprancaMinsk1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spranca|first1=Mark|last2=Minsk|first2=Elisa|last3=Baron|first3=Jonathan|title=Omission and commission in judgment and choice|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=27|issue=1|year=1991|pages=76–105| url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/oc.html| doi=10.1016/0022-1031(91)90011-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect has also held in real world athletic arenas: NBA statistics showcased referees called 50 percent fewer fouls in the final moments of close games.&lt;ref name="MoskowitzWertheim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Tobias|last2=Wertheim|first2=L.

An additional real-world example is when parents decide not to vaccinate their children because of the potential chance of death—even when the [[probability]] the vaccination will cause death is much less likely than death from the disease prevented.&lt;ref name="RitovBaron1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritov|first1=Ilana|last2=Baron|first2=Jonathan|title=Reluctance to vaccinate: Omission bias and ambiguity|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=3|issue=4|year=1990|pages=263–277|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960030404|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/vac.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parallel thinking''' is a term coined by [[Edward de Bono]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward De Bono, ''Parallel thinking: from Socratic thinking to de Bono thinking'', Viking 1994 {{ISBN|0-670-85126-4}}, page x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frame&gt;David Moseley, Vivienne Baumfield, Julian Elliott, ''Frameworks for thinking: a handbook for teaching and learning'', Cambridge University Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-84831-8}}, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel thinking is described as a constructive alternative to: "adversarial thinking"; [[debate]]; and the approaches exemplified by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle (whom de Bono refers to as the "Greek gang of three" (GG3) &lt;ref&gt;Edward de Bono coined the term "The gang of three" to refer to three Greek philosophers: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle - [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/apr/24/highereducationprofile.academicexperts see Guardian article April 24th 2007] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Edward De Bono, ''Parallel thinking: from Socratic thinking to de Bono thinking'', Viking 1994
{{ISBN|0-670-85126-4}}, page 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;). In general parallel thinking is a further development of the well known [[lateral thinking]] processes, focusing even more on explorations—looking for ''what can be'' rather than for ''what is''.

==Definition==
Parallel thinking is defined as a thinking process where focus is split in specific directions. When done in a group it effectively avoids the consequences of the [[adversarial]] approach (as used in courts).

In adversarial debate, the objective is to [[Proof (truth)|prove]] or [[disprove]] statements put forward by the parties (normally two). This is also known as the [[dialectic]] approach. In Parallel Thinking, practitioners put forward as many statements as possible in several (preferably more than two) parallel tracks. This leads to ''exploration'' of a subject where all participants can contribute, in parallel, with knowledge, facts, feelings, etc.

Crucial to the method is that the process is done in a disciplined manner, and that all participants play along and contribute ''in parallel''. Thus each participant must stick to the specific track.

For any [[complex number]] written in polar form (such as ''r''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]&lt;sup&gt;[[imaginary unit|i]]''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;), the '''phase factor''' is the [[complex exponential]] factor (e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;).  As such, the term "phase factor" is related to the more general term [[phasor]], which may have any magnitude (i.e., not necessarily part of the [[circle group]]).  The phase factor is a [[unit complex number]], i.e., of [[absolute value]] [[1 (number)|1]].  It is commonly used in quantum mechanics.  

The variable ''θ'' appearing in such an expression is generally referred to as the [[phase (waves)|phase]].  Multiplying the equation of a [[plane wave]] ''A''e&lt;sup&gt;i('''k·r'''−''ωt'')&lt;/sup&gt; by a phase factor [[phase shift|shifts the phase]] of the wave by ''θ'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{e}^{i\theta}A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t}\right)} = A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t + \theta}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[quantum mechanics]], a phase factor is a complex coefficient e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; that multiplies a [[Bra-ket notation|ket]] &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or [[bra–ket notation|bra]] &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;. It does not, in itself, have any physical meaning, since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a [[Hermitian operator]].  That is, the values of &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|A|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|e^{-i\theta} A e^{i\theta}|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Messiah|1999|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''differences'' in phase factors between two interacting [[quantum state]]s can sometimes be measurable (such as in the [[Berry phase]]) and this can have important consequences.

In [[optics]], the phase factor is an important quantity in the treatment of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">'''Popper's three worlds''' is a way of looking at [[reality]], described by the British philosopher [[Karl Popper]] in a lecture in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80.pdf Three Worlds by Karl Popper - The Tanner Lecture on Human Values] - Delivered by Karl Popper at The University of Michigan on April 7, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept involves three interacting worlds, called '''World 1''', '''World 2''' and '''World 3'''.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Michael. ''Philosophy in Science: An Historical Introduction''. Springer, 2011, p. 118ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worlds 1, 2 and 3==
Popper split the world into three categories:

* World 1: the world of physical [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[event (philosophy)|event]]s, including [[biology|biological]] entities
* World 2: the world of [[mind|mental]] objects and events
* World 3: objective knowledge

==The interaction of World 1 and World 2==
The theory of interaction between World 1 and World 2 is an alternative theory to [[Cartesian dualism]], which is based on the theory that the universe is composed of two essential substances: ''[[res cogitans]]'' and ''[[res extensa]]''. Popperian cosmology rejects this [[essentialism]], but maintains the common sense view that physical and mental states exist, and they interact.

==World 3==
Popper's World 3 contains the products of thought. This includes abstract [[object (philosophy)|object]]s such as [[scientific theories]], [[narrative|stories]], [[mythology|myth]]s, [[tool]]s, [[Institution|social institutions]], and works of art.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; World 3 is not to be conceived as a [[Platonic realm]], because it is created by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Charles Jarvie, Karl Milford, David W. Miller (eds.), ''Karl Popper: Metaphysics and epistemology'', Ashgate Publishing, 2006, p. 61: "the most important difference between platonism and Popper is the fact that World 3 is created by human beings..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interaction of World 2 and World 3==
The interaction of World 2 and World 3 is based on the theory that World 3 is partially autonomous. For example, the development of [[scientific theories]] in World 3 leads to [[unintended consequence]]s, in that problems and contradictions are discovered by World 2. Another example is that the process of [[learning]] causes World 3 to change World 2.

==The interaction of World 1 and World 3==
Other entities are contained in World 3, such as feats of [[engineering]] and [[art]]. The World 3 objects, although they exist in World 1, are embodied and given extra meaning by World 3. For example, the intrinsic value of [[Hamlet]] as a World 3 object is embodied many times in World 1, the physical world. This idea would be something along the lines of a [[Meta|meta-object]], or a [[Intelligible form|form]] of [[being]].

==The interaction of World 1, World 2 and World 3==
As a pluralist, laid out in his Tanner Lecture, Popper views interactions between all three worlds as a matter of course. This is similar to the linkages made by William Kirk between the 'phenomenal environment' of physical facts and social facts and decisions made in the 'behavioural environment'. &lt;ref&gt; Kirk, William, 1963 ''Problems of geography, Geography'',1963, 48, 4, p. 357-371&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt; Kirk, William, 1989 'Historical geography and the concept of the behavioural environment' In The behavioural Environment, eds Boal, F.W and Livingstone, D.N. Ch 2, 18-30&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion between Popper's three worlds and Kirk's views has been made by Bird &lt;ref&gt;Bird, J.H. 'Geography in three worlds: How Popper's system can help elucidate dichotomies and changes in the discipline' The Professional Geographer, 1985, 37, 4, 403-409&lt;/ref&gt; who also discusses the three worlds in relation to methodological implications for geography. &lt;ref&gt;Bird, J.H. 'Methodological implications for geography from the philosophy of KR Popper' Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1975, 91, 3, 153-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Predator''''' film series is a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise|franchise]] based on a race of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|fictional extraterrestrials]] created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas. Produced by [[20th Century Fox]], the series started in 1987 with the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', which led to two sequels and [[novel]], [[comic book]], and [[video game]] spin-offs. Related to the franchise is the [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'']], which combine the eponymous [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] with [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|the creatures]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' film series]].

==Background==
''Predator'' was [[John McTiernan]]'s first studio film as director. The studio hired screenplay writer [[Shane Black]] to not only play a supporting role in the film, but to keep an eye on McTiernan due to the director's inexperience. [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the film's creature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletext.co.uk/bigscreen/your-film-views/2c716751d7abb28f897edd93c630b4ef/Vortex+Van+Damme+in+Predator.aspx |title=Teletext Big Screen Vortex |publisher=Teletext.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the creature an agile, [[ninja]]-esque hunter. When compared to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Carl Weathers]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], actors known for their bodybuilding regimes, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening. Eventually, Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the actor and mime artist [[Kevin Peter Hall]].

The predator creature's design is credited to special effects artist [[Stan Winston]]. While flying to [[Japan]] with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, "I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]]". Winston then included them in his designs. Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.

The film's creature was originally designed with a long neck, a [[dog]]-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s ''Boss Film Creature Shop''. However, with problems filming the creature in Mexico and attempts to create a convincing monster of Van Damme, wearing a much different body suit, failing, makeup effects responsibilities were given to Winston and his studio, [[R/Greenberg Associates]]. According to former ''Boss Film Creature Shop'' makeup supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} length extensions that gave the creature a backward bent [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of [[Palenque, Mexico]], the production had to shut down so that Winston could make the new creature. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks.

The sound of the creature was provided by [[Peter Cullen]]. Despite his resolution not to voice any more monsters following injuries to his throat sustained during the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated Dialogue Replacement / post-sync|ADR]] of [[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]], his agent convinced him to audition. The bubbling sound was inspired by a mixture of the visual of the creature and his recollection of a dying horseshoe crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62478 |title=Prime Directive: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Cullen |publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R/Greenberg Associates created the film's optical effects, including the creature's ability to become [[invisible]], its [[thermal vision]] point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the [[electric spark]] effects. The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone in a bright [[Chroma key|red suit]] (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, [[infrared film]] could not be used because it did not register in the range of [[body temperature]] [[wavelength]]s. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick|chem-lite sticks]] used by campers. The electrical sparks were [[rotoscoped]] animation using white paper pin registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were [[compositing|composited]] by the optical crew for the finished effects.

Also, in an interview on ''Predator'' Special Edition, actor Carl Weathers said many of the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3 a.m. to work out before the day's shooting, in order to look "pumped" during the scene. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after all the other actors were nowhere to be seen. It was reported that actor [[Sonny Landham]] was so unstable on the set that a bodyguard was hired; not to protect Landham, but to protect the other cast members from him.

According to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding as he had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the creature's suit. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and off-balance.

The film was particularly successful and subsequently inspired a number of [[comic books]], [[video games]] and popular anecdotes within the media. Schwarzenegger was asked to reprise his role in a ''Predator'' sequel, but was already attached to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and could not accept the role. The character was rewritten from the developing sequel's script, and the sequel to ''Predator'', directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], was scheduled for 1990.

Due to excessive violence, ''[[Predator 2]]'' was the first film to be given the newly instituted [[NC-17]] rating in the United States. It was eventually rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after being re-cut to its final theatrical length. The film cast [[Danny Glover]] in the lead role, and reprised Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Also, returning to the role of [[List of Predator characters#Anna|Anna]] in the sequel, [[Elpidia Carrillo]] was slated to be in two scenes but was cut back to a brief appearance on a video screen in the government agents' surveillance trailer. Her character is showing damage to the [[Central America]]n jungle caused by the explosion at the conclusion of the first film

===Future installments===
The producer, [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], says that ''The Predator'' will set up two sequels that he hopes Shane Black will return to direct. About this, Black said: "I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take one day at a time, in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/the-predator-reboot-shane-black-1202874827/&lt;/ref&gt; The box office results of The Predator in China may encourage 20th Century Fox to press on with another sequel.

==Crossover series==
{{Main|Alien vs. Predator}}

Inspired by the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series, the filmmakers of ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990) incorporated an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in which an Alien skull was seen in a Predator trophy case. Expansions upon this [[Shared fictional universe|shared universe]] between the ''Alien'' and ''Predator'' franchises followed, through comics and video games, until a film franchise was launched with the release of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' in 2004, followed by the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007, which spawned various new comics, novels, video games, and other merchandise based upon or inspired by the films.

===''Alien vs. Predator'' (2004)===
{{main|Alien vs. Predator (film)}}

In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in [[Earth]] orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on [[Bouvet Island|Bouvetøya]], an island about one thousand miles north of [[Antarctica]]. A buried [[pyramid]] giving off a "heat bloom" attracts a group of explorers led by Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien.  The third Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa "Lex" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually battles with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|Chestburster]] was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.

===''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007)===
{{main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem}}

Set immediately after the events of the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to "clean up" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the ''Alien'' films.

Ride-sharing is defined as multiple persons, not related to one another, using the same transportation, typically a car, to reach their respective destinations. People can share rides on a short notice, which increases the efficiency of travel. Most often, the riders are not related to one another, and the shared vehicle will eventually reach each rider's destination, as they are in close enough proximity that traveling together is efficient. Ride-share platforms offer a platform where drivers and riders can connect, agree on a pre-determined price calculated by the application, wait time, and location of driver, essentially a way to contact their driver and gain travel information without having to release personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Robert|date=January 2017|title=The Ridesharing Revolution: Economic Survey and Synthesis|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ridesharing-oup-1117-v6-brookings1.pdf|journal=More Equal By Design: Economic design responses to inequality|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ride-sharing is different than [[Carpool|carpooling]] because the main objective of carpooling is that the driver most likely related to those who are receiving the ride and are purposely recruited for the benefit of the shared parties. Additionally, ride-sharing is mainly hailed through mobile applications, something that sets it apart from normal carpooling, which is primarily set up based on people who already know one another.

Ride-sharing is primarily accessed through a mobile application, and because of this, there are several dangers that could lead to an infringement of the user's privacy and their personal information. Mostly, ride-sharing privacy is relevant to a user's location because of the app's ability to pinpoint in live time a user's position. Ride sharing applications primarily use [[Location-based service|location-based services (LBS)]] in order to be able to trace the user's location. With location sharing services, there is a need to address privacy protection while still maintaining high accuracy in location pinpointing. Unlike how in online transactions there is a third party or some sort of secure form of transaction, location sharing services cannot follow this same standard. Someone’s privacy could also be in danger because of the ride-share applications' current tracking of the user's location or tracing an IP address so the user does not even have to voluntarily input information about their location, yet they are still being tracked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pingley|first=Aniket|last2=Yu|first2=Wei|last3=Zhang|first3=Nan|last4=Fu|first4=Xinwen|last5=Zhao|first5=Wei|date=2012-07|title=A context-aware scheme for privacy-preserving location-based services|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2012.03.022|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=11|pages=2551–2568|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.03.022|issn=1389-1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the user data of locations they interact with falls into the wrong hands, a potential abuse of the data whether that be creating an online profile based on cumulative data of the individual or companies able to share personal information around multiple sources could arise.

There have been several proposed solutions to the applications in order to try and alter the side-effects of LBS. The amount of protection has to be catered differently than another application because of the real time location aspect. Factors are always changing in real time, so these services cannot accurately update if it is limited to what data it is able to access, but they are good starts being able to try and eliminate these issues in the future.

== History ==
Ride-sharing as a concept has been around since World War II.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Nelson D.|last2=Shaheen|first2=Susan A.|date=2012-01|title=Ridesharing in North America: Past, Present, and Future|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt3qm8k0c5/qt3qm8k0c5.pdf|journal=Transport Reviews|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=93–112|doi=10.1080/01441647.2011.621557|issn=0144-1647|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until around 1990s when programs were starting to digitalize, although the concept had long been established since. Some of the first telephone-based ride-matching programs were Bellevue Smart Traveler from The [[University of Washington]], Los Angeles Smart Traveler from Los Angeles's Commuter Transportation Services, and Rideshare Express from Sacramento Rideshare.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; However, in these telephone-based programs the operational costs started exceeding their revenues and an alternative, internet and email driven ride-matches, was proposed. This program was tested on a closed campus, and it was only available to University of Washington related people, which proved highly successful. Two other programs, ATHENA and MINERVA were both computerized but faced unsuccessful endings.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;*additional citation* When the internet was created in the 1990s, online ride-matching was created. Websites originally had lists or forums that people could get information for carpooling options from, but the internet provided the ability to develop platforms, which were more dynamic and interactive. Yet, this concept did not kick-start because the mechanics were not any different than traditional carpooling, only the ability to find them had been made easier. Since carpooling and ride-sharing were not a very popular option, the smaller population who did participate already had set agendas so timing wise it was not helpful to those who needed transportation outside of a regular workday commute. Larger scale companies started becoming interested in partnering with ride-matching companies in order to spread the ride-sharing platform which are gaining more traction as availability of mobile technology and thus accessibility not from a stationary point is becoming more prominent.

== User input/privacy with software data ==
=== Software ===
==== User Input Features ====
Ride-sharing applications have several user input features:

* Users can input their pick-up destination.
* Users can input their drop-off destination.
* Users can save a home or work address.
* Users can save unique places if they are visited frequently.
* Users can also pinpoint their exact location on a map.
* Users can save their credit card information for easy access.
* Users can invite their friends which the app pulls from their phone contact information.
* Users can create their own profile.
* Users can see the profiles of their potential drivers as well as any reviews that come with it.

Ride-sharing companies also have several tracking features that are unclear in terms of what user information is being collected:

* The application automatically connects and tracks the user's current location and surrounding areas, so when the app opens, an accurate map is immediately opened as the home page and the location of the user are immediately tracked.
* Recent addresses that have been set as either pick-up or drop-off locations are in kept in the search history.
* Letting the app connect to personal data that is stored in the phone, such as access to contacts, can let the app access more than just phone numbers (addresses, personal information) which have been stored under the contact in the phone.

==== Uber Privacy ====
Uber has an option where user privacy can potentially be forgotten and they are aware of what data they are collecting from the user and are being transparent *citation*:

* Ability to share or un-share live location as well as having location settings always on.
* Ability to receive notifications about your account and trip.
* Ability to remove stored contacts which adds on another way that can link two people together if someone is tracking someone's information.
* Ability to share trip details with 911 in case of emergency.
* Ability to sync personal calendar with the app.

==== Lyft Privacy ====

=== Hardware ===
==== Camera inside the car ====
Very recently has the presence of physical cameras been implemented in ride-share vehicles. Prior to this, the only time cameras were related to cars were traffic cameras and police cars. However, there has been a rise in the amount of continuous-recording cameras that are not just surveilling the road and keeping track of what happens outside the car. The implementation of cameras inside cars to record interactions between drivers and riders is something new. However, people are concerned about their privacy because this recording goes on during their trip duration, and they do not verbally consent to their recording. However, they consent to being in a person's car, hence they must abide to the driver's rules. There are federal rules about audio recordings, federal laws only requires "one party consent". *citation*

==== Government policies about recording ====
According to the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]], there are policies regarding recording audio conversations, including clarifications about the "one-party consent" rule that comes with it. Regarding audio conversations, it is illegal to record a conversation for which one is not partaking in. However, they are allowed to record if they are a member of the conversation themselves, without having to receive consent from the other party or having to let them know there is recording happening.

== Concerns ==
=== The potential abuse of location-tracking ===
There are several areas where data could potentially be abused by the application knowing the rider's location. Since trip data is collected, if the ride-sharing company has partnerships with corporations, their partners can use the data to predict future locations and be able to pinpoint an individual's interests and market towards them. *citation* Corporations can collect information on what types of stores and what brands are most often visited by a user and can build an online profile, which is traceable. This can also relate to advertising companies, which can target personal interests and alter their online interactions to start showing ads that are catered and specific towards where the user has visited. *citation*

There are some cases where bad implications could arise. If the user were to partake in something related to their political standpoints, companies can store this for later information and potentially use it against the user if they come into contact with the company in a professional setting. This can apply to medicinal, religious, or legal affiliations as well, that a user's location and places visited cannot be justified when being looked at from an outside perspective.

Relating more to the online profile created of the user, if a person solely relies on ride-sharing services to get around, one can track how long the user has been away from their home and how far away they are from their home. This becomes an opportunity for people to stalk or rob the user because they know when is the ideal time people aren't home. *citation* Looking on a broader scale, based on the demographics of the area a user interacts with, if they frequently visit the same stores within a certain area, information can be assumed, such as estimated income. *citation*

Users have the option to save a home or work address for easy access. Most often, users put their actual address, but in some cases, users have been known to put an address a couple streets away, just for their safety in case data gets leaked. However, while this is a very basic level of deflection, putting a home address a couple streets away still gives a general location of where the user is stationed.

=== Location aware applications ===
Individuals have concerns over how, what, when, and where their location information is being stored as well as to what extent others have access to it. Not only pertaining to ride-sharing applications, but any applications that have sharing enabled of sorts, there are several types of applications that are location aware. Location based searching (LBS) occurs when a user's tracking returns items and buildings around the user's current location in order to be tracked. A map is drawn with the orientation of the surrounding buildings to determine a location.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damiani|first=Maria L.|date=Oct 2014|title=Location privacy models in mobile applications: conceptual view and research directions|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562335430/219F4ADE8AD642F3PQ/18?accountid=14496|journal=GeoInformatica|volume=18|pages=819-842|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geo-location services are having the user tracked with an environmental footprint. It's an estimate of a user's location. Mobile sensing is the process of pinpointing the user's physical device, which has sensors and information that can be collected. Location sharing is a voluntary state where the user is in live-time and their location is constantly being updated and tracked.

=== Making use of user information ===
Looking more at the applications and how a user accesses the ride-sharing service, once a user inputs data into the app, it will be accessible on the web forever. Even if they delete information or delete their account, the information has been created on an online platform and now exists whether the user consents to it or not. These applications ask for user information such as phone number, email, and profile picture, all features which can be used to trace back to the user's identity. Once this information is in the application's database, it can accessed by the application as well as indirectly by any partners of the app.

Most apps have the payment charged and completed before a user can be connected to their ride. Users have the option to store credit card information for easy access instead of having to repeatedly input payment information. While there is an added level of security, such as passcode or touch ID before every transaction, this does not ensure the safety of this information in the app. It only ensures that the current transaction is made under the consent of the user.

=== Reverse image search ===
Users are allowed to input a profile picture into their applications. Doing so has the intention of helping drivers spot their intended riders. However, this can cause an issue because if somehow a rider's image is saved and uploaded to the web, connections can be made to personal accounts. For example, with Facebook's face recognition advanced algorithm, it is easier to identify people's identities from outside pictures.

== Targets ==
There are three main categories where location-based services should be protecting:

# Identity protection - Location-based services can put together an identity of a user, even with anonymous identification, through the frequency in locations.
# Location protection - Very straightforward, the user's true location should be protected. There is no absolute way for a person to completely hide their whereabouts.
# Behavior protection - The goal of this protection is to survey the mobile patterns from the user's behavior, what locations they attend that people can interpret their behavior and make judgments about their character.

== Solutions ==
=== Noise distribution ===
Researchers have come up with a conclusion which  introduces a solution for these issues which is a system that helps with both data privacy and user anonymity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The solution is a program that creates a noise distribution so a user’s certain location is offset. It is basically putting the location of the user through some encryption and reporting that location that only the system knows how to read, so it is not manipulating the actual location, but just how that data is input into the system. This solution has already been implemented into two major operating systems, [[MacOS|Mac OS]] and [[Linux]]. This solution helps with those who are suspicious of using these ride-sharing application softwares because of the fear of their privacy being invaded or potentially data being stolen, but this software has proven that it can handle securing data as well as keeping the user anonymous. It is more like an extra layer of security that creates another blanket to hide the user.

==== K-anonymity ====
K-anonymity serves as an Anonymizing Server, which is a trusted third party server which is in charge of providing anonymous cover for users. K-anonymity is used to preserve the location privacy by creating a location cloak without knowing the actual location of the user.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biswas|first=Pratima|last2=Sairam|first2=Ashok Singh|date=2018-07|title=Modeling privacy approaches for location based services|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/S1389128618301890/1-s2.0-S1389128618301890-main.pdf?_tid=b8168b74-0369-4335-a7fd-1332dea53f6a&amp;acdnat=1541790052_acfdd6566bb115cc20a85cdcf0a1cea8|journal=Computer Networks|volume=140|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2018.04.016|issn=1389-1286|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software attempts to find a number of users close to the actual users because then exact locations could not be correlated back to the original user in question and these several locations which cannot be identified to the users in close proximity would protect the original user. There is no way to distinguish between all the users.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Fuzzy interference systems ===
Another solution is to try and use fuzzy interference systems when relating to mobile geo-services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hashemi|first=Mahdi|last2=Malek|first2=Mohammad Reza|date=2012-07|title=Protecting location privacy in mobile geoservices using fuzzy inference systems|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971511001189|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|volume=36|issue=4|pages=311–320|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2011.12.002|issn=0198-9715}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution would use different details to identify the user that would not be prone to organizations abusing the obtained information. Currently, location based services can reveal several sensitive pieces of information, like closest religious institutions, which can reveal the identity of the user, which organizations utilize for purely commercial purposes. The paper proposes a solution, anonymization, which protects user’s data in case of accidental breaches. There is an explanation of the fuzzy inference system and how it works *explain how it works* and then the potential implication method in taxi drivers to see if this is an effective way of protecting people’s information because there isn’t a concrete design with anonymization that has proven to do well. There are different levels of precision that the location system can narrow down on a user. These systems turn quantitative data into qualitative data which would obscure a user’s identity and location. After a trial implementation with taxi drivers, several complications came up, mostly human misinterpretation, but in the future, investing more time into this solution and combining it with already existing solutions could provide a more effective solution. To those who are afraid of their locations being tracked and that being used to trace back to the user, this solution makes user data fuzzy so if they are being tracking, it is not completely precise. There are data tables that show experimental distances of how close a tracking software was to those who had implemented the fuzzy solution. This solution takes on a different approach because it doesn’t entirely solve the problem of how to entirely protect the user's privacy, but it is working towards it since the solution has not had enough time to mature, as it is just in introductory stages. It sheds light on the fact that the location tracking software is still not private even when solutions have been taken to try and overcome this solution but leaves an open ending because it ends that with more research and resources put into it (and specifically told what areas could be developed better) it could expand further and be developed better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Rui|last2=Yang|first2=Yupu|date=2013-06-19|title=Smooth support vector learning for fuzzy rule-based classification systems|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=551debe9-8331-46e6-985d-5b15447bf24d%40sessionmgr104|journal=Intelligent Data Analysis|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=679–695|doi=10.3233/ida-130600|issn=1571-4128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location transformation ===
One proposed solution is a model that would estimate how difficult it would be for outside sources to get their hands on someone’s private information. There are several mechanisms proposed that would be helpful in hiding data including location obfuscation, perturbation, confusion and suppression, and cryptographic techniques. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Location obfuscation ====
Obfuscating a user's location means to cloud the user's location. A user's location coordinates are still being preserved, however the accuracy is just being degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zurbarán|first=Mayra|last2=Wightman|first2=Pedro|last3=Brovelli|first3=Maria|last4=Oxoli|first4=Daniele|last5=Iliffe|first5=Mark|last6=Jimeno|first6=Miguel|last7=Salazar|first7=Augusto|date=2018-08-17|title=NRand-K: Minimizing the impact of location obfuscation in spatial analysis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12462|journal=Transactions in GIS|language=en|volume=22|issue=5|pages=1257–1274|doi=10.1111/tgis.12462|issn=1361-1682}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this cannot be a complete solution because this would just neglect the entire reason of location-based services. So being selective in what an application is obfuscating, would help with protection.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

There is a program, called NRand algorithm, which is the algorithm that determines the amount of obstruction that is put on the user location data. There are a couple issues that arise with this algorithm, including determining how much noise should be implemented and if the changing of the data is enough to alter it to an unrecognizable form from its original state. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=Jingyu|last2=Tong|first2=Wei|last3=Xu|first3=Fengyuan|last4=Zhong|first4=Sheng|date=2017|title=A Geo-Indistinguishable Location Perturbation Mechanism for Location-Based Services Supporting Frequent Queries|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8125751/?reload=true|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security|language=en-US|pages=1–1|doi=10.1109/tifs.2017.2779402|issn=1556-6013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Location perturbation ====
On a map, a location locks onto something in close proximity but not the exact user location because of added noise. With this added layer, if there is another location in a close enough range, a transition will be added to multiple locations and mask all points of interest. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Confusion and suppression ====
A dummy location is set as the true location. This is done so by pinpointing a user's specific location and transforming it into several other locations, yet keeping the true location. Suppression is a subset of these different applications where for a short period of time, when a user enters an area, the user information is temporarily suspended and the identity of the user is lost, so when they exit back out of the protected area, they have a new identity.  &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Cryptographic techniques ====
Original data is unable to be tracked because information goes through some sort of cryptographic interpreter, could be transformed into several different data points. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Rudeness''' (also called '''effrontery''') is a display of disrespect by not complying with the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[etiquette]] of a group or culture. These norms have been established as the essential [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] of normally [[acceptance|accepted]] behavior. To be unable or unwilling to align one's behavior with these norms known to the general population of what is socially acceptable is to be rude and are enforced as though they were a sort of social law, with social repercussions or rewards for violators or advocates, respectively. 

Rudeness, "constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium".{{sfn|Kasper|1990|p=208}}  Rudeness, particularly with respect to speech, is necessarily confrontational at its core.

Forms of rudeness include acting inconsiderate, insensitive, deliberately offensive, [[Politeness|impolite]], a faux pas, [[obscenity]], [[profanity]] and violating [[taboo]]s such as [[deviancy]]. In some cases, an act of rudeness can go so far as to be a [[crime]], for example, the crime of [[hate speech]].

==Relationship to morality==
Both [[manners]] and [[morality]] deal with whether a thing is morally good or bad, but  at different levels.  Unlike morality, which, for example, condemns [[murder]] as a violation of a person, manners primarily concerns itself with violations of human [[dignity]], rather than the person's health or property.{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=123}}  Rude behaviour is a violation of human dignity or of the respect due to others.

==Cultural differences==
{{Main|Intercultural competence}}

The specific actions that are considered polite or rude vary dramatically by place, time, and context.  Differences in [[social role]], [[gender]], [[social class]], [[religion]], and [[cultural identity]] may all affect the appropriateness of a given behaviour.  Consequently, a behaviour that is considered perfectly acceptable by one group of people may be considered clearly rude by another.  For example, in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], it was rude to indicate that a man wearing a [[mask]] in public could be recognized.{{sfn|Palleschi|2005}}  Instead, polite behaviour demanded that the masked person be treated as a completely unknown person and that no one ever attribute the masked person's actions to the individual who performed them.  By contrast, in the modern era, greeting a friend by name while he is wearing a mask, or talking to them later about their costume or activities, is not generally regarded as rude.

Cultural differences also appear over time.  In the mid-20th century, the meaning of [[eye rolling]] changed from its older signal of lust and passion to expressing contempt.{{sfn|Wickman|2013}}

==Utility==
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviours to achieve a goal.  Early works in [[linguistic pragmatism]] interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.

{{harvnb|Lakoff|1989}} addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  Rudeness in everyday speech "is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure".{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=154}}  Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions:  to vent negative feelings, and/or to get [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=159}}

== Examples ==
In every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies.  The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider ''rude'' or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances: 
&lt;!--

NOTE:  The goal is *NOT* to provide a comprehensive list of rude behaviours, or to create a "How to Be Rude" manual.

Please don't include items that are more accurately described as "unkind" (gossip) or "lazy" (not cutting the lawn often enough to suit the neighbours) or tautologies (things that are defined as rude, such as "rude gestures" or "rude words").

--&gt;

=== Speech ===
What constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered [[hate speech]] or inappropriate [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]] (such as using the word ''[[Hun#20th-century_use_in_reference_to_Germans|Hun]]'' to a [[German people|German]], using the word ''[[Jap]]'' to a [[Japanese people|Japanese person]], etc.). In most modern cultures, [[insult]]ing a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, following a particular religion, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing an individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.

However, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances.  A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.

Rude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as {{wikt-lang|en|shut up}} or using a [[tone of voice]] that indicates disrespect for the other person.  An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words.  A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.

Failing to speak can also be rude:  a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate [[gratitude|thanks]] for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver.  Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude.  Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.

=== Behaviours ===
Many behaviours can be rude.  These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.

This includes a failure to [[dress code|dress appropriately]] for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).  [[C. S. Lewis]] writes that "A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies"—but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}}

Rude behaviours often disturb other people, such as making [[noise]] or playing loud music.  An acceptable level of sound depends on the context:  yelling might be the only way to be heard at a noisy [[construction site]], and [[rock concert]]s are expected to feature loud music, but a conversation at a normal level, either by telephone or in person, might be rude in an environment where a reasonable degree of silence is expected, such as a [[library]], and complete silence is expected at other times, such as during religious ceremonies or performances of classical music.  This includes speaking over a presentation or film with no consideration for the other viewers.  Similarly, poor [[table manners]] can disturb or [[disgust]] nearby people, as can [[yawn]]ing, [[cough]]ing, [[fart]]ing or [[sneeze|sneezing]] without covering the mouth.

Other rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.  In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate [[social exclusion]] of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.  For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.  Similarly, [[cutting in line]] signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.  Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of [[personal space]] or [[Party crashing|crashing a party]], is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.

Other examples include:
*[[Bullying]] or [[intimidating]] people with the threat of violence
*[[Snob]]bery
*[[Aggressive driving]]

'''''Seances''''' is a 2016 interactive project by filmmaker and installation artist [[Guy Maddin]], co-creators Evan and Galen Johnson, and the [[National Film Board of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/press-room/press-releases-media-kits/?idpres=21002&lt;/ref&gt; combining Maddin's recreations of [[lost film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with an algorithmic film generator that allows for multiple storytelling permutations.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/seances-guy-maddins-film-generator-is-an-endless-cinematic-experience/article29825665/|title=Seances: Guy Maddin’s film generator is an endless cinematic experience|last=Green|first=Robert-Everett|date=2 May 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phi-centre.com/en/events/id/Seances|title=Seances Guy Maddin|date=2013|publisher=''PHI''|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddin began the project in 2012 in Paris, France, shooting footage for 18 films at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (this installation was titled ''Spiritismes'', the French word for “seances,” leading to press confusion about the project title)&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonathanball.com/guy-maddin-on-the-forbidden-room-and-writing-melodrama/|title=Guy Maddin on The Forbidden Room and Writing Melodrama |date=2014-12-05|last=ball|first=Jonathan|work=Dr. Jonathan Ball: Writing the Wrong Way (interview with Guy Maddin)|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued shooting footage for an additional 12 films at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"/&gt; The Paris and Montreal shoots each took three weeks, with Maddin completing one short film of approximately 15-20 minutes each day.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/97888-guy-maddin-on-the-saddest-music-in-the-world-and-his-interactive-seances/#.VxfCKPkrLq4|title=Guy Maddin on The Saddest Music in The World and His Interactive Seances (interview)|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|date=29 March 2016|work=Filmmaker Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoots were also presented as art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a “séance” during which Maddin "invite[d] the spirit of a lost photoplay to possess them."&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy"/&gt;

==Production history==

''Seances'' grew out of Maddin’s ''Hauntings'' project. Noah Cowan, a former director of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], told Maddin “he didn’t think it was possible to make art on the Internet,” which “reminded [Maddin] of what people said about cinema when it was starting out, when the moviolas and kinetoscopes were considered artless novelties.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin began with the idea of “shooting adaptations of lost films” and originally conceived the project as making “title-for-title remakes of specific lost films” but altered this plan in favour of producing original material as the project developed. Maddin completed 11 films to show as installation loops for Noah Cowan and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]’s Bell Lightbox theatre for this 2010 ''Hauntings'' project.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

At the [[SXSW]] 2012 festival, Maddin announced that he had begun production on the ''Seances'' project, for which he would shoot one hundred short films within a hundred-day span, at locations in Canada, France, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sxsw-12-interview-guy-maddin-talks-making-100-short-films-in-100-days-in-four-countries-with-current-project-spiritismes|title=SXSW '12 Interview: Guy Maddin Talks Making 100 Short Films In 100 Days In Four Countries With Current Project 'Spiritismes'|date=2012-03-16|work=Interview|publisher=''The Playlist''|accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maddin abandoned this approach to the project to focus more fully on original script creation, partnering with writers [[Evan Johnson]] and [[Robert Kotyk]], with additional writing by Maddin’s wife [[Kim Morgan]] and American poet [[John Ashbery]].&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin and Johnson also co-directed and shot, concurrently, a feature film titled ''[[The Forbidden Room (2015 film)|The Forbidden Room]]'', with the same writers. Although often misreported as the same project, ''The Forbidden Room'' “is a feature film with its own separate story and stars” while “''Seances'' will be an interactive Internet project.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt; Many of the actors in ''Seances'' also appear in ''The Forbidden Room''.

==Algorithmic storytelling==
Each viewer sees a unique film. Software designed by Halifax-based Nickel Media utilizes an [[algorithmic art|algorithm]] to create the narrative from scenes shot by Maddin, to form a 10- to 13-minute film, each with a unique title.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; The number of films ensures "hundreds of billions of unique permutations."&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Allan|title=Guy Maddin’s performance art installation Seances begins filming in Montreal|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2013/07/04/guy_maddins_performance_art_installation_seances_begins_filming_in_montreal.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan"&gt;Romney, Jonathan.

==Launch==
''Seances'' was launched on April 14, online and as part of [[Tribeca Film Festival]]’s Storyscapes program.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; 

==List of "resurrected" films==
In addition to reimagining lost films, Maddin is also "resurrecting" projects that were planned but never filmed. Maddin has stated that he will not be parodying or otherwise mimicking the approach of the directors whose films he is reenvisioning, but rather tried to capture the imagined "spirits of the films, rather than of their directors."&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan" /&gt; Films will not be shown in their entirety, but rather, offered as fragments in order to be recombined online.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25631">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[abstract algebra]], a '''semigroup with involution''' or a '''*-semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] equipped with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]], which&amp;mdash;roughly speaking&amp;mdash;brings it closer to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] because this involution, considered as [[unary operator]], exhibits certain fundamental properties of the operation of taking the inverse in a group: uniqueness, double application "cancelling itself out", and the same interaction law with the binary operation as in the case of the group inverse. It is thus not a surprise that any group is a semigroup with involution. However, there are significant natural examples of semigroups with involution that are not groups.

An example from [[linear algebra]] is the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] [[monoid]] of [[Real number|real]] square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order&amp;nbsp;''n'' (called the [[full linear monoid]]). The [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a matrix to its [[transpose]] is an involution because the transpose is well defined for any matrix and obeys the law {{nowrap|1=(''AB'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which has the same form of interaction with multiplication as taking inverses has in the [[general linear group]] (which is a subgroup of the full linear monoid). However, for an arbitrary matrix ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; does not equal the identity element (namely the [[diagonal matrix]]). Another example, coming from [[formal language]] theory, is the [[free semigroup]] generated by a [[nonempty set]] (an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]), with string [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the involution being the map which [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reverse]]s the [[linear order]] of the letters in a string. A third example, from basic [[set theory]], is the set of all [[binary relation]]s between a set and itself, with the involution being the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]].

Semigroups with involution appeared explicitly named in a 1953 paper of [[Viktor Wagner]] (in Russian) as result of his attempt to bridge the theory of semigroups with that of [[semiheap]]s.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let ''S'' be a [[semigroup]] with its binary operation written multiplicatively. An involution in ''S'' is a [[unary operation]] * on ''S'' (or, a transformation * : ''S'' → ''S'',  ''x'' ↦ ''x''*) satisfying the following conditions:
# For all ''x'' in ''S'', (''x''*)* = ''x''.
# For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'' we have (''xy'')* = ''y''*''x''*.

The semigroup ''S'' with the involution * is called a semigroup with involution.

Semigroups that satisfy only the first of these axioms belong to the larger class of [[U-semigroup]]s.

In some applications, the second of these axioms has been called [[antidistributive]].&lt;ref name="BrinkKahl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the natural philosophy of this axiom, [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]] remarked that it "becomes clear when we think of [x] and [y] as the operations of putting on our socks and shoes, respectively."&lt;ref&gt;H.S.M. Coxeter, ''Introduction to Geometry'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
# If ''S'' is a [[commutative]] semigroup then the [[identity function|identity map]] of S is an involution.
# If ''S'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] then the inversion map * : ''S'' → ''S''  defined by ''x''* = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;  is an involution. Furthermore, on an [[abelian group]] both this map and the one from the previous example are involutions satisfying the axioms of semigroup with involution.&lt;ref name="BergChristensen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. van den Berg|author2=J. P. R. Christensen|author3=P. Ressel|title=Harmonic Analysis on Semigroups: Theory of Positive Definite and Related Functions|year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-1128-0|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] then the inversion map is an involution which leaves the [[idempotent]]s [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. As noted in the previous example, the inversion map is not necessarily the only map with this property in an inverse semigroup. There may well be other involutions that leave all idempotents invariant; for example the identity map on a commutative regular, hence inverse, semigroup, in particular, an abelian group. A [[regular semigroup]] is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if it admits an involution under which each idempotent is an invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, Lemma 1&lt;/ref&gt;
# Underlying every [[C*-algebra]] is a *-semigroup. An important [[C*-algebra#Finite-dimensional C*-algebras|instance]] is the algebra ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') of ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''[[Complex number|C]]''', with the [[conjugate transpose]] as involution.
# {{anchor|ex5}} If ''X'' is a set, the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''X'' is a *-semigroup with the * given by the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]]. This is an example of a *-semigroup which is not a regular semigroup.
# {{anchor|ex6}} If X is a set, then the set of all finite sequences (or  [[String (computer science)|strings]]) of members of X forms a [[free monoid]] under the operation of concatenation of sequences, with sequence reversal as an involution.
# {{anchor|ex7}} A [[rectangular band]] on a Cartesian product of a set ''A'' with itself, i.e. with elements from ''A'' × ''A'', with the semigroup product defined as (''a'', ''b'')(''c'', ''d'') = (''a'', ''d''), with the involution being the order reversal of the elements of a pair (''a'', ''b'')* = (''b'', ''a''). This semigroup is also a [[regular semigroup]], as all bands are.&lt;ref name="Nordahl and Scheiblich"&gt;Nordahl and Scheiblich&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts and properties==
An element ''x'' of a semigroup with involution is sometimes called ''hermitian'' (by analogy with a [[Hermitian matrix]]) when it is left invariant by the involution, meaning ''x''* = ''x''. Elements of the form ''xx''* or ''x''*''x'' are always hermitian, and so are all powers of a hermitian element. As noted in the examples section,  a semigroup ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]] and admits an involution such that every idempotent is hermitian.&lt;ref&gt;Easdown, David, and W. D. Munn. "On semigroups with involution." Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 48.01 (1993): 93-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain basic concepts may be defined on *-semigroups in a way that parallels the notions stemming from a [[Regular semigroup|regular element in a semigroup]]. A ''partial isometry'' is an element ''s''  such that ''ss''*''s'' = ''s''; the set of partial isometries of a semigroup ''S'' is usually abbreviated PI(''S'').&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; A ''projection'' is an idempotent element ''e'' that is also hermitian, meaning that ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''e''* = ''e''. Every projection is a partial isometry, and for every partial isometry ''s'', ''s''*''s'' and ''ss''* are projections. If ''e'' and ''f'' are projections, then ''e'' = ''ef'' if and only if ''e'' = ''fe''.&lt;ref name="L117"&gt;Lawson, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial isometries can be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by ''s'' ≤ ''t'' defined as holding whenever ''s'' = ''ss''*''t'' and ''ss''* = ''ss''*''tt''*.&lt;ref name="L117"/&gt; Equivalently, ''s'' ≤ ''t'' if and only if  ''s'' = ''et'' and ''e'' = ''ett''* for some projection ''e''.&lt;ref name="L117"/&gt; In a *-semigroup, PI(''S'') is an [[ordered groupoid]] with the [[Partial groupoid|partial product]] given by ''s''&amp;sdot;''t'' = ''st'' if ''s''*''s'' = ''tt''*.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In terms of examples for these notions, in the *-semigroup of binary relations on a set, the partial isometries are the relations that are [[difunctional]]. The projections in this *-semigroup are the [[partial equivalence relation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.122 and p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[partial isometry|partial isometries]] in a C*-algebra are exactly those defined in this section. In the case of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') more can be said. If ''E'' and ''F'' are projections, then ''E'' ≤ ''F'' if and only if [[Image (mathematics)|im]]''E'' ⊆ im''F''. For any two projection, if ''E'' ∩ ''F'' = ''V'', then the unique projection ''J'' with image ''V'' and kernel the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''V'' is the meet of ''E'' and ''F''. Since projections form a meet-[[semilattice]], the partial isometries on ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') form an inverse semigroup with the product &lt;math&gt;A(A^*A\wedge BB^*)B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple example of these notions appears in the next section.

== Notions of regularity ==
There two related, but not identical notions of regularity in *-semigroups. They were introduced nearly simultaneously by Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich (1978) and respectively Drazin (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Crvenkovic and Dolinka&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regular *-semigroups (Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich) ===
As mentioned in the [[#Examples|previous examples]], [[inverse semigroup]]s are a subclass of *-semigroups. It is also textbook knowledge that an inverse semigroup can be characterized as a regular semigroup in which any two idempotents commute. In 1963, [[Boris M. Schein]] has published the following two axioms providing an analogous characterization of inverse semigroups as a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of *-semigroups:

* ''x'' = ''xx''*''x''
* (''xx''*)(''x''*''x'') = (''x''*''x'')(''xx''*)

The first of these looks like the definition of a regular element, but is actually in terms of the involution. Likewise, the second axiom appears to be describing the commutation of two idempotents. It is known however that regular semigroups do not form a variety because their class does not contain [[free object]]s (a result established by [[D. B. McAlister]] in 1968). This line of reasoning motivated Nordahl and Scheiblich to begin in 1977 the study of the (variety of) *-semigroups that satisfy only the first these two axioms; because of the similarity in form with the property defining regular semigroups, they named this variety regular *-semigroups.

It is a simple calculation to establish that a regular *-semigroup is also a regular semigroup because ''x''* turns out to be an inverse of ''x''. The rectangular band from [[#ex7|example 7]] is a regular *-semigroup that is not an inverse semigroup.&lt;ref name="Nordahl and Scheiblich"/&gt; It is also easy to verify that in a regular *-semigroup the product of any two projections is an idempotent.&lt;ref&gt;Nordahl and Scheiblich, Theorem 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; In the aforementioned rectangular band example, the projections are elements of the form (''x'', ''x'') and [like all elements of a band] are idempotent. However, two different projections in this band need not commute, nor is their product necessarily a projection since (''a'', ''a'')(''b'', ''b'') = (''a'', ''b'').

Semigroups that satisfy only ''x''** = ''x'' = ''xx''*''x'' (but not necessarily the antidistributivity of * over multiplication) have also been studied under the name of [[I-semigroup]]s.

====P-systems====
The problem of characterizing when a regular semigroup is a regular *-semigroup (in the sense of Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich) was addressed by M. Yamada (1982). He defined a '''P-system''' F(S) as subset of the idempotents of S, denoted as usual by E(S). Using the usual notation V(''a'') for the inverses of ''a'', F(S) needs to satisfy the following axioms:

# For any ''a'' in S, there exists a unique a° in V(''a'') such that ''aa''° and ''a''°''a'' are in F(S)
# For any ''a'' in S, and b in F(S), ''a°ba'' is in F(S), where ° is the well-defined operation from the previous axiom
# For any ''a'', ''b'' in F(S), ''ab'' is in E(S); note: not necessarily in F(S)

A regular semigroup S is a *-regular semigroup, as defined by Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich, if and only if it has a p-system F(S). In this case F(S) is the set of projections of S with respect to the operation ° defined by F(S). In an [[inverse semigroup]] the entire semilattice of idempotents is a p-system. Also, if a regular semigroup S has a p-system that is multiplicatively closed (i.e. subsemigroup), then S is an inverse semigroup. Thus, a p-system may be regarded as a generalization of the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup.

===*-regular semigroups (Drazin)===
{{anchor|Drazin}}
{{expand section|clarify motivation for studying these|date=April 2015}}
A semigroup ''S'' with an involution * is called a '''*-regular semigroup''' (in the sense of Drazin) if for every ''x'' in ''S'', ''x''* is ''H''-equivalent to some inverse of ''x'', where ''H'' is the [[Green's relations|Green’s relation]] ''H''. This defining property can be formulated in several equivalent ways. Another is to say that every [[Green's relations#The L.2C R.2C and J relations|''L''-class]] contains a projection. An axiomatic definition is the condition that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exists an  element ''x''′ such that {{nowrap|1=''x''′''xx′'' = ''x''′}}, {{nowrap|1=''xx''′''x'' = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=(''xx''′)* = ''xx''′}}, {{nowrap|1=(''x''′''x'')* = ''x''′''x''}}. [[Michael P. Drazin]] first proved that given ''x'', the element ''x′'' satisfying these axioms is unique. It is called the Moore&amp;ndash;Penrose inverse of ''x''. This agrees with the classical definition of the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]] of a square matrix.
In the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] semigroup ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') of square matrices of order ''n'', the map which assigns a matrix ''A'' to its [[Hermitian conjugate]] ''A''* is an involution. The semigroup ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') is a *-regular semigroup with this involution. The Moore–Penrose inverse of A in this *-regular semigroup is the classical Moore–Penrose inverse of ''A''.

==Free semigroup with involution ==
As with all varieties, the [[category theory|category]] of semigroups with involution admits [[free object]]s. The construction of a free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that of a [[free semigroup]] (and respectively that of a free monoid). Moreover, the construction of a [[free group]] can easily be derived by refining the construction of a free monoid with involution.&lt;ref name="L51"&gt;Lawson p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of a free semigroup with involution are the elements of the union of two ([[equinumerous]]) [[disjoint sets]] in [[Bijection|bijective correspondence]]: &lt;math&gt;Y=X\sqcup X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;. (Here the notation &lt;math&gt;\sqcup\,&lt;/math&gt; emphasized that the union is actually a [[disjoint union]].) In the case were the two sets are finite, their union ''Y'' is sometimes called an ''[[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] with involution''&lt;ref name="EhrenfeuchtHarju1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|author2=T. Harju|author3=Grzegorz Rozenberg|title=The Theory of 2-structures: A Framework for Decomposition and Transformation of Graphs|year=1999|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4042-4|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''symmetric alphabet''.&lt;ref name="Sakarovitch"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of Automata Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=305–306|author=Jacques Sakarovitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\theta:X\rightarrow X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; be a bijection; &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is naturally [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|extended]] to a bijection &lt;math&gt;{ }\dagger: Y \to Y&lt;/math&gt; essentially by taking the disjoint union of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (as a set) with its [[inverse function|inverse]], or in [[piecewise]] notation:&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Lipscomb|title=Symmetric Inverse Semigroups|year=1996|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-0627-2|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y^\dagger = 
\begin{cases}
  \theta(y) &amp; \text{if } y \in X \\
  \theta^{-1}(y) &amp; \text{if } y \in X^\dagger
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Now construct &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; as the [[free semigroup]] on &lt;math&gt;Y\,&lt;/math&gt; in the usual way with the binary (semigroup) operation on &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; being [[concatenation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;w = w_1w_2 \cdots w_k \in Y^+&lt;/math&gt; for some letters &lt;math&gt;w_i\in Y.&lt;/math&gt;

The bijection &lt;math&gt;\dagger&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is then extended as a bijection &lt;math&gt;{ }^\dagger:Y^+\rightarrow Y^+&lt;/math&gt; defined as the string reversal of the elements of &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; that consist of more than one letter:&lt;ref name="EhrenfeuchtHarju1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;w^\dagger=w_k^\dagger w_{k-1}^\dagger \cdots w_{2}^\dagger w_{1}^\dagger.&lt;/math&gt;

This map is an [[#Formal definition|involution]] on the semigroup &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the semigroup &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; with the map &lt;math&gt;{ }^\dagger\,&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup with involution, called a '''free semigroup with involution''' on ''X''.&lt;ref name="L172"&gt;Lawson p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; (The irrelevance of the concrete identity of &lt;math&gt;X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and of the bijection &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in this choice of terminology is explained below in terms of the universal property of the construction.) Note that unlike in [[#ex6|example 6]], the involution ''of every letter'' is a distinct element in an alphabet with involution, and consequently the same observation extends to a free semigroup with involution.

If in the above construction instead of &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; we use the [[free monoid]]  &lt;math&gt;Y^*=Y^+\cup\{\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is just the free semigroup extended with the [[empty word]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] &lt;math&gt;Y^*\,&lt;/math&gt;), and suitably extend the involution with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^\dagger = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;,
we obtain a '''free monoid with involution'''.&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"/&gt;

The construction above is actually the only way to extend a given map &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X^\dagger\,&lt;/math&gt;, to an involution on &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; (and likewise on &lt;math&gt;Y^*\,&lt;/math&gt;). The qualifier "free" for these constructions is justified in the usual sense that they are [[universal algebra|universal construction]]s. In the case of the free semigroup with involution, given an arbitrary semigroup with involution &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;\Phi:X\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;, then a [[semigroup homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\overline\Phi:(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \iota \circ \overline\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\iota : X \rightarrow (X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inclusion map]] and [[composition of functions]] is taken in [[Function composition#Alternative notations|diagram order]].&lt;ref name="L172"/&gt; The construction of &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; as a semigroup with involution is unique up to [[isomorphism]]. An analogous argument holds for the free monoid with involution in terms of [[monoid homomorphism]]s and the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the construction of &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^*&lt;/math&gt; as a monoid with involution.

The construction of a [[free group]] is not very far off from that of a free monoid with involution. The additional ingredient needed is to define a notion of [[reduced word]] and a [[rewriting]] rule for producing such words simply by deleting any adjacent pairs of letter of the form &lt;math&gt;xx^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x^\dagger x&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown than the order of rewriting (deleting) such pairs does not matter, i.e. any order of deletions produces the same result.&lt;ref name="L51"/&gt; (Otherwise put it, these rules define a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] rewriting system.) Equivalently, a free group is constructed from a free monoid with involution by taking the [[Quotient algebra|quotient]] of the latter by the [[Congruence relation|congruence]] &lt;math&gt;\{ (yy^\dagger, \varepsilon) : y\in Y\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is sometimes called the '''Dyck congruence'''&amp;mdash;in a certain sense it generalizes [[Dyck language]] to multiple kinds of "parentheses", however simplification in the Dyck congruence takes place regardless of order, e.g. if ")" is the inverse of "(", then &lt;math&gt;()=)(=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;; the one-sided congruence that appears in the Dyck language proper &lt;math&gt;\{ (xx^\dagger, \varepsilon) : x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt;, which instantiates only to &lt;math&gt;()=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is (perhaps confusingly) called the '''Shamir congruence'''. The quotient of a free monoid with involution by the Shamir congruence is not a group, but a monoid &lt;!--with involution?--&gt;; nevertheless it has been called the '''free half group''' by its first discoverer&amp;mdash;[[Eli Shamir]]&amp;mdash; although more recently it has been called the '''involutive monoid''' generated by ''X''.&lt;ref name="Sakarovitch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrosteKuich2009"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Manfred Droste, Werner Kuich, Heiko Vogler|title=Handbook of Weighted Automata|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01492-5|page=271|authors=Ion Petre and [[Arto Salomaa]]|chapter=Algebraic Systems and Pushdown Automata}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This latter choice of terminology conflicts however with the use of "involutive" to denote any semigroup with involution&amp;mdash; a practice also encountered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Neeb2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl-Hermann Neeb|title=Holomorphy and Convexity in Lie Theory|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015669-0|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Enrico G.

== Baer *-semigroups ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
A Baer *-semigroup is a *-semigroup with (two-sided) zero in which the right annihilator of every element coincides with the [[semigroup ideal|right ideal]] of some projection; this property is expressed formally as: for all ''x'' ∈ ''S'' there exists a projection ''e'' such that
: { ''y'' ∈ ''S'' | ''xy'' = 0 } = ''eS''.&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt;

The projection ''e'' is in fact uniquely determined by ''x''.&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt;

More recently, Baer *-semigroups have been also called '''Foulis semigroups''', after [[David James Foulis]] who studied them in depth.&lt;ref name="Blyth2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, John. “Daggers, Kernels, Baer *-Semigroups, and Orthomodularity.” ''Journal of Philosophical Logic''. April 6, 2013. {{doi|10.1007/s10992-013-9275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples and applications ===
The set of all binary relations on a set (from [[#ex5|example 5]]) is a Baer *-semigroup.&lt;ref name="Foulis63"&gt;Foulis, D. J. Relative inverses in Baer *-semigroups. Michigan Math. J. 10 (1963), no. 1, 65--84. {{doi|10.1307/mmj/1028998825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baer *-semigroups are also encountered in [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt; in particular as the multiplicative semigroups of [[Baer *-ring]]s.

If ''H'' is a [[Hilbert space]], then the multiplicative semigroup of all [[bounded operator]]s on ''H'' is a Baer *-semigroup. The involution in this case maps an operator to its [[adjoint operator|adjoint]].&lt;ref name="Foulis63"/&gt;

Baer *-semigroup allow the [[coordinatization]] of [[orthomodular lattice]]s.&lt;ref name="Blyth2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.S. Blyth|title=Lattices and Ordered Algebraic Structures|year=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84628-127-3|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apostle spoons six.jpg|thumb|A person only has a limited number of "spoons" that are consumed by activities throughout a day]]
The '''spoon theory''' is a [[disability]] [[metaphor]] and [[neologism]] used to explain the reduced amount of energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or [[chronic illness]]. Spoons are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. Each activity requires a given number of spoons, which will only be replaced as the person "recharges" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished.

This metaphor is used to describe the planning that many people have to do to conserve and [[rationing|ration]] their energy reserves to accomplish their activities of daily living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 June 2013 |title=Explaining Low Stamina Levels&amp;nbsp;– with Spoons |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-ouch-22972767 |work=BBC Online |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning and rationing of energy-consuming tasks has been described as being a major concern of those with chronic and fatigue-related diseases, illness, or conditions. The theory explains the difference between those who don't seem to have energy limits and those that do. The theory is used to facilitate discussions between those with limited energy reserves and those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Henderson |first=Wendy |date=29 June 2017 |title=Explaining Chronic Illness: An Alternative to the Spoon Theory |url=https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/06/29/explaining-chronic-illness-alternative-spoon-theory/ |website=Multiple Sclerosis News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miserandino&gt;{{cite web |last=Miserandino |first=Christine |year=2003 |title=The Spoon Theory |url=https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/ |website=But You Don't Look Sick |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because healthy people typically are not concerned with the energy expended during ordinary tasks such as bathing and getting dressed, the theory helps healthy people realize the amount of energy expended by chronically ill or disabled people to get through the day.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web |last=Band |first=Emily |date=24 September 2012 |title=How the Spoon Theory Helps Those Suffering Chronic Pain and Fatigue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/24/spoon-theory-chronic-pain-fatigue |website=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoons are widely discussed within autoimmune, disability, mental and other chronic illness online communities,{{sfnm |1a1=Alhaboby |1a2=Barnes |1a3=Evans |1a4=Short |1y=2017 |1p=6 |2a1=Alhaboby |2a2=Barnes |2a3=Evans |2a4=Short |2y=2018 |2p=177}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hess |first=Amanda |author-link=Amanda Hess |date=4 March 2016 |title=The Social Media Cure: How People with Chronic Illnesses Use Memes, Selfies, and Emojis to Soothe Their Suffering |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2016/03/how_spoonies_people_with_chronic_illnesses_use_memes_selfies_and_emojis.html |website=Slate |access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[emic]] descriptor.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Polledo|2016|p=5}} The term ''spoonie'' is sometimes used to refer to a person with a chronic illness that can be explained with the spoon theory.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;{{sfn|Gonzalez-Polledo|2016|p=5}}

== Origin ==
The term ''spoons'' was coined by Christine Miserandino in 2003 in her essay "The Spoon Theory".{{sfnm |1a1=Alhaboby |1a2=Barnes |1a3=Evans |1a4=Short |1y=2018 |1p=177 |2a1=Conrad |2y=2017 |2p=84}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Werber |first=Cassie |date=31 July 2017 |title=Spoons Have Become a Powerful Symbol of People's Invisible Pain |url=https://qz.com/1042347/what-is-the-spoon-theory-paris-jackson-and-macaulay-culkins-spoon-tattoos-are-a-powerful-symbol-of-invisible-pain/ |website=Quartz |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay describes a conversation between Miserandino and a friend.{{sfn|Alhaboby|Barnes|Evans|Short|2018|p=177}} The discussion was initiated by a question from the friend in which she asked about what having [[lupus]] feels like. The essay then describes the actions of Miserandino who took spoons from nearby tables to use as a [[visual aid]]. She handed her friend twelve spoons and asked her to describe the events of a typical day, taking a spoon away for each activity. In this way, she demonstrated that her spoons, or units of energy, must be [[rationing|rationed]] to avoid running out before the end of the day. Miserandino also asserted that it is possible to exceed one's daily limit, but that doing so means borrowing from the future and may result in not having enough spoons the next day. Miserandino suggested the spoon theory can describe the effects of mental illnesses as well.&lt;ref name=Miserandino/&gt;

== Special considerations ==
According to the spoon theory, spoons (units of energy) may be replaced after rest or a night of sleep. However, people with [[chronic diseases]], such as [[autoimmune disease]]s, and various [[disability|disabilities]] may have sleep difficulties. This can result in a particularly low supply of energy.{{sfn|Lashley|2003}} Some disabled people may not be fatigued by the disabilities themselves, but by the constant effort required to [[Passing (sociology)|pass]] as non-disabled.{{sfn|Brune|Wilson|2013}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

and many other fields.

==Mathematical formulation==

The object of a stimulus–response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation ''f'' between the stimulus ''x'' and the [[expected value]] (or other measure of location) of the response ''Y'':{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

: &lt;math&gt;E(Y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

A common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like

: &lt;math&gt;E(Y) = \alpha + \beta x.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Statistical theory]] for [[linear model]]s has been well developed for more than fifty years, and a standard form of analysis called [[linear regression]] has been developed.

'''The Moscow rules''' are [[Rule of thumb|rules-of-thumb]] said to have been developed during the [[Cold War]] to be used by spies and others working in Moscow.

The rules are associated with Moscow because the city developed a reputation as being a particularly harsh locale for clandestine operatives who were exposed. The list may never have existed as written.

== The rules ==
Agent [[Tony Mendez]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although no one had written them down, they were the precepts we all understood for conducting operations in the most difficult of operating environments: the Soviet capital. By the time they got to Moscow, everyone knew these rules. They were dead simple and full of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spy Dust: Two Masters of Disguise Reveal the Tools and Operations that Helped Win the Cold War|last=Mendez|first=Antonio|last2=Mendez|first2=Jonna|last3=Henderson|first3=Bruce|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2003|isbn=9780743434584|location=New York|page=36|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[International Spy Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Moscow Rules are given as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=The Spy Museum |url=https://www.spymuseum.org/exhibition-experiences/online-exhibits/argo-exposed/moscow-rules/ |title=Moscow Rules |access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Assume nothing. 
# Never go against your gut.
# Everyone is potentially under opposition control.
# Do not look back; you are never completely alone.
# Go with the flow, blend in.
# Vary your pattern and stay within your cover.
# Lull them into a sense of complacency.
# Do not harass the opposition.
# Pick the time and place for action.
# Keep your options open.

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Other rules which have been circulated around the Internet and used in fiction include:

* [[Murphy's Law|Murphy]] is right. (i.e., "What can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible moment.")
* Any operation can be aborted. If it feels wrong, it is wrong.
* Maintain a natural pace.
* Build in opportunity, but use it sparingly.
* Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. (Borrowed from [[Muhammad Ali]].)
* There is no limit to a human being's ability to rationalize the truth.
* Technology will always let you down.
* Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is an enemy action. (Taken from [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']])
* Do not attract attention, even by being overly careful.

Moscow rules are prominently referenced in [[John le Carré]]'s cold war books including ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]'' and ''[[Smiley's People]]'', as [[tradecraft]], including use of inconspicuous signal markers (drawing pins, chalk marks), the use of [[dead drop]]s, and the ways to signal the need for a (rare) face-to-face meeting. Moscow Rules are important at the beginning of ''Smiley's People,'' where the General invokes the rules to request a meeting with Smiley, but he is followed and killed by [[KGB]] assassins before it can happen.  The applicable rule states that no documents may be carried that cannot be instantly discarded, in this instance a 35mm negative concealed in an empty pack of cigarettes.

In ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' there are references to the Moscow Rules. In particular, in Season 6 Episode 10, [[Harry Pearce]] tells someone, "Treat London as enemy territory, keep your head down, find an opportunity, and make a move." In an earlier episode in Season 5, rogue MI6 agent Richard Dempsey is said to be in disguise and following the Moscow Rules, where the idea of treating the place as enemy territory is repeated.

In ''[[The Middleman (TV series)|The Middleman]]'', episode 8 (the "Ectoplasmic Pan-Hellenic Investigation"), the Moscow Rules are recited.

{{Taoism}}
The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:三|三]][[Wikt:寶|寶]]|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are basic [[virtues]] in [[Taoism]]. Although the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' originally used ''sanbao'' to mean "[[compassion]]", "[[frugality]]", and "[[humility]]", the term was later used to translate the [[Three Jewels]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) in [[Chinese Buddhism]], and to mean the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] ([[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]], [[qi]], and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]) in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].

==Tao Te Ching==
''Sanbao'' "three treasures" first occurs in ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' chapter 67, which [[Lin Yutang]] (1948:292) says contains [[Laozi]]'s "most beautiful teachings":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly. But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly. As for things that do not seem like folly — well, there can be no question about ''their'' smallness!&lt;br&gt;
Here are my three treasures. Guard and keep them! The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'. &lt;br&gt;
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; &lt;br&gt;
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. &lt;br&gt;
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things &lt;br&gt;
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. &lt;br&gt;
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving. Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed. (tr. Waley 1958:225)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arthur Waley]] describes these Three Treasures as, "The three rules that formed the practical, political side of the author's teaching (1) abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment, (2) absolute simplicity of living, (3) refusal to assert active authority."

===Chinese terminology===
The first of the Three Treasures is ''ci'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:慈|慈]]| p=''cí''|w=''tz'u''|l=compassion, tenderness, love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, benevolence}}), which is also a [[Classical Chinese]] term for "mother" (with "tender love, nurturing " semantic associations). ''Tao Te Ching'' chapters 18 and 19 parallel ''ci'' ("parental love") with ''xiao'' (孝 "filial love; filial piety"). [[Wing-tsit Chan]] (1963:219) believes "the first is the most important" of the Three Treasures, and compares ''ci'' with [[Confucianist]] ''ren'' (仁 "humaneness; benevolence"), which the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapters 5 and 38) mocks.

The second is ''jian'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:儉|儉]]|p=''jiǎn''|w=''chien''|l=frugality, moderation, economy, restraint, be sparing}}), a practice that the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapter 59) praises. Ellen M. Chen (1989:209) believes ''jian'' is "organically connected" with the Taoist metaphor ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' (樸 "uncarved wood; simplicity"), and "stands for the economy of nature that does not waste anything. When applied to the moral life it stands for the simplicity of desire."

The third treasure is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Chen notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] version of the ''Tao Te Ching'', this traditional "Three Treasures" chapter 67 is chapter 32, following the traditional last chapter (81, 31). Based upon this early silk manuscript, Robert G. Henricks (1989:160) concludes that "Chapters 67, 68, and 69 should be read together as a unit." Besides some graphic variants and [[phonetic loan character]]s, like ''ci'' (兹 "mat, this") for ''ci'' (慈 "compassion, love", clarified with the "heart radical" 心), the most significant difference with the received text is the addition of ''heng'' (恆, "constantly, always") with "I constantly have three …" (我恆有三) instead of "I have three …" (我有三).

===English translations===
The language of the ''Tao Te Ching'' is notoriously difficult to translate, as illustrated by the diverse English renditions of "Three Treasures" below.

A consensus translation of the Three Treasures could be: [[compassion]] or [[love]], [[frugality]] or [[simplicity]], and [[humility]] or [[modesty]].

==Other meanings==
In addition to these Taoist "Three Treasures", Chinese ''sanbao'' can also refer to the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] or the [[Three Jewels]] in [[Buddhism]]. [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:110) notes that Chinese Buddhists chose the Taoist term ''sanbao'' to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''[[triratna]]'' or ''ratnatraya'' ("three jewels"), and "It is not at all strange that the Taoists would take over this widespread ancient Indian expression and use it for their own purposes."

[[Erik Zürcher]], who studied influences of Buddhist doctrinal terms in Daoism, noted (1980:115) two later meanings of ''sanbao'': ''Dao'' 道 "the Way", ''jing'' 經 "the Scriptures", and ''shi'' 師 "the Master" seems to be patterned after Buddhist usage; ''Tianbao jun'' 天寶君 "Lord of Celestial Treasure", ''Lingbao jun'' 靈寶君 "Lord of Numinous Treasure", and ''Shenbao jun'' 神寶君 "Lord of Divine Treasure" are the ''Sanyuan'' 三元 "Three Primes" of the [[Lingbao School]].

'''Trait ascription bias''' is the tendency for people to view ''themselves'' as relatively variable in terms of [[personality]], behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations.&lt;ref name=kammer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kammer |first=D. |year=1982 |title=Differences in trait ascriptions to self and friend: Unconfounding intensity from variability |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=99–102 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1982.51.1.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is a tendency to describe one's own behaviour in terms of situational factors while preferring to describe another's behaviour by ascribing fixed dispositions to their personality. This may occur because peoples' own internal states are more readily observable and [[availability heuristic|available]] to them than those of others.

This [[attributional bias]] intuitively plays a role in the formation and maintenance of [[stereotype]]s and [[prejudice]], combined with the [[negativity effect]]. However, trait ascription and trait-based models of personality remain contentious in modern [[psychology]] and [[social science]] research. Trait ascription bias refers to the situational and dispositional evaluation and description of personality traits on a personal level. A similar bias on the group level is called the [[outgroup homogeneity bias]].

Trait ascription and the cognitive bias associated with it have been a topic of active research for more than three decades.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measuring Dispositional and Situational Attributions

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism is based either on the non-existence of personality traits (contrary to five factor descriptions), or suggest divergent interpretations of results and alternative mechanisms of ascription, limiting the scope of existing work.

==Evidence==
The empirical evidence supporting trait ascription and the psychological mechanisms underpinning it comes from a diverse body of research in [[psychology]] and the [[social sciences]].

===The actor and the observer===
Jones and Nisbett&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; were among the first to argue that people are biased in how they tend to ascribe traits and dispositions to others that they would not ascribe to themselves. Motivated by the classic example of the student explaining poor performance to a supervisor (in which the supervisor might superficially believe the student's explanations but really thinks the performance is due to "enduring qualities": lack of ability, laziness, ineptitude, etc.) their [[actor-observer asymmetry]] argument forms the basis of discourse&lt;ref name=kammer /&gt;&lt;ref name=funder /&gt;&lt;ref name=hampson&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trait Ascription and Depth of Acquaintance: The Preference for Traits in Personality Descriptions and Its Relation to Target Familiarity

|pages=398–411
|year=1983
|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(83)90068-5
|last1=Hampson
|first1=Sarah E
}}&lt;/ref&gt; on trait ascription bias.

===Kammer et al.===
In a 1982 study involving fifty-six undergraduate psychology students from the University of Bielefeld, Kammer et al.  demonstrated  that subjects rated their own variability on each of 20 trait terms to be considerably higher than their peers.&lt;ref name=kammer /&gt; Building on the earlier work of Jones and Nisbett,&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; which suggests people describe the behaviour of others in terms of fixed dispositions while viewing their own behaviour as the dynamic product of complex situational factors, Kammer hypothesized that one's own behaviours are judged to be less consistent (i.e. not as predictable) but of higher intensities (with regard to particular traits) than the behaviour of others. The experiment had each student describe themselves as well as a same-sex friend using two identical lists of trait-descriptive terms. For example, for the trait of dominance the student was first asked "In general, how dominant are you?" and then "How much do you vary from one situation to another in how dominant you are?"&lt;ref name=kammer /&gt; Kammer's results strongly supported his hypothesis.

===The "trait" of ascribing traits===
David C. Funder's work&lt;ref name=funder /&gt; on the "trait" of ascribing personality traits investigates the psychology of individuals who tend not to grant others the variability (i.e. lack of predictability) they grant themselves, instead preferring to ascribe traits and infer dispositional explanations of behaviour.  It had been generally established&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; that people ascribe more traits to others than to themselves, known as the [[actor-observer asymmetry]] in attribution,&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; but Funder's hypthothesis was that some individuals are more inclined to make dispositional trait attributions than others, regardless of who they are describing.&lt;ref name=funder /&gt; In the experiment, sixty-three undergraduates filled out a series of questionnaires which asked them to describe themselves, their best friend, and an acquaintance. For each of twenty pairs of polar opposite trait terms (e.g. "friendly—unfriendly") subjects either ranked the person on a discrete scale or chose "depends on the situation", allowing the subject to "not make a dispositional ascription."&lt;ref name=funder /&gt; Based on third-party Q-Sort personality descriptions of the subjects, certain negative personality traits were correlated with those subjects who tended to ascribe dispositions to others, while traits such as "charming", "interesting", and "sympathetic" were associated&lt;ref name=gaertner&gt;{{cite journal |title=Associations and Ascriptions of Positive and Negative Characteristics 
|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly 
|pages=23–30 
|year=1983

 |volume=46|jstor=3033657 
|last1=Gaertner 
|first1=Samuel L. 
|last2=McLaughlin 
|first2=John P. 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with those who preferred not to ascribe traits. This result is consistent with the type of personality commonly associated with promoting [[stereotypes]] and [[prejudice]].

==Theoretical basis==
While trait ascription bias has been described by empirical results from various disciplines, most notably [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]], explaining the mechanism of the bias remains a contentious issue in the theory of personality description literature.&lt;ref name=costa /&gt;&lt;ref name=block&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contrarian View of the Five-Factor Approach to Personality Description

Attribution plays a role in how people understand and judge the causes of the behaviour of others,&lt;ref name=solomon /&gt; which in turn affects how they ascribe traits to others. ''Attributional'' theory&lt;ref name=kelley&gt;{{cite journal |title=Attribution Theory and Research

===Big Five personality traits===
{{main article|Big Five personality traits}}

The big five personality traits (or five factor model) arguably&lt;ref name=costa /&gt;&lt;ref name=block /&gt; provides a robust set of traits by which personalities can be accurately described. It supports the notion that there are cross-cultural, enduring traits which manifest in behaviour and can, if correctly ascribed to individuals, provide an actor with predictive power over an observer.

==Mitigation==
Trait ascription bias, regardless of the theoretical mechanisms underpinning it, intuitively plays a role in various social phenomenon observed in the wild. [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]], attitudes of [[prejudice]] and the [[negativity effect]], among others, involve ascribing dispositions (traits) to other people on the basis of little information, no information or simply "gut instincts", which amounts to trait ascription bias. As such, some researchers&lt;ref name=ariely&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ariely|first1=Dan|title=Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions|date=2009|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=9780007319923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kApgNtTsAccC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are interested in [[cognitive bias mitigation|mitigating cognitive biases]] to reduce their effects on society.

==Criticism==
Trait ascription bias has received criticism on a number of fronts.&lt;ref name=turner /&gt;&lt;ref name=block /&gt; In particular, some have argued that trait ascription, and the notion of traits, are merely artefacts of methodology and that results contrary to conventional wisdom can be achieved with simple changes to the experimental designs used.&lt;ref name=kammer /&gt;&lt;ref name=funder /&gt;&lt;ref name=block /&gt; Furthermore, the theoretical bases for trait ascription bias are criticized&lt;ref name=block /&gt; for failing to recognize constraints and "questionable conceptual" assumptions.

[[File:George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.jpg|thumb|[[George Lusk]], President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.]]
The '''Whitechapel Vigilance Committee''' was a group of local volunteers who patrolled the streets of London's [[Whitechapel District (Metropolis)|Whitechapel District]] during the period of the [[Whitechapel murders]] of 1888. The volunteers patrolled mainly at night in the search of the murderer. The committee was set up by local businessmen who were concerned that the killings were affecting commerce in the area. It was led by [[George Lusk]], a local builder who was elected chairman during the committee's first meeting on 10 September 1888.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/timeline.html | title=Jack the Ripper Timeline |publisher=[[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other committee members included Publican Joseph Aarons (treasurer), Mr. B. Harris (secretary),&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;Eddleston, John J. 'Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia' Published by ABC-CLIO (2001) pg 139 {{ISBN|1-57607-414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Messrs. Barnett, Cohen, H. A. Harris, Hodgkins, Houghton, Isaacs, Jacobs, Laughton, Lindsay, Lord, Mitchell, Reeves, and Rogers. The ''Daily Telegraph'' reported on 5 October 1888 that the leading members of the committee were "drawn principally from the trading class, and include a builder, a cigar-manufacturer, a tailor, a picture-frame maker, a licensed victualler, and 'an actor.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]] 5 October 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was probably the entertainer Charles Reeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/notable_people/charles-reeves.html|title=Charles Reeves|publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=January 2017}}

As chairman of the committee, Lusk's name appeared in the national newspapers and on posters in Whitechapel appealing for information concerning the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]] and complaining about the lack of a reward for such information from the government. Due to this publicity, Lusk received threatening letters through the post, allegedly from the murderer. Lusk is also mentioned in a letter dated 17 September 1888, reportedly discovered among archive materials in the late 20th century; however, most experts dismiss this as a modern hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ |title=Ripper Letters |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:vigilancecommittee.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Members of the Vigilance Committee examine the contents of the box sent to Lusk&lt;/center&gt;]]
On 30 September 1888 the committee members wrote to the government under [[Lord Salisbury]] in an attempt to persuade them to offer a reward for information leading to the apprehension of the killer. When the [[Home Secretary]] [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]] refused, the committee offered its own reward.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; The committee also employed two private detectives, Mr. Le Grand (or Grand) and Mr. J. H. Batchelor,&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; to investigate the murders without the involvement of the local police.

The committee was unhappy with the level of protection that the community was receiving from the [[Metropolitan Police|police]], so it introduced its own system of local patrols, using hand-picked unemployed men to patrol the streets of the East End every evening from midnight to between four and five the next morning. Each of these men received a small wage from the Committee, and patrolled a particular beat, being armed with a [[police whistle]], a pair of [[galoshes]] and a strong stick. The committee itself met each evening at nine in The Crown, and once the public house closed at 12.30&amp;nbsp;am the committee members would inspect and join the patrols. These patrols were shortly to be joined by those of the Working Men's Vigilance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden Philip 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' Robinson, London (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]], which was sent with half of a human kidney, was posted to the committee's chairman George Lusk, who received it on 16 October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/west_ham_guardian/881020.html |title=The East London Horrors.

{{nihongo|'''''Yamato-damashii'''''|大和魂||"Japanese spirit"}} or {{nihongo|'''''Yamato-gokoro'''''|大和心||"Japanese heart/mind"}} is a [[Japanese language]] term that refers to the cultural values and characteristics of the [[Japanese people]]. The phrase was coined in the [[Heian period]] to describe the indigenous Japanese 'spirit' or cultural values as opposed to cultural values of foreign nations such as those identified through contact with [[Tang dynasty]] [[China]].  Later, a qualitative contrast between Japanese and Chinese spirit was elicited from the term. [[Edo period]] writers and [[samurai]] used it to augment and support the [[Bushido]] concept of honor and valor.  [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] propagandized ''Yamato-damashii''&amp;nbsp;– "the brave, daring, and indomitable spirit of Japanese people"&amp;nbsp;– as one of the key [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese military-political doctrines in the Shōwa period]]. English translations of ''Yamato-damashii'' include the "Japanese spirit", "Japanese soul", "Yamato spirit", and "The Soul of Old Japan". [[Lafcadio Hearn]] mentions the latter in connection with [[Shinto]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;For this national type of moral character was invented the name ''Yamato-damashi'' (or ''Yamato-gokoro''),&amp;nbsp;— the Soul of Yamato (or Heart of Yamato),&amp;nbsp;— the appellation of the old province of Yamato, seat of the early emperors, being figuratively used for the entire country. We might correctly, though less literally, interpret the expression ''Yamato-damashi'' as "The Soul of Old Japan". (1904:177)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin of the term==
Originally ''Yamato-damashi'' did not bear the bellicose weight or ideological timbre that it later assumed in pre-war modern Japan. It first occurs in the {{nihongo|''Otome''|乙女|}} section of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (Chapter 21), as a native virtue that flourishes best, not as a contrast to foreign civilization but, rather precisely, when it is grounded on a solid basis in Chinese learning. Thus we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, the safe thing is to give him a good, solid fund of knowledge. It is when there is a fund of Chinese learning (''zae'' 才)  that the Japanese spirit (''yamato-damashii'' 大和魂) is respected in the world. ([[Murasaki Shikibu]], ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' tr. [[Edward Seidensticker]], 1976, 1:362) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lexicology==
''Yamato-damashii'' "Japan, Japanese" [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''Yamato'' ([[Wikt:大和|大和]], "great harmony") with ''damashii'', which is the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ''[[rendaku]]'' pronunciation of ''tamashii'' ([[Wikt:魂|魂]] "spirit; soul"). Both these ''[[kanji]]'' ([[Chinese characters]] used in Japan) readings ''Yamato'' (大和) and ''damashii'' (魂) are native Japanese ''[[kun'yomi]]'', while the ''Wakon'' (和魂 "Japanese spirit") reading is Sinitic ''[[on'yomi]]'' borrowed from Chinese ''Héhún'' (和魂).

''Yamato'' is historically the second of three common Japanese [[endonym]]s (or autonyms) for 'Japan; Japanese'.
*''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' ([[Wikt:倭|倭]] or [[Wikt:和|和]]) is Japan's oldest endonym and derives from the  [[Han dynasty]] Chinese exonym ''Wō'' 倭 "Japan, Japanese". This character 倭, which graphically combines the [[Wikt:亻|亻]] "human, person" [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] and a ''wěi'' [[Wikt:委|委]] "bend" [[phonetic]], was usually pronounced ''wēi'' in [[Classical Chinese]] compounds like ''wēichí'' 倭遲 "winding, circuitous", but scholars have interpreted ''Wō'' 倭 "Japanese" as connoting either "submissive; docile" or "short; dwarf". In the 8th century, Japanese scribes replaced the [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative Chinese character]]  倭 for ''Wa'' "Japan" with ''Wa'' 和 "harmony; peace".
*''Yamato'' (大和, "great harmony") is the oldest native name for "Japan". ''Daiwa'' and ''Taiwa'' (borrowed from Chinese ''dàhé'' 大和) are ''on'yomi'' readings. This name ''Yamato'' (大和) originally referred to "[[Yamato Province]]", around present-day [[Nara Prefecture]], where [[Emperor Jimmu]] legendarily founded Japan. Common words with this [[prefix]] include ''Yamato-jidai'' (大和時代 "[[Yamato period]]", 250-710 CE), ''Yamato-minzoku'' (大和民族 "[[Yamato people]]; Japanese race"), and ''[[Yamato-e]]'' (大和絵 "traditional Japanese-style paintings").
*''Nihon'' or ''Nippon'' ([[Wikt:日本|日本]], "sun's origin"; "[[Japan]]") is the normal modern [[endonym]]. Compared with the neutral pronunciation ''Nihon'', ''[[Names of Japan|Nippon]]'' has more nationalistic connotations. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
In current Japanese usage, ''Wa'' 倭 is an archaic [[variant Chinese character]] for ''Wa'' 和, ''Yamato'' is a literary and historical term, and ''Nihon'' is the usual name for "Japan; Japanese".

''Tamashii'' or ''tama'' (魂 "soul; spirit; ghost" or 霊 "spirit; soul") is Japanese ''kun'yomi'', while ''kon'' or ''gon'' is Chinese ''on'yomi'' (from ''hún'' [[Hun and po|魂]]). The [[Shinto]]-influenced semantics of Japanese ''tama''/''tamashii'' exceed customary English concepts of "spirit", "soul", or "ghost", besides the human soul, it also includes diverse spiritual forces found in nature. [[Roy Andrew Miller]] suggests that German ''[[Geist]]'' or French ''[[Wikt:élan|élan]]'' are better translations than English ''spirit'' or ''soul'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But finally we must conclude that nothing in any commonly used European language, including English, really does justice to Japanese ''tama''. The spirit, soul, ''Geist'', or ''élan'' to which the Japanese term has reference, whether it is the ''tama'' of ''Yamato-damashii'' or the ''tama'' of ''kotodama'', is a vital and active entity that plays no part in any usual Western-language imagery or expression. We have no such word, and we make use of no imagery capitalizing upon the concepts that it employs; but the Japanese have, and they do. (1982:131) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Kotodama]]'' ({{lang|ja|言霊}}, "word spirit", approximately "[[magic word]]") illustrate this traditional Japanese belief about ''tama(shii)'' energies. ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' (5th ed., 2003) gives ''kotodama'' translation [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]] and a revealing usage example: "{{lang|ja|ことだま【言霊】}}, the soul [spirit] of language; the miraculous power of language [a phrase, a spell]. ̍ ⇨ {{lang|ja|言霊の幸(さきわ)う国}} Japan, "the land where the mysterious workings of language bring bliss"."

''[[Yamato nadeshiko]]'' ({{lang|ja|大和撫子}}, "Japanese [[fringed pink]]") is a floral metaphor for "the idealized traditional Japanese woman". During World War II, ultra-nationalists popularized ''Yamato-nadeshiko'' as the female manifestation of ''Yamato-damashii''.

== Later history==
The record of ''Yamato-damashii'' dates back one millennium to the Heian period (794–1185) of Japanese history, when [[Chinese culture]] and [[Chinese language]] were highly influential.

''Yamato-gokoro'' (大和心 "Japanese heart; Japanese mind" is the closest synonym of ''Yamato-damashii''. The Heian poet [[Akazome Emon]] first used ''Yamato-gokoro'' in her ''Goshūi Wakashū'' (後拾遺和歌集 "Later Collection of [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] Gleanings," 1086).

Since ''Wa'' 和 commonly abbreviates ''Yamato'' 大和 "Japan; Japanese", 和魂 (also read ''Wakon'') is a contraction of ''Yamato-damashii''. The ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'' (circa 1120) first uses it describing a burglar who murdered a nattering scholar of Chinese classical law. "Although Kiyohara no Yoshizumi (清原善澄) had admirable learning, he is said to have died in this childish way because he did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit" (tr. Carr 1994:283).

For centuries after its use by Heian authors ''Yamato-damashii'' was rarely recorded until the late [[Edo period]] (1600–1868). One [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] exception is the ''[[Gukanshō]]'' history (ca. 1220), which uses ''Yamato-damashii'' (和魂) in praising the character of child [[Emperor Toba]] (r. 1107–1123).
&lt;blockquote&gt; Still, he had the personality of (his uncle) Fujiwara no Kinzane (藤原公実) characterized by Chinese learning and followed in the footsteps of (his ancestor) [[Sugawara no Michizane]], but Toba had even more Japanese spirit than either of them. (adapted from Carr 1994:283)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three new "Japanese spirit" phrases originated around the 1867 [[Meiji Restoration]]. First, the modernization {{nihongo|''Nihon-damashii''|日本魂|}} was fashioned by [[Kyokutei Bakin]], a famous [[samurai]] author of ''[[Gesaku]]''. His ''Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki'' ("The Crescent Moon", 1811) quotes [[Minamoto no Tametomo]] discussing ''[[seppuku]]'' rituals: "I admit that a person who does not care about dying when on the verge of death may superficially have the Japanese spirit, but I think this is a misunderstanding from not having learned about it." (tr. Carr 1994:284). Second, ''Wakon-kansai'' (和魂漢才 "Japanese spirit and Chinese scholarship") occurs in the ''Kanke ikai'' (菅家遺戒 "Sugawara's dying instructions"). Third, ''Wakon-yōsai'' (和魂洋才 "Japanese spirit and Western techniques") was created by Yoshikawa Tadayasu (吉川忠安) in his ''Kaika sakuron'' (開化策論 , "Questions and Themes on Progress", 1867).

Following the Japanese victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]], nationalists made ''Wakon-yōsai'' into a catchphrase for [[modernization]] and [[militarization]], and developed ''Yamato-damashii'' into what Miller (1982:13) calls "the official rallying cry for the Japanese armed forces in [[World War II]]."

In the present day, ''Yamato-damashii'' is historically associated with [[Japanese nationalism]], but is commonly used in ''[[Nihonjinron]]'' discussions and sports media. It is the motto for the international Purebred [[mixed martial arts]] school headed by Japanese-American [[Enson Inoue]]. Professor David Pollack predicts that ''Yamato-damashii'' will become extinct.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synthesis comes to an end only when antithesis ceases to appear. For many centuries Japan found its most significant antithesis in China. During the last century and a half the West has been the antithetical term in the dialectic, and as always it has been in that "other" that Japan has sought its own image, peering anxiously for signs of its own identity into the mirror of the rest of the world. After the challenge of Western technology has been successfully met, one wonders what will be left that is "alien," besides the very fact that the historically necessary "other" is lacking. In that case, "Japanese spirit" (Yamato-damashii) will find itself face to face with the most frightening "other" of all – its lack – at which point opposition must cease or else feed upon itself. (1986:52-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definitions==
Racially and ethnically offensive words are problematic for dictionaries. [[Lexicographer]]s and publishers have editorial policies for treating [[ethnic slurs]] and insults. For example, [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] (4th ed., 2000) defines ''Jap'' as "''Offensive Slang''. Used as a disparaging term for a person of Japanese birth or descent."

Michael Carr argues that ''Yamato-damashii'' (1994:280-1) "significantly differs from everyday racist slurs because it is not an overt insult, it is the opposite: an ethnic adulation. It belongs to a special category of benedictions such as ''[[Manifest Destiny]]'' or ''[[Chosen People]]'' that imply national, racial, or ethnic self-conceit." The nationalist and racist connotations of Japanese ''Yamato-damashii'' are comparable with German ''Herrenvolk'' ("[[Master race]]").

Carr lexicographically analyzed ''Yamato-damashii'' definitions among modern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] from four publishers, namely, ''[[Daijisen]]'' (Shōgakukan, 1986), ''[[Daijirin]]'' (Sanseidō, 1988), ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (Kōdansha, 1989), and ''[[Kōjien]]'' (Iwanami, 1991).

For instance, this definition from the popular ''Daijirin'' dictionary gives the ''kanji'' 大和魂, modern and [[Old Japanese]] pronunciations, two meanings, synonyms, and usage examples from [[Japanese literature]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;やまとだましい［―だましひ］4 【《大和》魂】①大和心。和魂。（漢学を学んで得た知識に対して）日本人固有の実務・世事などを処理する能力・知恵をいう。「才(ざえ)を本としてこそ、―の世に用ゐらるる方も強う侍らめ〔出典： 源氏（乙女）〕」 「露、―無かりける者にて〔出典： 今昔 二十〕」②( 近世以降の国粋思想の中で用いられた語)日本民族固有の精神。日本人としての意識。&lt;br&gt;
'''yamato''' ... '''-damashii''', ''-damashiFi'' "type 4" [accent on ''da''] 【《大和》魂】1. ''yamato-gokoro''. ''wakon''. (in contrast to knowledge obtained from studying Chinese classics) Japanese people's characteristic ability or wisdom/intelligence for managing/treating actual things and worldly affairs. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (The Maiden [chapter]) "Without a solid foundation of book-learning this 'Japanese spirit' of which one hears so much is not of any great use in the world." [Tales of] Times Now Past (20) "He did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit." 2. (term used in ultra-nationalistic ideology of recent times) characteristic mentality of the Japanese race/people. Consciousness/awareness of being a Japanese person. (tr. Carr 1994:288)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Collectively, these four definitions provide insights into what ''Yamato-damashii'' means in current Japanese usage. They all distinguish two basic meanings: ① "A Japanese practical ability; opposed to Chinese scholarship" and ② "A traditional (bushido/nationalistic) concept of death-defying valor".  When two or more definitions use identical terminology, it suggests consensus on semantics. For instance, while the dictionaries split on whether meaning ① refers to ''Nihon-minzoku'' (日本民族 "Japanese race/people/nation") or ''Nihon-jin'' (日本人 "Japanese person/people"), all four say the nationalistic meaning ② refers to ''Nihon-minzoku''.

For meaning ①, the most salient word (used 7 times) is ''koyū'' (固有 "inherent; innate; characteristic; special quality"). This sense is defined as a ''noryoku'' (能力 "ability, capability; competency") or ''chie'' (知恵 "wisdom; insight; intelligence"), which pertains to ''jisseikatsujōno'' (実生活上 "real life; everyday/practical reality') or ''jitsumutekina'' (実務的な "actual things, practical experience").

For meaning ②, all the definitions describe a ''seishin'' (精神 "mind; mentality; spirit; soul; genius"). Specifically a "Japanese spirit" with ''kakan'' (果敢 "boldness; courage; daring; determination"), ''yūmō'' (勇猛 "bravery; valor; intrepidness; daring"), and ''shinmei o mo oshimanai'' (身命をも惜しまない "without regard for one's life"), especially when ''koto ni atatte'' (事に当たって "facing a vital matter; in case of crisis"). Purity is mentioned with ''seijo'' (清浄 "purity; cleanliness") and ''isagiyoi'' (潔い "pure; clean; honorable; gallant; brave").

Within this dictionary sample, only the ''Nihongo daijiten'' qualifies ''Yamato-damashii'' as a characteristic that is ''to sareta'' (とされた "assumed, supposed; alleged'"), whereas the other three define it as a matter of fact. Carr concludes (1994:290), "Believing that all individuals of any race or nationality share certain "spiritual" characteristics is at best overgeneralization, or at worst racism."

Some monolingual English dictionaries enter ''Yamato'' or ''Yamato-e'', but only the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] enters ''Yamato-damashii''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yamato''' (ja'mato) [Jap., = 'Japan']&lt;br&gt;
'''1'''. The style or school of art in Japan which culminated in the 12th and 13th centuries and dealt with Japanese subjects in a distinctively Japanese (rather than Chinese) way. Usu. as '''Yamato-e''' ('''†-we''') [''e'' picture]; also –'''ryū''' [-''ryū'' style, orig. stream, school]. … &lt;br&gt;
'''2'''. '''Yamato-damashii''': the Japanese spirit. … (v. 3, 2002) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''OED'' gives three usage examples, starting with ''Yamato-damashi'' (1942, ''Royal Air Force Journal'', "He will be filled with what is called ''yamato damashi'' [sic] or the pure spirit of Japan.") and ''Yamato-damashii'' (1957, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''). Note that the 1904 Hearn quotation above antedates this 1942 citation.

Most Japanese-English dictionaries literally translate ''Yamato-damashii'' as "the Japanese spirit". For instance, [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]] (5th ed., 2003) enters ''Yamato'' "'''やまと'''【大和】 Yamato; (old) Japan" along with 14 subentries, including ''Yamato-damashii'' "'''大和魂''' the Japanese spirit" and ''Yamato-gokoro'' "'''大和心''' the Japanese spirit; the Japanese sensibility."

The online ''Encyclopedia of Shinto'' (linked below, note the pronunciation file) comprehensively defines '''Yamato-damashii'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Literally, "Japanese spirit"; ''Yamato damashii'' is also written 大和魂. This term is often contrasted with "Chinese Learning" (''karasae''), that is, knowledge and scholarship imported into Japan from China. ''Yamato damashii'' refers to an inherent faculty of common-sense wisdom, resourcefulness, and prudent judgment that is characteristic of, and unique to, the Japanese people. It also refers to a practical, "real life" ability and intelligence that is in contrast with scholarship and knowledge acquired through formal education. It is a term used to express such ideas as the essential purity and resolute spirit of the Japanese people, the wish for the peace and security of the nation, and the possession of a strong spirit and emotion that will meet any challenge, even at the expense of one's own life. ''Yamato damashii'' is synonymous with ''Yamato gokoro'' (lit. "Japanese heart"). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
