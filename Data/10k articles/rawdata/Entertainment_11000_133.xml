'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">'''Air sex''' is a performance activity invented in [[Japan]]; clothed men and women simulate [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with an invisible partner, often in an exaggerated manner, set to music, and in a competition before an audience. This is somewhat akin to playing [[air guitar]], explaining the name. The creator, ''J-Taro Sugisaku'', says that it was invented in [[Tokyo]] in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. 

A report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine ''Weekly Playboy'' in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site ''[[Mainichi Shimbun|Mainichi Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/09/20060921p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan's air sex world champion licks himself into shape]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mainichi Daily News, 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the air sex "world championship" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

''Japanorama'', Series 3, Episode 2, BBC3, first aired 26 March 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as "inappropriate for some users".

These videos led to coverage in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Air_Sex Air Sex links], by Buzzfeed
&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Japanorama'' video was shown in May 2007 at the [[JACON|JACON 2007]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2FlHwu6EM Air Sex Contest Jacon '07]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves "Peer Pressure" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name "amp6". [[Fleshbot]] called these "The Best Air Sex Video of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;"Peer Pressure" performed their routine in Atlanta as part of the official Air Sex World Championships tour in June 2009.

'''''Banjo-Tooie''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. It was first released on 20 November 2000&lt;ref name="Release date"/&gt; in North America and on 12 April 2001 in Europe, and later re-released as an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game for the [[Xbox 360]] on 29 April 2009. It is the second instalment in the [[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|''Banjo-Kazooie'' series]] and serves as a sequel to the original ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''. The story of the game follows series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of antagonist Gruntilda and her two sisters from vapourising the inhabitants of the game's world.

Development of the game started in June 1998, directly after the release of its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. ''Banjo-Tooie'' features [[level (video gaming)|levels]] that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving [[puzzle video game|puzzles]], collecting items, and defeating [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. It also includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' video game compilation, released for the [[Xbox One]] in 2015.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Banjo-Tooie gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of Spiral Mountain, the starter world in the game. It is used to access the hub world and other parts of the game.]]
Similar to its predecessor ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''Banjo-Tooie'' features three-dimensional [[Level (video gaming)|worlds]] containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, that are used to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in ''Banjo-Kazooie'', a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Musical notes return in ''Banjo-Tooie'', but are now used to learn new moves from Bottles' brother, the drill sergeant Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's moves from the first game are immediately accessible in ''Banjo-Tooie'', and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, and the ability to play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt;

Another feature introduced in ''Banjo-Tooie'' is the direct connections between its worlds. In ''Banjo-Kazooie'' the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in ''Banjo-Tooie'' the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively extensions of the Isle o' Hags hub world.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; In addition, the train Chuffy can be used to migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customisable competitions.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

== Plot ==
Two years following Gruntilda's first defeat by Banjo and Kazooie, the two are playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, arrive in a large digging machine, the ''Hag 1'', and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately, Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down and put an end to her plans.

Following the witches' trail, Banjo and Kazooie arrive at Jinjo Village on the Isle o' Hags, where King Jingaling, king of all the Jinjos, explains that his subjects were frightened away by the ''Hag 1'' and scattered throughout the island. He gives the two their first Jiggy as a token of gratitude to help find them. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters introduce her to a cannon called the "Big-O-Blaster" (B.O.B.) that can suck the life force from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling, who consequently is turned into a zombie. Gruntilda plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island and use the stolen life force to restore her body. The witch's most loyal minion, [[List of characters in the Banjo-Kazooie series#Klungo|Klungo]], is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie in their progress by fighting them, but after taking many beatings from Gruntilda as punishment for losing to them, Klungo eventually abandons her and sides with Banjo and Kazooie.

Finally reaching Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie confront the witch and her sisters in a trivia quiz show named the ''Tower of Tragedy Quiz'' in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-ton weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter the top of the fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the ''Hag 1'' along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to the top of Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.

== Development ==
''Banjo-Tooie'' was developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and designed by [[Gregg Mayles]], who previously worked on ''Banjo-Kazooie''.&lt;ref name="Designer"/&gt; Development of the game started in June 1998.&lt;ref name="Power of Tooie"/&gt; Some features that were originally cut during the development of ''Banjo-Kazooie'', such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into ''Banjo-Tooie''.&lt;ref name="Cancelled worlds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancelled multiplayer"/&gt; An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep.&lt;ref name="tweet 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tweet 2"/&gt; The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.&lt;ref name="150 characters"/&gt;

Originally, Rare planned to include an additional mode, called "Bottles' Revenge", where a second player could play as an undead version of Bottles and take control of enemy characters to hinder Banjo in his quest, with the players swapping roles if the enemy character managed to defeat Banjo.&lt;ref name="Bottles' Revenge control"/&gt; The idea was ultimately scrapped because the developers ran out of time to debug it, despite admitting that "it did work rather well".&lt;ref name="Bottles Revenge"/&gt; However, it would later serve as the inspiration behind the "Counter-Operative" multiplayer mode in ''[[Perfect Dark]]''.&lt;ref name="Bottle's Revenge Perfect Dark"/&gt; Bosses were originally to be able to be controllable by the second player as well, but the only boss that the developers had working when they dropped the mode was the second world boss, 'Old King Coal'.&lt;ref name="Bottles Revenge"/&gt; The developers also planned to implement a feature, called "[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)#Stop 'N' Swop|Stop 'N' Swop]]", that would have allowed data to be transferred from ''Banjo-Kazooie'' to ''Banjo-Tooie'' so that players could unlock additional bonuses in ''Banjo-Tooie''. However, due to hardware limitations of the [[Nintendo 64]] system, the feature was ultimately dropped. Despite this, Rare decided to include at least some of the additional bonuses within the game. The Stop 'N' Swop feature was later implemented in the Xbox Live re-release.&lt;ref name="mtv-stop-n-swop"/&gt;

The music was composed by [[Grant Kirkhope]], who previously worked as the main composer for ''Perfect Dark'', ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', and ''Banjo-Kazooie''. As ''Banjo-Tooie'' was a larger game than its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game's cartridge for sound effects and music.&lt;ref name="Kirkhope"/&gt; Kirkhope initially had to pause his work on ''Banjo-Tooie'' to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time.&lt;ref name="Kirkhope"/&gt; Like the original, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player's location. Due to the game having larger memory space Kirkhope was able to combine two [[MIDI]] files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations.&lt;ref name="Kirkhope"/&gt; The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed.&lt;ref name="Late 99"/&gt; ''Banjo-Tooie'' was presented at the 2000 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and released on 20 November 2000.&lt;ref name="Release date"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E3 2000"/&gt; The game supports the Nintendo 64 [[Rumble Pak]].&lt;ref name="Rumble Pak"/&gt;

Upon release, ''Banjo-Tooie'' was critically acclaimed and sold more than three million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sales"/&gt; Johnny Liu of [[Game Revolution]] considered ''Banjo-Tooie'' to be less repetitive than ''Donkey Kong 64'' and a worthy successor to ''Banjo-Kazooie''.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' referred to ''Banjo-Tooie'' as "the perfect cross between ''Donkey Kong 64'' and ''Banjo-Kazooie''", noting that it features less backtracking between levels than ''Donkey Kong 64'' does.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Power review" /&gt; The publication also stated that the only disappointment was how Rare resolved the "Stop 'N' Swop" bonuses.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Power review" /&gt; Mark Green of ''[[N64 Magazine]]'' felt that, although ''Banjo-Tooie'' delivers "a decent complement of clever puzzles and enjoyable run-and-jump moments", it did not feel "as fresh or as exciting" as previous Rare platformers.&lt;ref name="N64 review"/&gt;

The graphics were considered some of the best on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures, long [[draw distance|drawing distance]], and real-time shadow generation, but were criticised for their inconsistent [[frame rate]] during certain points in the game.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; Nevertheless, [[GameSpot]] noted that the action level of the game was normally low enough that it "does not significantly distract from the experience".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Game Revolution said that the game was "beautiful", but it did not meet the same level of awe as its predecessor.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; The game was also praised for its humour, with ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' commenting that its characters are "impossible to dislike."&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt;

The gameplay was highlighted for the size of the game's worlds.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described ''Banjo-Tooie'' as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that "Keeping track of what you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking".&lt;ref name="GRUK review"/&gt; Similarly, ''[[GamePro]]'' remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do.&lt;ref name="GamePro review"/&gt; GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Despite the praise, ''Edge'' concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, ''Banjo-Tooie'' was awarded Best Platform Game.&lt;ref name="Best Platform Game"/&gt;

== Xbox 360 version ==
An [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of ''Banjo-Tooie'', developed by [[4J Studios]], was released for the [[Xbox 360]] on 29 April 2009. This version features a smoother [[frame rate]] and [[High-definition video|high-definition]] graphics, and supports the "[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)#Stop 'N' Swop|Stop 'N' Swop]]" connectivity with the Xbox Live Arcade version of its predecessor, allowing players to unlock the bonuses included in the original Nintendo 64 version as well as new content related to the Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="Rare readies Tooie"/&gt; Using the Stop 'N' Swop items in the Xbox Live Arcade version of ''Banjo-Tooie'' also unlocks additional bonuses in the "L.O.G.'s Lost Challenges" [[downloadable content]] for ''[[Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts]]''.&lt;ref name="SNS Nuts And Bolts" /&gt; The Xbox Live Arcade version of ''Banjo-Tooie'' received mixed to favourable reviews from video game critics, featuring an aggregate score of 73 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="BTXBLA metacritic"/&gt; In 2015, the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game was included as part of the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' video game compilation for [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref name="XONE version"/&gt;

'''''Bella Sara''''' is a children's card trading game that combines a world of magical horses with game play. Published by Seattle-based game company [[Hidden City Entertainment]], ''Bella Sara'' began as a [[trading card game]] that has since expanded into an international product line.  With three set releases each year, all trading cards have images of illustrated horses, characters and magical friends with positive, inspirational messages on them. Each card pack includes secret codes that can be redeemed on the website to care for and nurture magical horses online.  Select ''Bella Sara'' products include these secret codes to expand the magical world even further.
It was reported June 16, 2013 that the Bella Sara Company would be ceasing all operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://icv2.com/articles/games/view/25985/bella-sara-u-s-shut-down&lt;/ref&gt;
As of May 2018, the flash site is still up, but the store has been shut down.

==History==
''Bella Sara'' was started in Denmark by [[Gitte Odder Brændgaard]], who intended to create an alternative to other popular trading card games, such as ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game|Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', that would be more suited to girls and lack the element of competition present in the other games. After the game proved successful in [[Scandinavia]], the cards were released on a trial run to [[United States]] consumers in Seattle and San Diego at the end of 2006. Sales during that trial run were high enough to convince retailers to take the cards national in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/business/12bella.html?_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=business&amp;adxnnlx=1200098026-HFLEJekkTVnIPanUmgpwvg | title=With Ponies, Unicorns and Secret Codes, an Effort to Unleash a Craze for Girls | accessdate=2008-01-11 | first=Allen | last=Salkin | date=November 12, 2007 | publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the cards have continued to grow in popularity with children.

==Card availability==
Cards can be purchased in [[booster pack]]s, value boxes, and tins, each of which contains a random assortment of cards.

'''Benjamin Harkarvy''' (16 December 1930 in New York City – 30 March 2002 in New York City) was an American dance teacher, [[choreographer]], and [[artistic director]]. He earned an international reputation for his eclectic approach to dance education (particularly seen in his directorship of the [[Juilliard School]] Dance Division), as well as through his leadership of a number of prominent [[dance company|dance companies]].

Harkarvy began to study dance at the age of thirteen, already focused on the goal of teaching. Among his principal teachers were two highly regarded Russian expatriates: [[Edward Caton]] and [[Elizabeth Anderson-Ivantzova]]. Harkarvy studied primarily at the [[School of American Ballet]]. He had only a brief performing career, making his debut with the [[Brooklyn Lyric Opera]] at the age of eighteen and appearing in summer stock productions. From 1951 to 1955, he taught at [[Michel Fokine]]'s school in New York City, and, in 1955, he opened his own school. Harkarvy's first post with a dance company came in 1957 with the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]]. The following year he was named ballet master of the [[Dutch National Ballet]]. Unhappy over problems with that company, he and a number of the dancers broke away and formed [[Nederlands Dans Theater]] in 1959. Harkarvy and [[Hans van Manen]] co-directed this new company, which combined ballet and modern dance in its repertory, for a decade. In 1969, Harkarvy became co-director, with [[Lawrence Rhodes]], of the [[Harkness Ballet]], which was disbanded the following year. He then returned to the [[Dutch National Ballet]] for a year, but, from 1972 to 1982, he was affiliated with the [[Pennsylvania Ballet]]. For Pennsylvania Ballet he taught daily and re-staged several of his well-known ballets-Madrigalesco, Recital for Cello and 8 Dancers, Grand Pas Espagnol plus created several new works including Quartet, Time Passed Summer, Continuum, Four Men Waiting, From Gentle Circles, Signatures and Poems of Love and the Seasons. He also brought in choreographers including Hans van Manen, Charles Czarny, Margo Sappington, Lynne Taylor-Corbett, Rodney Griffin,  [[Goh Choo San|Choo San Goh]], to create works for the company. During this period, Harkarvy helped to raise the profile of the Philadelphia-based troupe, but he left in 1982 after the company began to experience severe financial difficulties. He subsequently held a variety of teaching positions before joining the Juilliard faculty in 1990. As director of the Juilliard's Dance Division from 1992, Harkarvy expanded existing programs and created innovative new ones, remaining with the school until the time of his death.

[[File:Beunans Meriasek (The life of St Meriasek) (f.56v.) Middle Cornish Saint's Play.jpg|thumb|Beunans Meriasek (f. 56 v.)]]
'''''Beunans Meriasek''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Life of Saint Meriasek'') is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] play completed in 1504. Its subject is the legends of the life of Saint [[Meriasek]] or Meriadoc, patron saint of [[Camborne]], whose veneration was popular in Cornwall, [[Brittany]], and elsewhere. It was written in the [[Cornish language]],  probably written around the same time and in the same place as ''[[Bewnans Ke]]'', the only other extant Cornish play taking a saint's life as its subject.

The manuscript of Beunans Meriasek is held in the [[Peniarth Manuscripts|Peniarth Collection]] at the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Alan M.|title=The literature of Cornwall : continuity, identity, difference, 1000-2000|date=2000|publisher=Redcliffe Press|location=Bristol|isbn=1900178281|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Outline==
The legend of [[Meriasek]], son of a [[Duke of Brittany]], who, for love of the [[priest]]ly profession, refused marriage with a wealthy princess and led the life of a miracle-working [[hermit]], first in [[Cornwall]] and afterwards in [[Brittany|his native land]]; the legend of [[Pope Sylvester I|Saint Sylvester]], who healed the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] of [[leprosy]] by a dip in the [[baptismal font]], and then aided him in establishing [[Christianity]] throughout his broad dominion; and the curious legend of a mother who, on the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]]'s continued disregard of her [[prayer]] for the deliverance of a son in [[Hostage|captivity]], carried off the [[Christ Child]] from the arms of the Virgin's statue, and refused to yield up the baby to the Madonna until her own son was restored to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Lee Bates|Bates, K.

'''Botnik Studios''' is an entertainment group developed to exhibit work created by the Botnik community, a writer's society of artists and developers who incorporate technology in the creation of comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title='He began to eat Hermione's family': bot tries to write Harry Potter book – and fails in magic ways|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/13/harry-potter-botnik-jk-rowling|website=the Guardian|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This content is published on the ''Botnik'' homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botnik Augmented Content|url=http://about.botnik.org/|website=Botnik|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Botnik's main tool is a predictive text keyboard, similar to one used by a smartphone. It offers options of words to type based on what has been previously entered, meaning that if the tool has analyzed a body of text it will find combinations of words likely to be used by a particular author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botnik Studios|url=http://botnik.org/tutorial.html|website=botnik.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose text has been 'scraped' by the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |host=The Cracked Podcast |title=How Predictive Text Gave Us A New Harry Potter Chapter |website= |publisher=Cracked |date=22 January 2018|time=21:38 |url=http://www.cracked.com/podcast/how-predictive-text-gave-us-new-harry-potter-chapter/ |accessdate=22 January 2018 |quote=the mass crowd driven thing came in the last year.

The '''Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984''' (codified at {{usctc|47|5|V–A}}) was an [[act of Congress]] passed on October 30, 1984 to promote competition and deregulate the [[cable television]] industry. The act established a national policy for the regulation of cable television communications by federal, state, and local authorities. Conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona wrote and supported the act, which amended the [[Communications Act of 1934]] with the insertion of "Title VI—Cable Communications". After more than three years of debate, six provisions were enacted to represent the intricate compromise between cable operators and municipalities.

==Provisions==
The scholarly article, "Perceived Impact of the Cable Policy Act of 1984," published in the ''[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]'' in 1987, described its objective as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The new law attempted to strike a delicate balance between the FCC, local governments, and marketplace competition, where in the past, each of these entities had vied for dominance. The Cable Act was to be the solution to the ongoing problem of who, or what, should exercise the most power over local cable operations.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Williams, Jr. | first1=Wenmouth | last2=Mahoney | first2=Kathleen | year=1987 | title=Perceived Impact of the Cable Policy Act of 1984 | journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume=31 | issue=2 | format=PDF | issn=0883-8151 | pages=193–205 | url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=31721976&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site | accessdate=2011-03-15 | doi=10.1080/08838158709386657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to balance power between cable television operators and the government, the act established regulations regarding franchise standards and proceeds that would attempt to strengthen the development of cable systems. The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations. By establishing an orderly process for franchise renewal, the act protected cable operators from unfair denials of renewal. However, in order to be granted a franchise renewal, the act specified that cable operators' past performances and future proposals had to meet the federal standards in the new title. The act was meant to reduce an unnecessary regulation that could have potentially brought about an excessive economic burden on cable systems.&lt;ref name="Meyerson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meyerson | first1=Michael I. | year=1985 | title=The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984: A Balancing Act on Coaxial Wires | journal=Georgia Law Review | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=543–662 | publisher= University of Baltimore School of Law Research Paper |  ssrn=1605276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for establishing franchise standards and procedures, the act specified that cable operators were expected to be receptive to their local communities' needs and interests.  
Congress recognized the vital role of [[cable television]] in encouraging and providing a place for free expression. This provision assured that cable communications provide the general public with "the widest possible diversity of information sources and services." Through this statute, Congress attempted to uphold the First Amendment interest of cable audiences to receive diversified information as specified in the ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission]]'' court case of 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants= Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. vs Federal Communications Commission | volume= 395 | reporter= U.S. | opinion= 367 | court= U.S. Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit | date=1969 | url=http://epic.org/free_speech/red_lion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision declared that state and local authorities should allow, but not mandate, that this type of information be distributed via [[non-commercial]] [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV channels. Furthermore, it prohibited cable operators from exerting any type of editorial control over program content broadcast through PEG channels and freed them from any potential liability for the content. The act lifted programming rules and subscription fees.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Myers | first1=John M. | last2=Schuering | first2=Daniel P. | year=1991 | title=Cable Television Franchise Renewals A Primer | magazine=Illinois Municipal Review: The Magazine of the Municipalities |  pages=22 | publisher=Illinois Municipal League | url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1991/im910121.html | accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this provision that inspired Senator Barry Goldwater to begin his work on the Cable Communications Act of 1984.

==History==
In 1972, the [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) issued the ''Third Report and Order.''&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=midwestvideo | title=Midwest Video Case: U.S. Legal Decisions and Cable Television | last= Epstein | first=Michael | work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications | accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was enacted to encourage consumer choice and innovation among video devices. The regulations adopted in the order established requirements for broadband, cellular, and wireline [[Personal Communications Services]] (PCS) carriers in compliance with the assistance capability requirements prescribed by the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]]. The FCC hoped that the newly adopted regulations would generate a competitive marketplace for various devices capable of accessing cable video services by allowing consumers to purchase smart video devices that were compatible with all multichannel video programming services. This would allow consumers the freedom to change service providers without changing their entertainment devices. The "Third Report and Order" resulted in the top 100 U.S. television markets providing three Public-access television channels, each for [[Public-access television]], [[Distance learning|Educational-access]], or [[Government-access television]] (GATV) (PEG) use. If demand was low for all three channels in a specific market, cable companies had the jurisdiction to supply fewer channels. At least one PEG channel was required at all times.&lt;ref name="Claire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.publicaccesstv.net/history05.html | title=Regulation and Franchising | last=Claire | first=Eau | date=2000-05-15 | work=Public Access Television | accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barry Goldwater photo1962.jpg|thumb|Sen. [[Barry Goldwater]] (R-AZ), the sponsor of the act.]]

In 1976, the regulation was expanded to include cable television systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers. Cable companies saw the regulation by the federal government as an unlawful intrusion into their business practices and immediately started to challenge its legality. In the court case ''United States v. Midwest Video Corp.,''&lt;ref name="USMidwest"&gt;{{cite court | litigants=United States v. Midwest Video Corp. | vol=406 | reporter=U.S. | opinion=649 | date=1972 | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/406/649/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Midwest Video Corporation sued the FCC for overstepping its authority in requiring Public-access television channels. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's requirements for [[Public-access television|local origination]] facilities. However, in 1979,  the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Midwest Video Corp. stating that the FCC's new requirements exceeded the agency's statutory powers as granted to them by Congress and as required by cable operators to provide Public-access television. The FCC was interfering with the agency's First Amendment rights.&lt;ref name="USMidwest"/&gt; After the Supreme Court's decision, PEG advocates started work on what became the Cable Communications Act of 1984.

The need for an act to determine who holds regulatory authority for cable communications was quite evident, however it took time to reach an agreement. Negotiations for the act lasted nearly two years and agreements moved back and forth between the House and the Senate. The two parties involved in the negotiations were the [[National League of Cities]] (NLC) and the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] (NCTA), formerly the National Cable Television Association.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; These parties worked to lobby Congress for their respective members, who represented diverse populations and had firm, unyielding interests. Instead of having Congress determine the outcome of a stalemate, the two organizations tried to present a unified front. This was a strategic move meant to increase the likelihood that the bill would be passed in both the House and the Senate.

The act began as bill S. 66 in the Senate where it was passed on June 14, 1983 and moved on to the House. The companion bill, H.R. 4103, in the House was passed on October 1, 1984 and returned to the Senate where modifications were made to conjoin the texts. The bill was officially passed on October 11, 1984 and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.millervaneaton.com/content.agentpage_name=1984+Cable+Act+Legislative+History | title=Cable Act Legislative History | work=Miller &amp; Van Eaton: A Liability Law Firm Specializing in Telecommunications for Local Governments |  accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During negotiations, the agreements were voided four times. The National League of Cities (NLC) voided agreements three times because cable companies were freed from rate regulation, given renewal expectancy, and could default on promises in certain circumstances. On the other hand, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NTCA) voided agreements once because they felt that another Supreme Court ruling would provide the industry with better rate deregulation than under the present FCC regulations or the bill.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

==Outcomes and debates==
The result of the act was an intricate, minimally influential agreement between cable operators and municipalities. It has been highly debated for its effectiveness, because evidence shows that unaffiliated [[television program]]ming on [[leased access]] channels was avoided and rarely appeared.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; As a title of the larger [[Communications Act of 1934]], the Cable Communications Act of 1984 has been amended and revised with the Cable Act of 1992, also referred to as [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]], and the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]].

The Cable Communications Act of 1984 had minimal advantages, because it was enacted around a strong legislative agreement between the demands of cable operators and the demands of the public. During the negotiation process, there was relatively little public participation, meaning cable consumers and [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) advocates were left vulnerable to cable operators' enforcement and decisions.

There was dramatic growth in the cable industry once the act went into effect.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Aufderheide | first1=Patricia | year=1992 | title=Cable Television and the Public Interest | journal=Journal of Communication | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=52–65 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing, LTD. | doi=10.1111/J.1460-2466.1992.tb.00768.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remained largely in the hands of few local monopolies that were able to determine the content of the programs and set the rates for services and channels on their system. These changes in authority were not immediate, but evolved over the course of a few years.&lt;ref name="Schmuckler"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmuckler |first1=Eric |last2=Dean | first2=Sidney W. Jr |date=1984-11-14 |title=The Cable TV Law Hurts The Public |newspaper=The New York Times |page=35 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/14/opinion/the-cable-tv-law-hurts-the-public.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable consumers were outraged with the increases in prices and services, whereas municipalities were annoyed with violated contracts. Many of these outcomes can be attributed to the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) interpretation of Congress' mandates, which contained poor choice of language and confusion over the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Aufderheide"/&gt;

Cable consumers' complaints about the outcomes led to policy discussions in the late eighties and early nineties in which public interest was considered but not represented.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide"/&gt; If monopolies were broken apart and competition was restored, then many of the problems would likely be resolved. Cable operators would not refuse to carry programs and services with popular demand, and prices would return to appropriate and economical rates.&lt;ref name="Netzer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Netzer |first1=Dick |date=1984-11-26 |title=Competition Is What The Cable Industry Needs |newspaper=The New York Times |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to address this problem, the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]] of 1992 was passed to regulate cable television rates that cable operators charged consumers.&lt;ref name="Gobetz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gobetz | first1=Robert | year=2008 | title=Communications Act of 1934 | journal=Encyclopedia of Political Communication | publisher=SAGE Publications | url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/politicalcommunication/Article_n111.html | accessdate=2011-02-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202015238/http://www.sage-ereference.com/politicalcommunication/Article_n111.html | archivedate=2013-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law, intending to grant privileges to local community members by allowing them to require PEG channels also allowed these municipalities to decide against PEG requirements. In franchise agreements, contracted between cable operators and municipalities, the municipality could specify a PEG channel requirement and later opt out of these channels, keeping the [[cable television franchise fee]]s for their general fund and supplying their communities with no PEG outlets or [[channel capacity]]. Since its approval, many public-access television centers have closed as a result of the opt-out provision.&lt;ref name="Claire"/&gt;

Since the act prevented cable operators from regulating publicly generated content, much controversy developed around what was allowed to appear on these channels. A public-access television center in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]] was faulted for televising a video created by Christian Bangert, a man convicted of murdering a city police officer. The tape was shown repeatedly during Bangert's trial, and many people felt its airing was in bad taste. Across the country, controversial content such as explicit sex and promotion of Nazi groups have aired via PEG channels. Congress, in an attempt to protect viewers from indecent programming, passed the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which allowed the FCC to establish rules requiring cable operators to prohibit particular shows. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the law was unconstitutional claiming that cable operators should never be required to act on behalf of the federal government to control expression in relation to content.&lt;ref name="Claire"/&gt;
 
Commercial leased access did not provide cable subscribers with a diversity of information as it was required, because it was avoided and never mandated by local franchising authority. In the 1998 court case ''Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC,'' the court deemed the act ineffective in terms of unaffiliated programming. "The 1984 legislation did not accomplish much. Unaffiliated programming on leased channels rarely appeared."&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lloyd | first1=Mark | year=2009 | title=Access to Media | journal=Encyclopedia of Journalism | publisher=SAGE Publications | url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/journalism/Article_n5.html | accessdate=2011-02-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201220419/http://www.sage-ereference.com/journalism/Article_n5.html | archivedate=2013-02-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act reinforced its intent that leased access to provide a diversity of information to subscribers as determined by the cable operators. The ''Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC'' court also upheld the provision mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;

'''Canción Nacional Chilena''' ({{lang-en|Chilean National Song}}) was the [[national anthem]] of [[Chile]], between 1819 and 1847. It was written by Bernardo de Vera y Pintado and composed by Manuel Robles.&lt;ref name=nacl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/cl-47.htm |title=National Anthems - Chile (1819-1847) |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |date= |publisher=www.nationalanthems.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyrics ==

&lt;poem&gt;
'''Chorus'''
Dulce patria, recibe los votos
con que Chile en tus aras juró
que, o la tumba serás de los libres,
o el asilo contra la opresión.

'''I'''
Ciudadanos: el amor sagrado
de la patria os convoca la lid:
libertad: es el eco de alarma,
la divisa: triunfar o morir.
El cadalso o la antigua cadena,
os presenta el soberbio español:
arrancad el puñal al tiraño,
quebrantad ese cuello feroz.

'''II'''
Habituarnos, quisieron tres siglos
del esclavo, a la suerte infelíz
que, al sonar de sus propias cadenas
más aprende a cantar, que a gemir.
Pero el fuerte clamor de la patria,
ese ruido espantoso acalló
y las voces de la independencia
penetraron hasta el corazón.

'''III'''
En sus ojos hermosos, la patria,
nuevas luces empieza a sentir
y, observando sus altos derechos,
se ha encendido en ardor varonil.
De virtud y justicia rodeada,
a los pueblos del orbe anunció:
que, con sangre de Arauco, ha firmado
la gran carta de emancipación.

'''IV'''
Los tiranos, en rabia, encendidos
y, tocando de cerca su fin,
desplegaron la furia impotente,
aunque en vano se halaga en destruir.
Ciudadanos: mirad en el campo
el cadáver del vil invasor,
que perezca ese cruel, que el sepulcro
tan lejano a su cuna buscó.

'''V'''
Esos valles también ved, chilenos
que, el eterno quiso bendecir,
y en que ríe la naturaleza,
aunque ajada del déspota vil.
Al amigo y al deudo más caro,
sirven hoy de sepulcro y de honor,
mas la sangre del héroe es fecunda,
y en cada hombre cuenta un vengador.

'''VI'''
Del silencio profundo en que habitan
esos manes ilustres, oíd
que, os reclamen venganza, chilenos,
y, en venganza a la guerra acudid.
De Lautaro, Colocolo y Rengo,
reanimad el nativo valor,
y empeñad el coraje en las fieras,
que la España, a extinguirnos, mandó.

'''VII'''
Esos monstruos que cargan consigo
el carácter infame y servil,
¿Cómo pueden jamás compararse
con los héroes del cinco de abril?
Ellos sirven al mismo tirano
que, su ley y su sangre burló...
por la patria, nosotros peleamos
nuestra vida lealtad y honor.

'''VIII'''
Por el mar y la tierra amenazan
los secuaces del déspota vil,
pero toda la naturaleza
los espera para combatir.
El Pacífico, al sud y occidente,
al oriente: los Ándes y el sol,
por el norte: un inmenso desierto
y el centro: libertad y unión.

'''IX'''
Ved la insignia con que, en Chacabuco,
al intruso supisteis rendir,
y el augusto tricolor que, en Maipo,
en un día de triunfo nos dio mil.
Vedle ya, señoreando un océano
y, flameando sobre el fiero león,
se estremece a su vista, el íbero,
nuestros pechos inflama el valor.

'''X'''
Ciudadanos, la gloria presida,
de la patria, el destino felíz,
y podrán, las edades futuras,
a sus padres, así bendecir.
Venturosas, mil veces, las vidas
con que Chile, su dicha afianzó...
si quedare un tirano, su sangre
de los héroes escriba el blasón.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Carol Elaine Channing''' (born January 31, 1921) is an [[United States|American]] actress, singer, dancer and comedian. Notable for starring in Broadway and film musicals, her characters typically radiate a fervent expressiveness and an easily identifiable voice, whether singing or for comedic effect. Carol Channing also studied acting at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York City.

She began as a Broadway musical actress, starring in ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' in 1949, and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in 1964, when she won the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]]. She revived both roles several times throughout her career, most recently playing Dolly in 1995. Channing was nominated for her first [[Tony Award]] in 1956 for ''[[The Vamp]]'' followed by a nomination in 1961 for ''Show Girl''. She received her fourth Tony Award nomination for the musical ''[[Lorelei (musical)|Lorelei]]'' in 1974.

As a film actress, she won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance as Muzzy in ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' (1967). Other film appearances include ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]'' (1956) and ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968). On television, she appeared as an entertainer on variety shows, from ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the 1950s to ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. She had a standout performance as The White Queen in the TV production of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1985 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1985), and had the first of many TV specials in 1966, ''An Evening with Carol Channing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ool5UYQtID8|title= An Evening with Carol Channing (1966)|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channing was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame|American Theatre Hall of Fame]] in 1981 and received a [[Lifetime Achievement Tony Award]] in 1995. She continues to perform and make appearances, singing songs from her repertoire and sharing stories with fans, [[cabaret]] style. She released an autobiography, titled ''Just Lucky I Guess'', in 2002, and ''Larger Than Life'', a documentary film about her career, was released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ_aQMAP5xM|title=Carol Channing, ''Larger Than Life'' (2012) - trailer|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Channing was born in [[Seattle, Washington]], on January 31, 1921,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=32144 "Carol Channing biography"] tcm.com; retrieved August 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the only child of Adelaide (née Glaser; 1886–1984) and George Christian Channing (1888-1957). Her mother was of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] descent and Channing considers herself "[[Half-Jewish|part-Jewish]]".&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|51}} Her father, who was [[multiracial]] (African American and German), changed his surname from Stucker to Channing before Carol's birth.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Channing, Carol. ''Just Lucky I Guess: A Memoir of Sorts'', Simon &amp; Schuster, (2002), {{ISBN|0743216067}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} A city editor at the ''[[Seattle Star]]'', he took a job in [[San Francisco]] and the family moved when Channing was two weeks old. He became a [[Christian Science]] practitioner, editor and teacher.

Channing attended Aptos Junior High School and [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School San Francisco]], graduating in 1938. She won the Crusaders' Oratorical Contest and a free trip to Hawaii with her mother in June 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Zinko, Carolyne (May 11, 2003). [http://www.lowellalumni.org/alumni_news.shtml "Carol Channing marries long-time sweetheart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061424/http://www.lowellalumni.org/alumni_news.shtml |date=2013-06-14}}, reprinted at [[Lowell Alumni Association|lowellalumni.org]]; retrieved June 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 16, she left home to attend [[Bennington College]] in [[Vermont]] and her mother told her for the first time that her father's mother was [[African Americans|African American]] and his father was [[German Americans|German American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wendyshow.com/2010/08/24/carol-channing-soul-sister/|work=The Wendy Show|title=Carol Channing on The Wendy Williams Show|accessdate=2015-10-06|date=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Her mother felt that the time was right to tell her since now that she was going off to college and would be on her own, she didn't want her to be surprised if she ever had a black baby.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=April 21, 2008|title=Carol Channing reveals her father was Black|date=November 4, 2002|publisher=''Jet''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0211/27/lkl.00.html|work=CNN|title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-22/features/0305220078_1_carol-channing-dolly-funny "At 82, Channing still in step"], Chicago Tribune, May 22, 2003; accessed May 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Channing told [[Larry King]] during an interview, that because her father's birth certificate was destroyed in a fire, she cannot verify the details beyond some old photos and what her mother told her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0211/27/lkl.00.html Larry King interview with Carol Channing], CNN, Nov. 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The November 4, 2002, issue of ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine reported, based on her autobiography, that Channing's father was African-American.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Channing writes:{{quote|I know it's true the moment I sing and dance. I'm proud as can be of [my black ancestry]. It's one of the great strains in show business. I'm so grateful. My father was a very dignified man and as white as I am. My [paternal] grandparents were Nordic German, so apparently I [too] took after them [in appearance].&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;}}

She majored in drama at Bennington and during an interview in 1994 admitted that she first wanted to perform on stage as a singer when she was in the fourth grade. She recalls being emotionally drawn to the stage after seeing [[Ethel Waters]] perform.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvdqEDBRpk;t=1m55s Carol Channing interview during the ''Hello, Dolly'' tour in 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has stated that in the fourth grade she ran for and was elected class secretary: "I stood up in class and campaigned by kidding the teachers. The other kids laughed. I loved the feeling{{mdash}}It was a very good feeling; it still is." She read the class minutes every Friday, often impersonating the children who were discussed.&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt; She also considers the fact that she was able to see plays while very young to have been an important inspiration:{{quote|I was lucky enough to grow up in San Francisco and it was the best theater town that [[Sol Hurok]] knew and he brought everybody from all over the world and we schoolchildren got to see them with just 50-cent tickets.&lt;ref name=Greenville/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Her election to class secretary continued through grammar and high school: "It was very good training—like stock"&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt; Those weekly sessions in front of students became a habit which she carried to Bennington College, where she would entertain every Friday night.&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt; During her junior year she began trying out for acting parts on Broadway. After playing a small part in revue, the ''New Yorker'' magazine noted her performance: "You'll be hearing more from a comedienne named Carol Channing."&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt;

The inspiration she received from that brief notice made her decide to quit school. However, it was four years before she found another acting job. During that period she performed at small functions or benefits, including some in the Catskill resorts. She also worked in Macy's bakery.&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt;

==Career==
Channing was introduced to the stage while helping her mother deliver newspapers to the backstage of theatres.{{efn|We went through the stage door alley (for the [[Curran Theatre]]), and I couldn't get the stage door open. My mother came and opened it very well. Anyway, my mother went to put the ''Monitors'' where they were supposed to go for the actors and the crew and the musicians, and she left me alone. And I stood there and realized – I'll never forget it because it came over me so strongly – that this is a temple. This is a cathedral. It's a mosque. It's a mother church. This is for people who have gotten a glimpse of creation and all they do is recreate it. I stood there and wanted to kiss the floorboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faires, Robert|title=The Carol You Don't Know|publisher=''Austin Chronicle'', Online Edition|date=July 22, 2005|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-07-22/arts_feature.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Her first job on stage in [[New York City|New York]] was in [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s ''No for an Answer,'' starting January 5, 1941, at the Mecca Temple (later New York's [[City Center]]). She was 19 years old. Channing moved to Broadway for ''[[Let's Face It!]]'', in which she was an understudy for [[Eve Arden]], who was 13 years older than Channing. Decades later, Arden would play Dolly in a road company after Channing finally relinquished her signature role.

Five years later, Channing had a featured role in ''Lend an Ear'' (1948), for which she received her [[Theatre World Award]] and launched her as a star performer. Channing credited illustrator [[Al Hirschfeld]] for helping make her a star when he put her image in his widely published illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIY6i_BtTLo;t=32s Al Hirschfeld Exhibit], WPIX News, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She said that his drawing of her as a flapper was what helped her get the lead in her next play, the [[Jule Styne]] and [[Anita Loos]] musical, [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'']]. From that role, as Lorelei Lee, she gained recognition, with her signature song from the production, "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]," among the most widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJd_rG6Jy4|title=Carol Channing - "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" (1957)|first=|last=vintage video clips|date=21 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg-XaWr_A3k|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, ''Time'' magazine ran a cover story about her becoming a new star on Broadway, followed by cover stories in ''Life'' magazine in 1955 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvdqEDBRpk;t=3m21s|title=Carol Channing Interview 1994 Hello, Dolly tour|first=|last=toldes|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirschfeld&gt;Leopold, David, ed.; Hirschfeld, Al (illustrations) ''The Hirschfeld Century: Portrait of an Artist and His Age'', Knopf Doubleday (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d5/77/ba/d577bad49fa1a6b0b97385322a15979a.jpg Hirschfeld illustration of Channing as Lady Macbeth]}}{{efn|[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1b/7e/6d/1b7e6db5e3e865c763f16fbab6c80d96.jpg Hirschfeld illustration of Channing with George Burns]}}{{efn|[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/6b/ff/796bff58ec8449bd5fe74fd230fa4266.jpg Hirschfeld illustration of Channing with Liza Minelli and Zero Mostel]}}{{efn|[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/57/19/69/571969a5fefb53bb342acea06c493a36.jpg Hirschfeld illustration of Channing with Matt Mattox in ''The Vamp'']}}

In 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. During the 1950s, he produced the [[Burns and Allen]] comedy show, which starred [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]].&lt;ref name=Orlando/&gt; When Allen was forced to discontinue performing due to medical problems, she saw that Burns was in need of a partner to play off of on stage since he was best as a straight man. She remembered that Channing, like her, had one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices in show business, and Lowe asked Channing if she would perform with Burns during his shows. She accepted immediately, and Channing worked on and off with Burns through the late 1950s. Burns also appeared in her TV special, "An Evening with Carol Channing", in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ool5UYQtID8;t=43m42s|title=An Evening with Carol Channing 1966|first=|last=keywslt|date=20 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Channing became one of the few performers nominated for a Tony Award for work in a revue (rather than a traditional book musical); she was nominated for [[Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Actress in a Musical]] for the short-lived revue ''Show Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1961 Tony Award Winners - Browse by Year|url=http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1961|work=BroadwayWorld.com|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hello, Dolly!'' (1964)===
[[File:Carol Channing - 1964.jpg|thumb|David Burns and Channing in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964)]]
Channing came to national prominence as the star of [[Jerry Herman]]'s ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly]]!'' (1964). Her performance as Dolly Levi won the Tony Award for [[Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Actress in a Musical]]. She recalls that playwright [[Thornton Wilder]] so loved the musical, which was based on his play, ''The Matchmaker'', that he came once a week.&lt;ref name=Orlando/&gt; He also planned to rewrite his 1942 play ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', with Channing playing the parts of both Mrs. Antrobus and Sabina, but died before he could finish it.&lt;ref name=Orlando/&gt;

Her role became widely popular in the 1960s, and she was often invited to major events, including those at the White House, where she might sing. In 1964, for instance, she was invited to the Democratic convention where she sang a take-off song, "Hello, Lyndon", for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (LBJ)'s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbFmiECNojA Carol Channing at DNC for Lyndon Johnson, 1964], FilmArchives NYC&lt;/ref&gt; She was a favorite of [[Lady Bird Johnson]], who once gave her a massive bouquet after a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvdqEDBRpk;t=4m26s|title=Carol Channing Interview 1994 Hello, Dolly tour|date=October 24, 2010|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old-fashioned plot of ''Hello, Dolly'', when first described, might seem uninspired, says columnist [[Dick Kleiner]]:{{quote|But then you sit in the audience and Carol Channing comes out, turns on her huge eyes and monumental smile—and you sit there with a silly grin on your face for 2 1/2 hours, bathed in the benevolent spell of a great comedienne...It is hard to imagine her doing anything else but making people smile. She is that human curio, the born female comic.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;Kleiner, Dick. "Analyze ''Hello, Dolly'' and You Get Carol Channing", ''The Progress-Index'' (Petersburg, Virginia), July 9, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The show had first opened on Broadway on January 16, 1964, and by the time the show closed in late December 1970, it had become the longest-running musical in Broadway history, with nearly 3,000 performances. Besides Channing, six other stars played the title role during those seven years: [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Phyllis Diller]] and [[Ethel Merman]].&lt;ref&gt;"'Hello Dolly' Closing After Record Run", ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', December 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carol Channing - 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Palmer and Channing in ''[[Lorelei (musical)|Lorelei]]'' (1973)]]
Al Hirschfeld's illustration of her was printed on the front page of the "Sunday Theatre" section of the ''New York Times'', which she feels captured the essence of her character: "How did the great Hirschfeld know precisely what I was thinking? ... To be Hirschfelded is an eerie experience. You better not have anything to hide, because he'll expose it like a neon sign", she wrote.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|68}}{{efn|[http://behindthescenes.nyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Channing.png Hirschfeld illustration of Channing in ''Hello, Dolly]}} The illustration was also printed on the cover of magazines, including ''Horizon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2d/46/19/2d4619b9b90f5ad11fb79150326e979c.jpg|title=Hirschfeld cover image of Carol Channing|publisher=pinimg.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later appeared in the movie biography about his life, [[The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story|''The Line King'']], in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Line-King-Al-Hirschfeld-Story/dp/B00020VZVG ''The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story''], Amazon Books (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Channing reprised her role of Lorelei Lee when the musical ''[[Lorelei (musical)|Lorelei]]'', directed by [[Robert Moore (director)|Robert Moore]] and choreographed by Ernest O. Flatt, premiered in 1973 at the Oklahoma City (6000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall and broke all box office records after six days' worth of performances sold out within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/2083304|work=NewsOK|title=Well, Hello, Carol!

To commemorate this record event, the street running in front of the Music Hall was renamed Channing Square Drive in her honor. Also in the cast were [[Peter Palmer (actor)|Peter Palmer]], [[Brandon Maggart]], [[Dody Goodman]], and [[Lee Roy Reams]]. For nearly a year, the stage musical then toured 11 cities across the country. ''[[Lorelei (musical)|Lorelei]]'' had already earned a hefty profit by the time it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] on January 27, 1974, and ran for a total of 320 performances. Channing also appeared in two [[New York City]] revivals of ''Hello, Dolly!'', and toured with it extensively throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/5017/Hello-Dolly|work=Playbill Vault|title=Hello, Dolly! on Broadway|accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed songs from ''Hello, Dolly'' during a special television show in London in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVh9zjf0Tww ''Hello, Dolly'' (London appearance, 1979)], youtube.com; accessed January 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' (1967)===
She also appeared in a number of films, including ''The First Traveling Sales Lady'' (1956; with [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]), the cult film ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'', and ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' (starring [[Julie Andrews]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[John Gavin]], and [[Beatrice Lillie]]).

Due to her success on Broadway in ''Hello Dolly!'' and her co-starring role in ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', Channing attracted the attentions of [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]], who were interested in starring her in a sitcom. Directed and produced by Arnaz and written by [[Bob Carroll, Jr.]] and [[Madelyn Davis]] (who co-wrote ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Lucy Show]]''), ''The Carol Channing Show'' starred Channing as Carol Hunnicut, a small-town girl trying and failing to make it in New York City show business. Character actors [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] and [[Jane Dulo]] were in the supporting cast. The pilot was filmed in front of a live audience (with a laugh track added) at [[Desilu]] in 1966, but did not sell as a series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239282/ "The Carol Channing Show" (1966)], IMDB.com; accessed July 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, she won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]]. During her film career, Channing also made some guest appearances on television sitcoms and talk shows, including ''[[What's My Line?]]'' where she appeared in 11 episodes from 1962 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgg2VPHB6PY Carol Channing on ''What's My Line'']&lt;/ref&gt; Channing did voice-over work in cartoons, most notably as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] in an animated version of ''[[The Addams Family]]'' from 1992-95.

===Television appearances===
During most of her career, she was asked to perform in various skits or appear as a guest on regular shows. In the 1960s, she was on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G502-aSNs1Y|title=Carol Channing &amp; Andy Williams - HILARIOUS Cecilia Sisson Comedy Sketch|first=|last=NedNickerson2010|date=28 September 2012|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she played the role of the White Queen in the television special ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1985 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrjIVhIeGnw Carol Channing in ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Channing appeared on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and sang a parody of the song "[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]" called "Hello, Sammy!", a love song being sung by Carol to a character known as Sammy the Snake (as voiced by [[The Muppets|Muppets]] creator [[Jim Henson]]). Carol, in this parody segment, serenades Sammy telling him just how much she loves and adores him while Sammy coils himself around Carol's arms. Carol's song includes lyrics such as: "So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I'll stake a claim on you".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|0-UMlJhgQbY|Carol Channing sings to Sammy the Snake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter [[Jule Styne]], who wrote the score for ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'', invited her on his television special in 1987 where she performed another one of her signature songs, "Little Girl from Little Rock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzj6syPASUE|title=Little Girl from Little Rock - Carol Channing|date=September 13, 2009|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, she poked a little fun at herself in an episode of ''[[The Nanny]]''. The episode "Smoke Gets in Your Lies" shows the producer auditioning for a new musical and Channing, playing herself, is trying out. Just after the producer announces he wants a stage presence that is instantly recognizable to the entire country, Channing begins with her signature "[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]", but he stops her with a resounding "Next!".

In January 2003, Channing recorded the audiobook of her best-selling autobiography ''Just Lucky, I Guess: A Memoir of Sorts'', directed and produced by Steve Garrin at VideoActive Productions in New York City. It was during the recording sessions that she received a phone call from her childhood sweetheart Harry Kullijian that rekindled their romance and led to their marriage a few months later. In January 2011, the documentary ''Carol Channing: Larger Than Life'' (which chronicles Channing's life and career) was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/20/entertainment/la-et-capsules-carol-channing-20120120 "Documentary film about Carol Channing premieres in January 2011"], latimes.com, January 20, 2012; accessed September 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Carol Channing.jpg|thumb|left|Channing in 2009]]
Channing has been married four times. Her first husband was Theodore Naidish, whom she married when she was 20 in 1941. He was a writer, who in 1944 wrote ''Watch Out for Willie Carter'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Willie-Carter-theodore-naidish/dp/B001R9PQKC/ ''Watch Out For Willie Carter''], ''Amazon Books''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|52}} but during the nearly five years of their marriage, earned little income: "There was no money for food, clothing or housing."&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|52}}

They lived near his grandparents in [[Brighton Beach]]. She remembers his grandfather, Sam Cohen, describing his life back in Russia before he immigrated. Cohen also introduced her to some of his neighborhood friends, who were amazed that she enjoyed hearing their funny stories. "They were delighted that I almost ate them up alive," she says, "because they were so funny, especially since such appreciation was coming from what we all thought then was a shiksa (me)." She learned to speak fluent [[Yiddish]] from "Grandpa Cohen", a skill which helped her understand the boardwalk conversations that went on around her in town.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;{{rp|51}}

Her second husband [[Alex Carson|Alexander Carson]] played center for the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] [[Canadian football]] team. They had one son named Channing Carson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JONWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;q=carol%20channing%20son|title=Nothing Like a Dame: Conversations with the Great Women of Musical Theater|author=Shapiro, Eddie|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. They remained married for 42&amp;nbsp;years. During this time, her son Channing Carson took his stepfather's surname; he publishes his cartoons as Chan Lowe and has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonbox.slate.com/chanlowe|title=Meet Chan Lowe|publisher=Slate|accessdate=April 21, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516063112/http://cartoonbox.slate.com/chanlowe|archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing filed for divorce from Lowe in 1998, but her estranged husband died before the divorce was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/05/local/me-7137|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Obituaries: Charles Lowe; Husband of Carol Channing|author=Oliver, Myrna|date=1999-09-05|accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lowe's death and until shortly before her fourth marriage, the actress's companion was Roger Denny, an interior decorator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/10/24/DD225951.DTL|title=Looking swell: Carol Channing's back in the spotlight with memoir and plans for new show|first=Steven|last=Winn|date=October 24, 2002|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, while recording the audiobook of her autobiography ''Just Lucky, I Guess'', at VideoActive Productions, NYC, Produced and Directed by Steve Garrin, she rekindled her romance with her junior high school sweetheart, Harry Kullijian, and they married on May 10, 2003. They later performed at their old junior high school in a benefit for the school. They also promoted arts education in California schools through their '''Dr. Carol Channing and Harry Kullijian Foundation'''. The couple resided in [[Rancho Mirage, California]]. Harry Kullijian died on December 26, 2011, the eve of his 92nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-kullijian-carol-channings-husband-276501|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title=Harry Kullijian, Carol Channing's Husband, Dies|author=Barnes, Mike|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording of Carol's autobiography has never been publicly released.

Channing has unique dietary habits. In 1978, she said she hadn't eaten restaurant food in 15 years, and preferred only organic food. When invited to restaurants, she would bring several sealed containers with her own food, such as zucchini or chopped celery, and simply ask for an empty plate and glass. For dessert, she would eat seeds. Nor would she drink alcoholic beverages of any sort.&lt;ref name=Orlando&gt;"Enchanting Channing: 'Oh, oh, oh, fellas; look at the old girl now, fellas'",''The Orlando Sentinel'' Nov. 24, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Channing is an [[ovarian cancer]] survivor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outinperth.com/index.php/life/ovarian-cancer-the-reality?date=2011-03-13 "Carol Channing on her battle with ovarian cancer"], outinperth.com; accessed September 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Channing is a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and showed her support for [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s campaign for president by singing ''Hello, Lyndon'', a version of ''Hello, Dolly'', at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/21/archives/hello-lyndon-joins-campaign-at-democratic-parley-next-week-herman.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dead Grandma'''''  is a 10-episode comedy [[Web series]] created by [[Will Kindrick]]. It is written by Kindrick, Courtney Branning, Matt Heder and is produced by Mummy Space Island Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummy Space Island Productions IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0327195/|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series follows the life of a hapless young college student Andy (Matt Heder), whose grandma (Beverly Welsh) comes back from the dead to help him find love. The series is hosted by [[Jon Heder]] who begins each episode with a campy intro reminiscent of the openings of nostalgic shows such as [[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theater]] and [[Wonderful World of Disney|The Wonderful World of Disney]].

Each episode follows a two-act structure split up by the opening title sequence and theme song.  The series is often abruptly interrupted by parody commercial breaks. A [[Public service announcement|PSA]] starring a Dead Grandma cast member is also featured after the end credits of every episode.

== Production ==

Dead Grandma combines live action with an animated sky and cloud background. The production took place over the course of two weekends in March &amp; April 2010. Filming locations included [[Art center college of design|Art Center College of Design]], [[Pasadena City College]], Cafe 50's, Big Mama's Rib Shack and various locations in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Studio City]]. The series was mentored by television and film director [[Jeremiah S. Chechik|Jeremiah Chechick]].

== Inspiration ==

The writers often referred to the protagonist Andy as a [[self-deprecating]] [[Charlie Brown]]-type character from ''[[Peanuts]]'' since he is consistently bullied and fails and nearly everything he attempts. The tone of the series was heavily influenced by 1990s sitcoms such as ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

== Setting ==

Dead Grandma takes place in the fictional city of Notpasadena where Andy and his classmates attend the shady Notpasadena Community College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dead Grandma: Our new favorite webseries|url=http://www.theknifefight.com/site/content.php/237-Our-new-favorite-web-series-Dead-Grandma|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==

=== Original Score ===

The score was written and performed by Garrick Hargrove and heavily features [[ukulele]], chimes and shakers. The theme song melody is often revisited and reprised throughout the score. Several other original songs were written for specific episodes including "Delicious Creamy Sweets" written &amp; performed by Ben Lazarus and "Super Exciting Pirate Adventure Explosion the Move 2" written &amp; performed by Amos Watene, Aaron Watene, Matt Heder, Will Kindrick and Ryan Augustine.

=== Theme Song ===

The theme song pays homage to classic campy 1950's-60's television series. The song was written by Will Kindrick and performed, arranged and recorded by the [[Brea, California|Brea California]] based a cappella group, "Soundstage".

== Benefit Show ==

A benefit fundraiser concert was held July 30, 2010 on the roof top of the [[Pomona Fox Theater|Fox Theater in Pomona CA]] to raise proceeds for the series. The show featured musical acts [[GOGO13#GOGO13|GOGO13]], [[Digital Unicorn]] and Eyes Lips Eyes.

'''Gerald Glynn '''"'''Dirk'''"''' West''' (1930 – July 26, 1996) was an [[editorial cartoon]]ist, [[journalist]], and mayor from [[Lubbock, Texas]], most famous for his [[caricature]]s of [[college|collegiate]] [[mascots]]. He was born in [[Littlefield, Texas]] but his family moved to Lubbock soon after. He attended [[Texas Tech University]] where he drew cartoons for ''[[The Daily Toreador|The University Daily]]'' student newspaper. He appeared as "Uncle Dirk" on a local children's program for three years while heading up his advertising agency, West Advertising. Beginning in the 1960s, he cartooned for the ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''.

==Mascot cartoons==
West's most famous works featured caricatures of the sports mascots of various universities, mostly those of the [[Southwest Conference]] (and later the [[Big 12 Conference]]), but other schools appeared as well, usually because they were playing Texas Tech. His cartoons appeared in program books, on posters, and in magazines.

Two of his characters would eventually be officially adopted by their respective universities: Texas Tech's [[Raider Red]] and the [[University of Nebraska]]'s [[Herbie Husker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huskernews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/01/20/3c4b73b0a915a Husker Press Box - Whatever Happened To Harry Husker?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415151139/http://www.huskernews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/01/20/3c4b73b0a915a |date=2006-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

West drew a semi-weekly one-panel [[comic strip|comic]] in the ''Avalanche-Journal'''s sports section where he would lampoon college mascots and coaches alike, as well as the stereotypes of various universities. Thus there was the dim-witted [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M Aggie]], the devout but overemotional [[Baylor University|Baylor Bear]], the arrogant [[University of Texas at Austin]] [[Texas Longhorn Athletics|Longhorn]] and of course [[Raider Red]], whose bullet-riddled [[Stetson]] showed by the number of holes the number of game losses for Texas Tech so far that season.

West would alter the image of his characters over the course of a sports season. A winning team's mascot would gradually get larger and tougher, the fans of losing teams would find their mascots growing thinner as the weeks went by.

==Politics==
After serving several years on the local Parks and Recreation Board and the [[Council-manager government|city council]], West was elected [[mayor]] of Lubbock in 1978, but disliked politics so much as a result that he did not run for a second term (his single term ran from 1978-1980). He returned to his advertising agency and his cartooning, both of which he kept up until his death from a heart attack in 1996.

An exhibition dedicated to West and his work opened September 25, 2005, at the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. It ran through January 2006.

'''Elaine Stritch''' (February 2, 1925 – July 17, 2014) was an American actress and singer, known for her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She made her professional stage debut in 1944 and appeared in numerous stage plays, musicals, feature films and television series. She was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]] in 1995.

Stritch made her Broadway debut in the 1946 comedy ''Loco'' and went on to receive four [[Tony Award]] nominations: for the [[William Inge]] play ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956); the  [[Noël Coward]] musical ''[[Sail Away (musical)|Sail Away]]'' (1962); the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1971), which included her performance of the song "The Ladies Who Lunch"; and for the revival of the [[Edward Albee]] play ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1996). Her one-woman show ''[[Elaine Stritch at Liberty]]'', won the 2002 [[Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event]].

Stritch relocated to London in the 1970s and starred in several [[West End theatre|West End]] productions, including [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[Small Craft Warnings]]'' (1973) and [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Gingerbread Lady]]'' (1974). She also starred with [[Donald Sinden]] in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] sitcom ''[[Two's Company (TV series)|Two's Company]]'' (1975–79), which earned her a 1979 [[BAFTA TV Award]] nomination. She won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1993 for her guest role on ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' and another for the 2004 television documentary of her one-woman show. From 2007 to 2012, she had a recurring role as [[Colleen Donaghy]] on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'', a role that won her a third Emmy in 2007.

==Early life==
Stritch was born on February 2, 1925, in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;Tallmer, Jerry.

==Career==

===Early stage career===
Stritch made her stage debut in 1944. However, her Broadway debut was in ''Loco'' in 1946, directed by [[Jed Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1467 "'Loco' Listing"], IBDb.com;  accessed May 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; followed soon after by ''Made in Heaven'' (as a replacement) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1470 "'Made in Heaven' Listing"], IBDb.com; accessed May 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and then ''Angel in the Wings'' (1947), a revue in which she performed comedy sketches and the song "[[Civilization (1947 song)|Civilization]]".&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/stritch_e.html Elaine Stritch profile], pbs.org, accessed May 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stritch understudied [[Ethel Merman]] for ''[[Call Me Madam]]'', and, at the same time, appeared in the 1952 revival of ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', singing "Zip".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Stritch later starred in the national tour of ''Call Me Madam'', and appeared in a supporting role in the original Broadway production of William Inge's play ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]''. In 1958 she originated the leading role of Maggie Harris in the musical ''[[Goldilocks (musical)|Goldilocks]]''.

She starred in [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Sail Away (musical)|Sail Away]]'' on Broadway in 1961. Stritch started in the show in a "relatively minor role and was only promoted over the title and given virtually all the best songs when it was reckoned that the leading lady...although excellent, was rather too operatic for a musical comedy".&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan Morley [https://books.google.com/books?id=iQyQNfaIKXwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Coward+%22Sail+Away%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Coward%20%22Sail%20Away%22&amp;f=false "Chapter:Pomp and Circumstance"], ''Noël Coward'', Haus Publishing, 2005; {{ISBN|1-904341-88-8}}, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; During out-of-town tryouts in Boston, Coward was "unsure about the dramatic talents" of one of the leads, opera singer [[Jean Fenn]].&lt;ref name=noel&gt;Hoare, Philip. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CkGniAsKUmYC&amp;pg=PA464&amp;dq=Coward+%22Sail+Away%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Coward%20%22Sail%20Away%22&amp;f=false "Sail Away"], ''Noel Coward: A Biography'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-226-34512-2}}, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They were, after all, engaged for their voices and...it is madness to expect two singers to play subtle 'Noël Coward' love scenes with the right values and sing at the same time.&lt;ref name=noel/&gt;}}

[[Joe Layton]] suggested "What would happen if...we just eliminated [Fenn's] role and gave everything to Stritch?  The show was very old-fashioned, and the thing that was working was Elaine Stritch.  Every time she went on stage [she] was a sensation." The reconstructed 'Sail Away' opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on October 3, 1961",&lt;ref name=noel/&gt; with Stritch giving what Howard Taubman of The New York Times said "must be the performance of her career."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Weber &amp; Robert Berkvist. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/theater/elaine-stritch-tart-tongued-broadway-actress-and-singer-is-dead-at-89.html?_r=0 "'Elaine Stritch, Broadway’s Enduring Dame, Dies at 89"] New York Times, July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, she played Ruth Sherwood in the musical ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' at New York's City Center, and appeared in an Off Broadway revival of ''[[Private Lives]]'' in 1968.

Stritch became known as a singer with a brassy, powerful voice.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} She was the original performer cast in the role of Joanne in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970) on Broadway. After over a decade of successful runs in shows in New York, Stritch moved in 1972 to London, where she starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of ''Company''. On tour and in stock, Stritch appeared in such musicals as ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[I Married an Angel]]'', and both as Vera Charles (opposite [[Janet Blair]]) and Mame Dennis in ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]''.

===Television===
[[File:Elaine Stritch 2009.jpg|thumb|Elaine Stritch in 2009]]
Strich's earliest television appearances were in ''[[The Growing Paynes]]'' (1949) and the ''[[Goodyear Television Playhouse]]'' (1953–55).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 17, 2014|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elaine-stritch-dies-at-89/|title=Actress Elaine Stritch dies at 89|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared on episodes of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 17, 2014|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/elaine-stritch-dead-89-gallery-1.1870910?pmSlide=1.1871185|title=Elaine Stritch and Ed Sullivan, 1954|newspaper=Daily News|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first and original Trixie Norton in a ''[[The Honeymooners|Honeymooners]]'' sketch with [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Art Carney]] and [[Pert Kelton]]. The character was originally a burlesque dancer, but the role was rewritten and recast after just one episode with the more wholesome looking [[Joyce Randolph]] playing the character as an ordinary housewife.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;

Stritch's other television credits included a number of dramatic programs in the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Studio One (radio-TV series)|Studio One]]''. In the 1960 television season, Stritch appeared in the role of writer Ruth Sherwood in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[My Sister Eileen (TV series)|My Sister Eileen]]'', opposite [[Shirley Bonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barnes, Mike|date=July 17, 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/elaine-stritch-dead-broadway-legend-719301|title=Broadway Legend Elaine Stritch Dies at 89|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as her younger sister, Eileen Sherwood, an aspiring actress. The sisters, natives of [[Ohio]], live in a brownstone apartment in [[Greenwich Village]]. The one-season series aired opposite ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and ''[[Kraft Music Hall (TV series)|Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall]]'' on [[NBC]].

In 1975, Stritch starred in the British [[LWT]] comedy series ''[[Two's Company (TV series)|Two's Company]]'' opposite Sir [[Donald Sinden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brockes, Emma|date=July 16, 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jul/16/theatre.broadway|title='I'm a do-it-myself kind of broad': Two decades of sobriety have been good to Elaine Stritch.

Sinden played Robert, her English butler, who disapproved of practically everything Dorothy did and the series derived its comedy from the inevitable culture clash between Robert's very British stiff-upper-lip attitude and Dorothy's devil-may-care New York view of life. ''Two's Company'' was exceptionally well received in Britain and ran for four series until 1979.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;Walker, Tim.

In 1980, Stritch starred in another series for LWT, ''Nobody's Perfect'' (the British version of ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'') - not to be confused with the [[Nobody's Perfect (TV series)|1980 American series of the same name]], which aired in the UK as ''Hart Of The Yard'' - playing Bill Hooper alongside [[Richard Griffiths]] as her husband Sam. Unsatisfied with the Anglicised scripts, Stritch herself adapted the original American scripts for all but one of the fourteen episodes (Griffiths handled the remaining one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewisohn, Mark|title=''Radio Times Guide To TV Comedy''|publisher=BBC|ISBN=0 563 48755 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other British television appearances by Strich included [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''. Although she appeared several times in different roles, perhaps her most memorable appearance was in the story "[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]", in which she played the wife of a man who has cheated death by having his brain preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Longsdorf, Amy|date=October 4, 2004|title=Mixpicks: DVD: Tales of the Unexpected: Set One|newspaper=The Record|page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared on [[BBC One|BBC 1]]'s children's series, ''[[Jackanory]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marshall, Ray|date=July 6, 2005|title=Reading stars|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; reading, among other stories, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' by [[Roald Dahl]].

After returning to the United States, she appeared on ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' as vinegary nanny Mrs. DeGroot, then was cast as a regular on the short-lived ''[[The Ellen Burstyn Show]]'' in 1986. She appeared as the stern schoolteacher Mrs. McGee on three episodes of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' (1989–90). She had a recurring role in ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (1992, 1997) as Lanie Stieglitz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834626/ "Elaine Stritch Films"] imdb.com, retrieved February 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2007, she began guest appearances on the NBC sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'' as [[Colleen Donaghy|Colleen]], the fearsome mother of [[Alec Baldwin]]'s lead character, [[Jack Donaghy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/30-rock/elaine-stritch-talks-about-her-25221.aspx |title=Elaine Stritch Talks About Her Guest Stint on '30 Rock' |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her later roles included Judge Grace Lema on ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'' (1998); and Martha Albright (mother of [[Jane Curtin]]'s character) on two episodes of ''3rd Rock From the Sun'' (1997, 2001), alongside her Broadway co-star [[George Grizzard]], who played George Albright.&lt;!--hide minor aside (the names George and Martha were a play on the characters Stritch and Grizzard played in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]]''). {{cn|date=July 2014}}--&gt;

Stritch was reportedly considered for the role of Dorothy Zbornak on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' but, as she related in her show ''Elaine Stritch at Liberty'', she "blew her audition".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; Lithgow, John (2007). ''Sitcoms: The 101 Greatest TV Comedies of All Time''. Black Dog Publishing; {{ISBN|1-57912-752-5}}, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt; The role was cast with [[Beatrice Arthur]]. She was seen on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' (1993), replacing fellow stage legend [[Eileen Heckart]] as Wilma Bern.

===Film roles===
Stritch appeared in more films in her later years than the early part of her career. In an interview in 1988, it was noted that "Making movies is challenging to Stritch since she considers herself a novice." She said: "I'm fascinated with it. And I want to do more of them." She was asked why she waited so long to make movies since she apparently enjoys it so much. "You do a movie for, like, three months and then you're finished. You do a part in a play and it's like going into a roomful of audiences for a year."&lt;ref name=mcall&gt;Willistein, Paul.[http://articles.mcall.com/1988-12-03/entertainment/2661381_1_elaine-stritch-gilford-cocoon "Stage Star Elaine Stritch Wrapped Up In A New Career"], mcall.com, December 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in her career, she appeared in ''[[Three Violent People]]'' (1956) starring [[Charlton Heston]], as the hotel proprietor pal of [[Anne Baxter]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049849/ "'Three Violent People' Listing"] Internet Movie Database, accessed May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and then co-starred opposite [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Jennifer Jones]] in the [[David O.

===BBC Radio===
In 1982, Stritch appeared on an edition of the long-running BBC Radio comedy series ''[[Just a Minute]]'' alongside [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Clement Freud]] and [[Barry Cryer]]. The show was described by long-time chairman [[Nicholas Parsons]] as being among the most memorable because of the way Stritch stretched the show's rules.

She appeared in a one-night only concert of ''Company'' in 1993 and as Parthy in a Broadway revival of the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' in 1994.

In 1996 she played Claire in a revival of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'', with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' writing: "Equally marvelous is Stritch, with a meatier role than her recent foray as Parthy in '''Show Boat''.'

====''Elaine Stritch at Liberty''====
{{Main|Elaine Stritch at Liberty}}
Her one-woman show ''Elaine Stritch at Liberty'', a summation of her life and career, premiered at New York's [[Public Theater]], running from November 7 to December 30, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Michael. "It's curtains for 'Kate' and Elaine'", ''The Star-Ledger'' (Newark, New Jersey), December 28, 2001, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It then ran on Broadway at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]] from February 21 to May 27, 2002, and then, also in 2002, at London's [[Old Vic Theatre]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Veronica Horwell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/18/elaine-stritch-everybody-rise-broadway-dame |title=Elaine Stritch: everybody rise for Broadway's greatest dame &amp;#124; Stage |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[Newsweek]]'' noted:

{{quote|Now we see how ''At Liberty'', the amazing one-woman show Stritch is moving to Broadway from the Public Theater this week, acquired the credit, ''"Constructed by [[John Lahr]]. Reconstructed by Elaine Stritch"''. "The reconstruction means I had the last say", she says. "Damn right I did." ... In case you didn't notice, Stritch is not the kind of woman who goes in for the sappy self-indulgence that pollutes most one-person shows. In fact, ''At Liberty'' is in a class by itself, a biting, hilarious and even touching tour-de-force tour of Stritch's career and life. Almost every nook and cranny of "At Liberty" holds a surprise. Turns out she dated [[Marlon Brando]], [[Gig Young]] and [[Ben Gazzara]], though she dropped Ben when [[Rock Hudson]] showed an interest in her. "And we all know what a bum decision that turned out to be", she says. And then there were the shows. A British writer recently called Stritch ''"Broadway's last first lady"'', and when you see her performing her signature numbers from ''Company'' and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' and hear her tell tales of working with [[Ethel Merman|Merman]], [[Noël Coward|Coward]], [[Gloria Swanson]] and the rest, it's hard to argue. Especially since she does it all dressed in a long white shirt and form-fitting black tights. It's both a metaphor for her soul-baring musical and a sartorial kiss-my-rear gesture to anyone who thinks there isn't some life left in the 76-year-old diva. "Somebody said to me the other day, 'Is this the last thing you're going to do?'", says Stritch. "In your dreams! I can't wait to get back into an [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] costume that isn't mine – but [that] will be when the show is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marc Peyser|title=A Stritch in Time|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/63775|work=Newsweek|date=February 11, 2002|accessdate=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Stritch offers a sophisticated gloss on her by now patented, plain-talking woman who reveals all the home truths everyone ever wanted (or didn't) to hear about themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">The '''end-of-the-day betting effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] reflected in the tendency for bettors to take gambles with higher risk and higher reward at the end of their betting session to try to make up for losses. William McGlothlin (1956) and Mukhtar Ali (1977) first discovered this effect after observing the shift in betting patterns at horserace tracks. Mcglothlin and Ali noticed that people are significantly more likely to prefer longshots to conservative bets on the last race of the day. They found that the movement towards longshots, and away from favorites, is so pronounced that some studies show that conservatively betting on the favorite to show (to finish first, second, or third) in the last race is a profitable bet despite the track’s take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=Mukhtar M.|year=1977|title=Probability and utility estimates for racetrack bettors|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=85|number=4|pages=803–815|doi=10.1086/260600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlothlin|first=William H.|year=1956|title=Stability of choices among uncertain alternatives|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=69|number=4|pages=604–615|doi=10.2307/1419083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Expected utility hypothesis]] cannot explain the shift in risk preferences across the day if bettors integrate their wealth because the last race of the day is not fundamentally different from the first. [[Prospect theory]] can explain the shift by assuming people open a mental account at the beginning of the day, close it at the end, and hate closing an account in the red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Choices, Values, and Frames. New York|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|year=2000|page=296|isbn=978-0-521-62749-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end-of-the-day betting effect is consistent with the [[risk aversion]]/[[risk seeking]] behaviors associated with prospect theory, which state that people are more likely to be risk averse in the case of gains and risk seeking in the case of losses. Prospect theory claims that people begin with zero daily profit as a reference point and gamble in the domain of losses to break even. Because the racetrack takes a hefty bite out of each dollar, most people are down money when the last races near. Anything below this target is regarded as a loss and triggers risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to break even. Diminishing sensitivity to successive losses means that the cost of the last bet is relatively trivial compared to what has already been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardman|first=David|title=Judgment and Decision Making. Malden, MA|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|page=70|isbn=978-1-4051-2398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betters refrain from making bets that would not recoup their losses if successful.

==Example==
John and Bob go to the casino to play [[roulette]]. After two hours of playing their wives tell them that they must leave after one more spin. John is up $200. Bob is down $320. The end-of-the-day betting effect says that John is more likely to make a low risk bet, such as betting on red or black (1:1 odds), while Bob is more likely to make a bet that can recoup his losses if he is successful, such as betting $10 on 3 single numbers (35:1 odds each).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">[[File:Zan Zig performing with rabbit and roses, magician poster, 1899-2.jpg|thumb|upright|This 1899 advertising poster for a [[magic (illusion)|magician]] prominently features the hat-trick.]]

The '''hat-trick''' is a classic magic trick where a performer will produce an object (traditionally a [[rabbit]] or a bouquet of flowers) out of an apparently empty [[top hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]]. ''[[Conjuring (book)|Conjuring]]''. {{ISBN|0-312-09771-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

In its simplest form, the trick works by placing the hat on a specially made table or chest. Both the hat, and the surface it is placed on, will have a hidden opening in them, through which an object stored in a compartment in the table or chest can be pulled. Alternatively, the performer can produce an item hidden in their sleeve using [[sleight of hand]] and [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]].  This eliminates the need to place the hat on a surface, and also allows the performer to give the hat to an audience member for inspection. However, producing a rabbit from a hat using nothing but sleight of hand is a much more difficult trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvin|first1=Glenn|title=At 86, James Randi is still amazing|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/08/30/4316916/at-86-james-randi-is-still-amazing.html|work=Miami Herald|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trick is also traditionally performed for children, since it is a basic trick with basic props.

It is said that the earliest magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat was [[Louis Comte]], in 1814,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dhvS5rKAhg0C&amp;dq=%22louis+comte%22+a+rabbit+out+of+a+hat&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22louis+comte%22+ Severn, Bill, ''Bill Severn's Big Book of Magic'', 1980, p. 212.]&lt;/ref&gt; though this is also attributed to the much later [[John Henry Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[QI]], A Series, Episode 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pop culture ==
[[File:Crystal Clear app Startup Wizard.png|thumb|upright|Top hat as an icon for magic]]

This magic trick is so well known that it has been referenced in a wide variety of media.  The top hat used for the trick has become almost synonymous with stage magicians, and is commonly used as an icon to represent magic (such as the example on the right). Likewise, rabbits are so commonly associated with the trick that rabbits are often used to represent magic in general.

'''''I'll Say She Is''''' (1924) is a musical comedy [[revue]] written by brothers [[Will B. Johnstone]] (book and lyrics) and Tom Johnstone (music). It was the Broadway debut of the [[Marx Brothers]] ([[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], [[Chico Marx|Chico]], and [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]]). A revival of ''I'll Say She Is'', as "adapted and expanded" by the writer-performer Noah Diamond, was seen [[Off-Broadway|Off Broadway]] at the Connelly Theater in 2016.

==Background==
''I'll Say She Is'' led to the Marxes' rise out of [[vaudeville]] and into stardom on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]] and later into [[motion pictures]], and came at a time when they had gotten themselves effectively banned from the major vaudeville circuits owing to a dispute with [[Edward Franklin Albee II|E. F. Albee]], and had failed in an attempt to produce their own shows on the alternate [[The Shubert Organization|Shubert]] circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gimme a Thrill: The Story of I'll Say She Is, the Lost Marx Brothers Musical, and How it Was Found|last=Diamond|first=Noah|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2016|isbn=978-1593939335|location=Duncan, OK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show included some Marx Brothers routines and musical specialties from their years in vaudeville, incorporated into a thin narrative about a rich girl looking for thrills, as presented to her by a succession of male suitors. The libretto and lyrics were written by Will B. Johnstone, who later co-wrote the classic Marx Brothers films ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'' (1931) and ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932) with music by his brother, Tom Johnstone. The comedic high point was a long sketch featuring Groucho as [[Napoleon]], which the Brothers regarded as the funniest thing they ever did. After touring for almost a year, the show opened on Broadway on May 19, 1924 at the [[Casino Theatre (New York City)|Casino Theatre]]. It closed on February 7, 1925 after 313 performances.

It was a roaring success, and it catapulted the Marx Brothers to superstardom, accepted by the New York smart set of the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. [[Alexander Woollcott]] and [[Robert Benchley]] were among the theatre critics who made ''I'll Say She Is'' a smash, and George S. Kaufman would co-write their next two Broadway musicals, ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'' (1925) and ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1928). Unlike those shows, however, ''I'll Say She Is'' was never made into a film. A version of its opening scene, however, was made into a short for [[Paramount Pictures]] as part of a feature called ''[[The House That Shadows Built]]'' (1931), made to celebrate Paramount's 20th anniversary of their founding in 1912, and as a promotion for the then-upcoming Marx film ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]''. An animated version of the Napoleon scene (with Groucho voicing himself) was incorporated into an ABC-TV special called ''[[The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians]]'' (1970).

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
;Scene 1 – Theatrical Agency.
The first act begins with a song by the chorus called "Do It".

At its conclusion, the setting changes to the office of a talent agent, wherein [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]] bursts through the door, proclaiming to be a great musical actor. He gives a terrible impression of a popular musical act of the day. (The act being imitated would change over the run of the show. [[Gallagher and Shean]], [[Joe Frisco]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] are a few of its victims.)

Just as the agent is about to kick Zeppo out, [[Chico Marx|Chico]] arrives, also proclaiming to be a great musical talent, and gives an even worse impression of the same musical act. This is followed by [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], who wisecracks his way through his unsolicited audition. Finally, [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] bursts in, who pantomimes his way through his take on the audition.

Another actor arrives, asking for a juvenile part, but he cannot do the impression the Brothers have just butchered. The agent invites him in. He then confides in the would-be actors that he has no jobs for them, but that there's "a wealthy young lady who claims she will give her heart, her hand, and her fortune to the man who gives her the greatest thrill."

He then asks if they recall "the old fable of [[Tinker, Tailor|the Richman, Poorman, Beggarman, Thief, Doctor, Lawyer, Merchant, Chief]]." The agent assigns himself as The Richman, and the rest of the cast will take the other parts, with each pursuing the wealthy young lady under the guise of the assigned role. This meager plot device ties the musical revue together.

;Scene 2 – Art Curtain.
The men arrive at the heiress's residence, much to the chagrin of the butler, who agrees to let them in.

;Scene 3 – Beauty's Reception Room.
The eight gentleman suitors, among them The Four Marx Brothers, enter the reception room of the heiress (known throughout as "The Beauty"). The men, each playing the roles of the aforementioned fable, attempt to woo her, but she states she needs a thrill in life. The Beauty requests that they each draw a number, to decide who gets the first chance to give her that thrill. In so doing, she takes the hand of The Chief, but doesn't let go. The Beauty and The Chief then sing the duet, "Thrill of Love" or "Only You". (The two songs were transposed between Acts I and II at some point during the run of the show.)

;Scene 4 – Art Curtain.
From the drawing of numbers, The Richman draws the number one. But The Thief, being a thief, steals The Beauty and takes her to Chinatown.

;Scene 5 – Chinatown Street.
In Chinatown, The Thief shows The Beauty all sorts of insidious thrills: terror, gunshots, and murder.

;Scene 6 – The Opium Den.
The Thief then takes The Beauty to an opium den. The Beauty says that she'll "try anything once," and smokes opium. She falls asleep, which is followed by a "Chinese Apache Dance" number. At the end of the dance, one of the dancers falls dead.

;Scene 7 – The Dream Ship.
An actor playing the role of a "Chinaman" sings "San Toy" and carries the dead dancer offstage. This is followed by a "dream ship" dance sequence. The Beauty awakes, with the Thief re-entering the scene, along with Groucho and a policeman. Groucho tells the policeman to arrest The Beauty, due to the death that has taken place.

:'''Groucho:''' ''You are going to be convicted of murder.''

:'''Beauty:''' ''What makes you so confident?''

:'''Groucho:''' ''I'm going to be your lawyer.''

;Scene 8 – The Court Room.
The Beauty enters the courtroom, accused of murder. Harpo enters as the judge. Chico enters as the defense lawyer, but is mainly interested in playing cards with Harpo.

Groucho enters as the district attorney, to try to convict The Beauty of murder. He accuses her of stabbing the "Chinaman" with a revolver, but she proclaims innocence, and counterattacks by telling the Brothers that after they left her reception room earlier, all her silverware had gone missing.

A Detective then enters to inquire about three suits that were stolen from the judge's chambers. He quickly finds a plethora of stolen property on both Groucho and Chico. He then shakes Harpo's hand, wondering why an honest man keeps such bad company. While shaking his hand, the silverware stolen from The Beauty falls out of Harpo's coat, piece by piece.

;Scene 9 – Art Curtain.
The Beauty and The Chief appear before the curtain and make plans to meet later, after The Beauty has sought out more thrills.

;Scene 10 – 'Rainy Day'.
Chorus members sing "Rainy Day".

;Scene 11 – Art Curtain.
Another song follows: a solo for one of the female chorus members called "Wall Street Blues".

;Scene 12 – Wall Street.
The Beauty meets the Richman on Wall Street. The Beauty watches as The Richman invests in stock, and, also, takes a turn at gambling. Thinking that this may be the thrill she's seeking, The Beauty tries her hand at gambling as well, and eventually, The Richman tells her the biggest gamblers play the stock market.

;Scene 13 – Wall Street Plaything.
At the conclusion of the Wall Street sequence, which ends the first act, an elaborate costumed ballet performs a dance interpretation of gambling. Photographs from the performance show dancers dressed as dice, coins, a roulette wheel, and a gold statue, not unlike the extravagant [[Busby Berkeley]] dance numbers seen in 1930s film.

===Act II===
;Scene 1 – Art Curtain.
The second act opens with an unknown song by The Melvin Sisters.

;Scene 2 – The Inception of Drapery.
Zeppo takes his turn to woo The Beauty. He does so by giving her the thrill of clothing and jewels from foreign lands, each carried onstage by a chorus girl, with The Beauty trying on a plethora of the risque garments. This does nothing to thrill The Beauty, and Zeppo walks off, telling her:
 
:'''Zeppo:''' ''It's the Beggarman's chance now. He will give you the thrill of Cinderella backwards. He will take you from riches to poverty. Good-Night!''

;Scene 3 – Cinderella Backwards.
Groucho, dressed in a tutu and long underwear and smoking a pipe, enters from behind the curtain—an intentionally bad Fairy Godmother impersonation. The Beauty tells Groucho that she wants to experience the thrill of being poor, having been rich all her life. She then asks for him to take her to her Prince Charming, but Groucho refuses, since he has other Cinderellas he has to look after. He promises to be back at midnight, so The Beauty decides to call her Rolls Royce. Groucho tells her no, if she wants to experience being poor. She'll have to walk.

:'''Groucho:''' ''No Rolls Royce, no taxi, no street car, no roller skates, not even a Chevrolet, you'll walk!''

:'''Beauty:''' ''Marvellous, it's the first time in all my life I've ever walked!''

:'''Groucho:''' ''Ah, then you have never been automobile riding?''

;Scene 4 – Hawaiian Scene.
In early performances, a dance quartet performed a "marathon dance number" at this point in the revue. On Broadway, this was replaced by a Hawaiian dance featuring "Sixteen Yankee Girls".

;Scene 5 – Art Curtain.
The Chief and The Beauty meet at a marble fountain, with The Beauty wondering if The Chief is still pursuing her. They then sing "Thrill of Love" or "Only You". (The two songs were transposed between Acts I and II at some point during the run of the show.)

;Scene 6 – The Marble Fountain.
A ballet of dancers portraying living statues performs a sequence called "The Awakening of Love". Groucho, Harpo, and Zeppo then parody this dance with their own dance number, referred to as "The Death of Love".

;Scene 7 – The Hypnotist.
Chico claims to be a hypnotist, telling The Richman that he has just hypnotized The Beauty and she now thinks she is Josephine, wife of Napoleon. He then attempts to hypnotize The Richman himself with mixed results.

:'''Chico:''' ''...You are a cat.''

:'''Richman:''' ''Meow!''

:'''Chico:''' ''You are a dog!''

:'''Richman:''' ''Meow, - - - Woof! Woof!''

:'''Chico:''' ''You are a snake.''

:'''Richman:''' ''How do you "snake"?''

:'''Chico:''' ''Just like a worm, only more.''
:  (Richman tries to wriggle like a snake)
:''...What a fat snake.''

:'''Richman:''' ''Yes, but I don't think I am a snake.''

:'''Chico:''' ''You don't, but I will give a thousand dollars to anyone who can prove that I don't think you are a snake.''

;Scene 8 – Napoleon's First Waterloo.
The Beauty enters as Josephine followed by Groucho as Napoleon. He calls for his faithful advisors—Francois, Alphonse, and Gaston—played by Chico, Zeppo, and Harpo, respectively. They appear, and they can barely hide their infatuation with The Beauty. Harpo makes no attempt to do so, ignoring Groucho's introduction altogether.

Groucho questions The Beauty's love for him, but she doesn't understand. He leaves several times to go off to war, always coming back to say goodbye once more, or to fetch the sword he keeps forgetting. Each time he leaves, the other Brothers attempt to violently woo The Beauty, with Groucho alternately suspicious and oblivious to his advisors' advances to his wife. This becomes increasingly difficult for The Beauty to hide, as Harpo leaves his harp behind, and Chico, under cover, begins to sneeze. Eventually, Groucho discovers what is going on. The Beauty is afraid that Groucho will kill her, but he says he won't. Instead, he is going to sell the couch, which The Beauty finds even more upsetting than killing her.

;Scene 9 – Finale.
The revue closes with another song and dance number, which changed over the life of the show. During its Broadway run, the song performed was called "A Bit of Tango Jazz".

The eight gentleman suitors then enter with The Beauty. The Beauty tells them that the contest is over. She has found the greatest thrill in life, and that thrill is love. And she has found the thrill of love with The Chief.

==Performances and aftermath==
The show debuted at the [[Allentown Symphony Hall|Lyric Theatre]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name="whowho"&gt;{{Citation |last = Kohl | first = John Y. |title='Who's Who' Of Show Business Played The Orpheum In Allentown.| newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=E.01 | date=April 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; before opening in nearby [[Philadelphia]] in May 1923. It opened at the [[Casino Theatre (New York, New York)|Casino Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on May 19, 1924.  Legend has it that the first-string critics for the New York papers were slated to see a different show premiering at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] the same night, and only came to ''I'll Say She Is'' when the other show was postponed at the last moment. However, as both the Winter Garden and the Casino were part of the Shubert chain, it seems more likely that the openings were deliberately set for different dates to avoid competing with each other.  In any case, the critics, notably [[Alexander Woollcott]], who was only at the show because his other engagements were canceled,&lt;ref&gt;''Life with Groucho'', Arthur Marx, Popular Library Edition, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; raved about the show, especially Harpo's performance, and the Marx Brothers became first-rank stars virtually overnight.

Despite the fact that the Marx Brothers were the stars of this show, because it was a [[revue]], they are absent from significant parts of the performance. They are almost entirely absent from the musical numbers and do not appear at all in several scenes. Because of this, much of the material that they performed in ''I'll Say She Is'' exists in one form or another. The opening "Theatrical Agency" scene was later filmed for the [[Paramount Pictures]] release ''[[The House That Shadows Built]]'' almost in its entirety. Instead of [[Gallagher and Shean]] or [[Joe Frisco]], they impersonate [[Maurice Chevalier]] in the filmed performance.

The penultimate Napoleon scene was filmed as a cartoon in 1970 by [[Rankin-Bass]] in their 30-minute television production ''[[The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians]]''. Groucho performed his own voice for this recreation. Harpo and Chico had both died by then, so Chico's part was performed by [[Paul Frees]], while Harpo's part, having no spoken lines, was replaced by sound effects. Reportedly, Groucho was impressed by the accuracy of Frees's performance as Chico.

The Marx Brothers' last Paramount film, ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', contains a courtroom scene largely inspired by the one in ''I'll Say She Is'', although there are significant differences. The silverware gag in this scene was recycled for the stage performance of ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'' and is also featured in [[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|the film of the same name]].

This is also the last production by The Marx Brothers in which they were billed under their given names. Harpo was billed as Adolph Arthur, Zeppo as Herbert, Groucho as Julius Henry, and Chico as Leonard. In his autobiography ''[[Harpo Marx|Harpo Speaks]]'' (1961), Harpo wrote that theatre critic Alexander Woollcott encouraged the Brothers to use their stage names in any subsequent production, which they did, starting with their next Broadway show, ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'' (1925), which was later turned into [[The Cocoanuts|a film version in 1929]].

Having toiled on the [[Vaudeville|Vaudeville circuit]] for nearly a quarter century, this would be the last stage performance that The Marx Brothers would perform for Vaudeville theaters. Once ''I'll Say She Is'' hit Broadway, they never left. They would have two further Broadway hits, ''The Cocoanuts'' and ''Animal Crackers'', which were then filmed in the early years of [[sound film|talking pictures]] as their first two feature films. With the closing of ''Animal Crackers'', their third and final Broadway show, the Marx Brothers moved to Hollywood, and enjoyed long careers in film and television.

==Adaptation and 2016 Off-Broadway Revival==
In 2009, writer and performer Noah Diamond began to research and restore ''I'll Say She Is'', working from Johnstone's 30-page rehearsal typescript and numerous other sources to reconstruct the show. In May 2014, coinciding with the ninetieth anniversary of the show's Broadway opening, ''I'll Say She Is'' received two staged readings, in a new "reconstruction" and adaptation by Diamond, who had by then spent five years researching and expanding the work.&lt;ref&gt;http://willmckinley.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/90-years-later-lost-marx-brothers-musical-is-reborn/&lt;/ref&gt; A fuller staging was seen in August 2014 at the [[New York International Fringe Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/marx-set-fringe-takes-stage-article-1.1894675&lt;/ref&gt; featuring Melody Jane as Beauty, Noah Diamond as Groucho, Seth Shelden as Harpo, Robert Pinnock as Chico, Aristotle Stamat as Zeppo, and Kathy Biehl as Ruby. Both the Marxfest readings and the Fringe productions were co-produced and directed by [[Trav S.D.]]

A full [[Off-Broadway|Off Broadway]] production opened at the Connelly Theater in June 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://stagebuddy.com/theater/theater-articles/trav-sd-interview/&lt;/ref&gt; running for 3 previews and 23 performances. Directed by Amanda Sisk, it was well received by the New York press, receiving critic's pick from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/theater/review-ill-say-she-is-revives-a-marx-brothers-revue.html&lt;/ref&gt; and lauded by [[Adam Gopnik]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-a-lost-marx-brothers-musical-found-its-way-back-onstage&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond and Shelden reprised their roles as Groucho and Harpo respectively, the British comedian [[Matt Roper]] played Chico, actor [[Matt Walters]] portrayed Zeppo, while [[Sabrina Chap]] arranged the score and worked as musical director and bandleader. A short film featuring interviews and cast rehearsals was featured in the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/back-on-stage-a-lost-marx-brothers-musical-1464275103&lt;/ref&gt;

Having observed a rehearsal session of the famed 'Napoleon' sketch at New York's Pearl Studios, Gopnik wrote in the New Yorker:

"One sees at once why the Napoleon scene became legendary overnight—apart from still being extremely funny, it has the edge of randomness, the pure absurdity, that made the Marx Brothers seem, on that opening night as ever after, so ''modern''. Of the great movie comedians, [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] is rooted in Dickens and the nineteenth-century stage; [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]], more cinematic, in a kind of melancholic Civil War stoicism. Only the Marxes seem contemporary with [[Dada]]. There is no logic or pathos or point or even much structure to it—the fourth wall is broken, then restored, and then broken again. Napoleon’s appearances and reappearances from the Russian front are as arbitrary as a Magritte drawing—and the scene’s moral, to the degree that it has one, is the nihilistic one that runs true in comedy from [[Aristophanes]] to [[Sid Caesar]]: all authority is always ridiculous, and man (and woman) runs by appetite alone. All of [[Monty Python]]’s non sequiturs and sudden stoppages—“the sketch is now over”—begin here, as does most of the pure burlesque aggression of a [[Mel Brooks]], whose historical kidding, as in the “2000 Year Old Man” skits, starts here, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-a-lost-marx-brothers-musical-found-its-way-back-onstage|title=How a Lost Marx Brothers Musical Found Its Way Back Onstage|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book ''Gimme a Thrill: The Story of I'll Say She Is, the Lost Marx Brothers Musical, and How it Was Found'' was published by BearManor Media in 2016.

'''Independent News Co.''' was a [[magazine]] and [[comic book]] [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] business owned by [[National Periodical Publications]], the parent company of [[DC Comics]]. Independent News distributed all DC publications, as well as those of a few rival publishers, such as [[Marvel Comics]] from 1957 to 1969, in addition to [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] and popular magazines. The company was founded in 1932 and operated until c. 1970.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1929, as a favor to an old client, pulp magazine publisher [[Harry Donenfeld]] gave work to the client's son, [[Jack Liebowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard, ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-465-03656-1}}, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Donenfeld and Liebowitz had little in common, but Liebowitz soon emerged as a man who could run finances.&lt;ref name="Gerard89"&gt;Jones, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Donenfeld would promise the world to clients without understanding the economic realities, Liebowitz was bookish and ensured bills were paid on time and helped create a respectability in the firm. Soon the two men were spoken of as a partnership.

When Liebowitz first worked for Donenfeld, the latter's empire was little more than a publishing house for "sex pulp" and art nudie magazines distributed by [[Eastern News]], a company run by Charles Dreyfus and [[Paul Sampliner]]. In 1931, Eastern News faced [[bankruptcy]] and could no longer pay its publishers; the company owed Donenfeld alone $30,000. A compromise was called for, and Donenfeld, not wanting to find himself hamstrung by a distributor again, approached Sampliner with the idea of creating the '''Independent News Company''', a publishing house with its own distribution system.&lt;ref name="Gerard88-89"&gt;Jones, pg 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Sampliner running the distribution end,&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt; Donenfeld as salesman, Harry's youngest brother Irving (not to be mistaken for Harry's son: [[Irwin Donenfeld]] &lt;ref&gt;Alter Ego #26, pg 53. Irwin Donenfeld says: "I was the only Irwin. My uncle Irving..."&lt;/ref&gt;) as head printer, and Liebowitz running the finances, they launched Independent News in 1932.&lt;ref name="Gerard89-92"&gt;Jones, pp. 89–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Donenfeld brothers had begun as printers, and they continued printing the company's magazine and comic book covers even after branching into distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=INDEPENDENT+NEWS Independent News entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now Donenfeld was a distributor as well as a publisher, and was now no longer reliant on others to run his business. As a publisher, Donenfeld had managed to dodge creditors and break deals, but as a distributor, he came to rely more on Liebowitz to ensure that the company ran smoothly. Liebowitz ensured bills were paid on time and began to build a trust with clients that Donenfeld's enterprises had never experienced.&lt;ref name="Gerard92"&gt;Jones, pg 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
In 1935, writer/entrepreneur [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]] approached Independent News in a bid to relaunch his comic book ''[[More Fun Comics|New Fun]]'', having lost his previous backers due to poor sales and debts. Donenfeld accepted to distribute the comic but with heavy loss of rights to Wheeler-Nicholson. Wheeler-Nicholson produced two more titles to be handled by Independent News, ''New Comics'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' (which would later see the first appearance of [[Batman]]), now under the banner of '''Detective Comics Incorporated''', in which Wheeler-Nicholson was forced to take Donenfeld and Liebowitz as partners. In 1938, Donenfeld sued Wheeler-Nicholson for nonpayment and Detective Comics Inc. went into bankruptcy. Not too surprisingly Donenfeld bought up the company and Wheeler-Nicholson's [[National Allied Publications]] in their entirety as part of the action.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 101–102, 107–108, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth publication under National Allied Publications would be ''[[Action Comics]]'' (1938). Issue #1 introduced the superhero, [[Superman]], created by artist [[Joe Shuster]] and writer [[Jerry Siegel]], and the character's popularity created incredible profits; not only in comic book sales, but also in merchandising such as toys, costumes and even a [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|radio show]]. At the end of 1941 Donenfeld's comic businesses took in $2.6 million.&lt;ref name="Gerard142"&gt;Jones, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Gaines]], future founder of [[EC Comics]], formed [[All-American Publications]] in 1938 after successfully seeking funding from Harry Donenfeld.,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Gerard Jones]] writes of Donenfeld's investment:
{{blockquote|Harry had agreed on one condition: that [Gaines] take [Detective Comics partner] Jack Liebowitz on as his partner. ... Jack would be tempted to leave and form a competing company if there was nothing to hold him. And it may well have been a way for Harry to keep Gaines under control; since Jack was still drawing a salary and significant bonuses from Detective Comics and [self-distributorship] Independent News, he wouldn't let Gaines take off on his own or act against the interests of the other companies. ... Gaines became the principal and Jack Liebowitz the minority owner of All-American [Publications].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1946, Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, keeping only ''Picture Stories from the Bible'' as the foundation of his own new company, [[EC Comics]]. "Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics.... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, Independent News, and their affiliated firms into  a single corporate entity, '''National Periodical Publications'''".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consolidation ===
The biggest magazine distribution company of this era was [[American News Company]], which had a virtual [[monopoly]] on all comics except DC's. From 1952 to 1957 [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] distributed his company's comics to newsstands through his self-owned distributor, Atlas. He then switched to American News — which shortly afterward lost a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] [[lawsuit]] and discontinued its business.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to its biggest rival, [[DC Comics|National (DC) Comics]]. As then-Atlas editor [[Stan Lee]] recalled in a 1988 interview:
{{quote|text=... [We had been] turning out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and ... suddenly we went ... to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News Distributors would accept from us.&lt;ref name="Stan and Roy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |title=Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas |work=[[Comic Book Artist]] |issue=2 |date=Summer 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lHwfKOI2?url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |archivedate=November 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[American Comics Group]], another comic book publisher from the era (also with ties to Harry Donenfeld), was distributed by Independent News, as were such popular magazines as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Family Circle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke, Jon B. "Donenfeld's Comics: A Talk with Irwin Donenfeld, 1960s DC Editorial Director," Comic Book Artist Collection, vol. 2. (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2002), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Liebowitz]] stayed with Independent News until 1965, eventually becoming a co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=LIEBOWITZ%2c+JACK Liebowitz entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irwin Donenfeld]], who was DC's editorial director in the 1960s, was also a vice president of Independent News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=DONENFELD%2c+IRWIN Donenfeld entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale and demise ===
In 1967, National Periodical Publications (including Independent News) was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]], which later purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] and became [[Warner Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm "DC Comics,"] Don Markstein's Toonopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The Donenfelds and their "crew" were out, and new management came in. By 1970, Independent News was defunct, absorbed into a larger and changing distribution business. Independent News' last president was [[Harold Chamberlin]], who served from 1968-1970. Chamblerin went on to become president of Warner Publishing from 1970–1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=CHAMBERLIN%2c+HAROLD Chamberlin entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[List of assets owned by Time Warner|Warner Publishing Services]], the company was named by DC Comics as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Warner Publishing Services Fifty Years of Distributing Comics| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 12| panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inside U.S.A.''''' is a musical [[revue]] by [[Arthur Schwartz]] (music) and [[Howard Dietz]] (lyrics). It was loosely based on the book ''[[Inside U.S.A. (book)|Inside U.S.A.]]'' by [[John Gunther]]. Sketches were written by [[Arnold M. Auerbach]], [[Moss Hart]], and Arnold B. Horwitt.

==Production==
The revue opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[New Century Theatre]] on April 30, 1948, transferred to the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] on September 23, 1948, and closed on February 19, 1949 after a total of 399 performances.&lt;ref name=vault&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/6185/Inside-USA ''Inside U.S.A.''], playbillvault.com, accessed May 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketches were directed by Robert H. Gordon, dances and Musical numbers were staged by [[Helen Tamiris]], the production design was by [[Lemuel Ayers]], costume design was by Eleanor Goldsmith, Beatrice Lillie's costumes and gowns were by Castillo and mask design was by John Robert Lloyd.  The cast included [[Jack Haley]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[Valerie Bettis]], [[Talley Beatty]], [[Jack Cassidy]], [[John Tyers]], [[Jane Lawrence]], [[Carl Reiner]], and Nellie Hill.&lt;ref name=vault/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The revue consists of a number of sketches related only in that they generally focus on a particular State. The opening is a serenade to the United States by the company ("Inside USA"). Lillie provides a "mocking madrigal" that praises the industry in Pittsburgh ("Come, Oh Come to Pittsburgh"). A woman loses her boyfriend to the horses at [[Churchill Downs]] ("Blue Grass"). In one sketch, a superstitious maid unnerves an actress on a Broadway opening night, using a [[ouija]] board and numerology (written  by Moss Hart). New Orleans is featured in "At The Mardi Gras", with Lillie as the Queen. Wisconsin is featured in "First Prize At The Fair." Lillie and Haley, costumed as New Mexico Indians, declare "We Won't Take It Back." The romantic "Rhode Island Is Famous For You" turns into a ragtime number and names the most famous products of various states. In the Western number "My Gal Is Mine Once More" a cowboy celebrates remarriage to his first wife.
Haley teaches apprentice waiters to make dining customers unhappy. Lillie is the "priggish, unimaginative leader of a choral society" and a mermaid with a strange romantic life.  [[Herb Shriner]], without harmonica, provides a wry Western themed monologue as "A Feller from Indiana."&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Brooks. "At The Theatre", ''The New York Times'', May 1, 1948, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Frank, Hackman, Florence, McNeilly, Donald.

The biggest success from the musical was ''Haunted Heart'',&lt;ref&gt;Dan Dietz Off Broadway Musicals, 1910-2007: Casts, Credits, Songs,   2010 "most enduring standard, the ethereal “Haunted Heart.” Over a halfcentury later, the ballad is still popular: It was the theme song for the 1999 film The End of the Affair, and it was the title of opera singer Renee Fleming's CD collection of popular ..."&lt;/ref&gt; with which [[Perry Como]] and [[Jo Stafford]] had hit recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=w133298|pure_url=yes}} "Inside U.S.A. / The Band Wagon" recording listing], allmusic.com, accessed August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the title track of an [[Haunted Heart (Renée Fleming album)|2005 album by Renee Fleming]].

[[Blossom Dearie]] recorded "Rhode Island is Famous For You."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig2daWp-Pls&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Reviews were favorable from [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' ("keen and impeccable") and Robert Coleman of the ''Daily Mirror'' ("a handsome hit").  However, the only song that became a hit was ''Haunted Heart''. A strike by [[ASCAP]] delayed the recording and radio play from the show, which may have been the reason for the lack of more hit songs.&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbertson, Ken. ''Inside:The Biography of John Gunther'' (2002), E-Reads Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7592-3288-1}}, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Time Magazine'' reviewer wrote that the revue was the "least enjoyable Bea Lillie show in a long time. Not that it is really bad or botched: it is all thoroughly professional. It is also thoroughly unoriginal and unexhilarating; it not only fails to shed light of its own, but even dims the cherished Lillie luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804680,00.html "The Theater: New Revue in Manhattan, May 10, 1948",]''Time Magazine'', May 10, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
*1948 Theatre World Award
:Valerie Bettis (winner)
:Estelle Loring (winner)

==Television==
A television show titled '''''Inside U.S.A. With Chevrolet''''', was based on this revue, with music, comedy, and dance that showed different states. The TV show aired on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] network from September 29, 1949 through March 16, 1950, with Schwartz and Dietz providing original music and [[Peter Lind Hayes]] the Master of Ceremonies, with name guest stars. [[Margaret O'Brien]] was the first guest and [[Joan Blondell]] the last, with [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Ethel Merman]] also guesting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/inside-u.s.a.-with-chevrolet/show/5612/summary.html ''Inside U.S.A. with Chevrolet''] tv.com, accessed August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
''Inside U.S.A.'''s original cast recording was recorded before the production was fully cast in order to beat the 1948 ASCAP strike. The 1948 musical revue 'Inside U.S.A.'  was commemorated with a 78 rpm album consisting of four records released by RCA Victor Records featuring the show's principals, Beatrice Lillie  and Jack Haley, as well as performances by non-cast member Billy Williams and Perry Como's hit recording of "Haunted Heart." Russ Cass and his Orchestra provided the music.

'''Jaiva''', or '''township jive''' ('''TJ'''), is a [[Music genre|subgenre]] of South African township music and [[African dance]] form&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Y58CjwsXs |title=Jaiva |publisher=YouTube |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xykC1IP6odU|Tina and Mvuyisi jiving at the Ikamva Lethu centre in Kayamandi South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; that influenced Western breakdance&lt;ref&gt;band=Wozani |title= Township Jive |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-pdj9oC_5s&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged from the [[shebeen]] culture of the apartheid-era [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].

==Influences and particularity==

While closely associated with [[mbaqanga]], Township Jive more broadly incorporates influences from mariba and kwaito,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghananaija.com/movies/index.php?option=com_hwdvideoshare&amp;task=viewvideo&amp;Itemid=53&amp;video_id=3823 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is synonymous with none of these. To the extent that mariba influences TJ, it may be somewhat sanitised as TJ broke into the international commercial arena.&lt;ref name="Garland Encyclopedia of Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Ruth|title=Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Garland Pub.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in world music circles==
[[The Boyoyo Boys]] received additional press coverage when [[Malcolm McLaren]] allegedly plagiarised their song "Puleng" and released it as the hit "[[Double Dutch (song)|Double Dutch]]", capitalising on the emergence of [[breakdance]] and [[hip-hop]].&lt;ref name="magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com"&gt;Ambrose Ehirim|Sunday, 9 December 2007|The Boyoyo Boys and Township Jive Today |http://magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com/ambrose-ehirim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional momentum for [[world beat]] attention to South African music developed as a result of international attention to the demise of [[apartheid]] and Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert in Wembley Stadium, London in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==History==

According to Ambrose Ehirim, a US-based Nigeria specialist,&lt;ref name="magazine.biafranigeriaworld.com"/&gt; township music dates to the 1950s when it was proscribed by South African police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehirim |first=Ambrose |url=http://samakamusic.blogspot.com/2007/12/boyoyo-boys-and-township-jive-today.html |title=Amazano Music: The Boyoyo Boys and Township Jive Today |publisher=Samakamusic.blogspot.com |date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been contradicted by anti-apartheid activist/musician [[Johnny Clegg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Johnny+Clegg |title=Johnny Clegg |publisher=Everything2.com |date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has claimed that "by the 1960s, the development of umbaqanga hadn't even really started". Mbaqanga (or Umbaquanga) has been characterised as urban pop music "with high-pitched, choppy guitar and a powerful bass line" influenced by "funk, reggae, American R&amp;B, soul and drawing on South African Marabi, gospel music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com |title=Everything2 |publisher=Everything2 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws on both kweli and maribi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/user/StrawberryFrog/writeups/mbaqanga |title=mbaqanga (thing) by StrawberryFrog |publisher=Everything2.com |date=9 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Township Jive is closely associated with the development of mbaqanga but is more closely associated with emergent international trends and not as insular and rooted in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Meintjes (1996). Review of Christopher Ballantine 'Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville', ''Popular Music'', 15, pp 245–247 {{doi|10.1017/S0261143000008187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Ballantine traces the "shift from imitating American jazz to localizing the sound with African features. This he connects to the emergence of the ideology of New Africanism".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ballantine|Christopher Ballantine 'Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville|xxxx|xxxx&lt;/ref&gt; While the international market was absorbing Township Jive under the swirl of commercial activity culminating in the McLaren copyright infringement lawsuit, the subsequent release of BBoys' new album was preferred by a more elite audience closely associated with the black diaspora consciousness movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Louise Meintjesa1 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2646784&amp;fulltextType=BR&amp;fileId=S0261143000008187 |title=Cambridge Journals Online – Popular Music – Abstract – Marabi Nights: Early South African Jazz and Vaudeville. By Christopher Ballantine. Johannesburg: Raven Press, 1993. xii + 116 pp., taped examples |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
The homogenisation of Township Jive with US and UK culture, due to [[globalisation]], is viewed by African artists as a threat to the preservation of their local tradition and credibility. Thus, artists focus on maintaining an emotional link between customer and brand. This explains why transnational corporations are much less interested in homogenising or Americanizing kwaito music because true kwaito represents and dictates South African experience.&lt;ref&gt;Magubane, Zine. The Vinyl Aint Final "Globalization and Gangster Rap: Hip Hop in the post-Apartheid City". 220&lt;/ref&gt; Americanizing kwaito, as is many artists' opinion, can potentially dilute the substance kwaito was originally based on.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Sharlene. "Is Kwaito South African Hip Hop? Why the answer matters and who it matters to". May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On the upside, critical awareness of TJ has enhanced appreciation of fusion artists and others influenced by its style. For instance, Vibration Bookings bills its artist Nomfusi as a proponent of "a new style where South African Township Jive ("Jaiva") meets Motown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vibrationbooking.com/nomfusi.html |title=Nomfusi, Manou Gallo, Ernestine Deane, Layori, Batucada Sound Machine – Delicioustunes booking- concerts- management |publisher=Vibrationbooking.com |date= |access-date=1 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202222435/http://www.vibrationbooking.com/nomfusi.html# |archive-date=2 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Boyoyo Boys have, subsequent to the copyright scandal, signed by [[Rounder Records]] which released ''TJ Today'' in 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8809">'''Juste Debout''' ("just standing") is an international and annual [[competitive dance|dance competition]] founded in 2001 by [[Bruce Ykanji]] in France which focuses on [[street dance]] styles. The four main categories are [[hip hop dance#New school/new style|hip hop new style]], [[house (dance)|house]], [[locking (dance)|locking]] and [[popping (dance)|popping]].

==History==
[[File:Juste Debout Scandinavia 2008.JPG|thumb|Semifinal Juste debout Scandinavia 2008.]]
Juste Debout was initially held in 2002 in [[Paris]], France, and has since then returned each year around February. The 2006 edition was the first to feature a number of linked events (so called ''pre-selections'') in countries outside France with the finals being held in Paris. This allowed Juste Debout to reach a larger and more international audience.

Juste Debout 2007 was held on February 25 in Paris and featured international pre-selections starting as early as January in countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan, [[Czech Republic]], Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juste-debout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1863|title=Juste Debout Event|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jsmooth &amp; Future from the dance [[crew]] MGF (Machine Gone Funk) in the United States won the Juste Debout [[Popping]] contest 2007. Manu &amp; loïc from France won the [[Locking (dance)|Locking]]. [[Stephanie Nguyen|Stéphanie]] &amp; Dedson from Denmark and France won Hip-hop. Lastly, Hiro &amp; Meech from Japan and France won the [[House dance]] contest.

Juste Debout 2009 was held on March 1 in the Bercy stadium in Paris. Kite &amp; Fishboy (Former Action), won a close fought, all-Japanese final with previous years winners Kei &amp; Gucchon (Co-Thkoo). Dy &amp; Steve won the Hip-hop against crowd's favourite Maika (10 y.o) &amp; Kazane (12 y.o).

==Program==
The main events of Juste Debout consists of two on two [[battle (dance)|battles]] in which two dancers work as a team trying to outperform the opposite couple in a specific dance style category. The music is chosen by the Juste Debout [[DJ]]s and the dancers are not told of the songs in advance.

Normally, only one person dances at a time and the two teams take turns showing off. A battle finishes when each dancer has performed two times, resulting in a total of eight rounds, usually around a minute long each. Sometimes a team chooses to spontaneously replace or extend one of their rounds with a [[choreography|choreographed]] routine performed together for added effect, which is allowed. After each battle, a group of four judges decides the winning team, which moves them closer to the finals. In the end, a winning couple is chosen for each of the four dance style categories.

Outside of battles, the Juste Debout events often include a number of shows from both the judges and invited guests, as well as dance parties that are open for all to join.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14398">[[Image:Karagiozis.png|thumb|right|Karaghiozis (toy shadow puppet)]]

'''Karagiozis''' or '''Karaghiozis''' ({{lang-ell|Καραγκιόζης}}, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; ''Karagöz'') is a [[shadow puppet]] and [[fictional character]] of [[greek history|Greek]] [[folklore]], originating in the [[Turkish history|Turkish]] [[shadow play]] [[Karagöz and Hacivat]]. He is the main character of the tales narrated in the Turkish and Greek shadow-puppet theatre.

==Origins==
{{see also|Shadow theatre|}}
Shadow theatre, with a single puppeteer creating voices for a dialogue, narrating a story, and possibly even singing while manipulating puppets, appears to come ultimately from the [[Indonesia]]n [[wayang kulit]] or Chinese ''pi ying xi'' [[Shadow play]].

The name Karagiozis or Karaghiozis is from [[Greek language|Greek]] Καραγκιόζης, borrowed from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] Karagöz 'dark eye'.

There are several stories of how shadow theater was established in Asia Minor. Many argue for a Mediterranean origin in the Egyptian shadow puppet tradition.  Whatever the case, it is worthwhile to mention that regardless of religious restrictions, shadow theater became more widespread around the 16th century among the Muslim Turks.

Originally, his popular appeal was his scatological language and protruding phallus. It is still performed in [[Turkey]], especially during [[Ramadan]] celebrations, under the same name. 

Karagiozis seems to have come to mainland [[Greece]], probably from [[Asia Minor]] ([[Anatolia]]) at the 19th century, during Ottoman rule. Karagiozis was hellenized in [[Patras]], [[Greece]] in the end of 19th century by [[Dimitrios Sardounis]] alias ''Mimaros'', who is considered the founder of modern Greek shadow theater.

The genre became a fully integrated, though adapted, amongst the Greek population. But there are several legends as well as studies surrounding Karagiozis's arrival and subsequent popularity in Greece.  Some stories say that Greek merchants brought the art from China and others say that it was a Greek who created the "legend" during Ottoman rule for the entertainment of the sultan.  Yet others believe that it originated from real events involving two masonry workers named [[Karagöz and Hacivat|Karagöz and Haci Ivat]] working in the construction of a mosque in the city of Bursa, Turkey in early 14th century.

==Scenario==
Karagiozis is a poor hunchbacked Greek, his right hand is always depicted long, his clothes are ragged and patched, and his feet are always bare. He lives in a poor [[cottage]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: παράγκα) with his wife Aglaia and his three sons, during the times of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The scene is occupied by his cottage in the left, and the Sultan's Palace ([[Sarayi]]) on the far right. 

Because of his poverty, Karagiozis uses [[trickster|mischievous and crude ways]] to find money and feed his family.

Students of folklore divide Karagiozis' tales in two major categories: the 'Heroics' and the 'Comedies'. The Heroics are tales based on tradition or real stories involving the times under [[Ottoman rule]], and Karagiozis is presented as a helper and assistant of an important hero.

Puppeteers devise their own original tales, however there are many 'traditional' tales that have descended orally from earlier puppeteers and are accepted as 'canon' with slight alterations between the players. Most of them are formulaic and have the following layout (but with a wide improvisational variety), and often involving interaction with the audience:

#Karagiozis appears in the scene with his 3 sons dancing and singing. He welcomes the audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://farses.poulametrela.com/arxeia52/karagiozis.mp3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128062713/http://www.farses.poulametrela.com/arxeia52/karagiozis.mp3 |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a comical dialogue with his children. He then announces the title of the episode and enters his cottage
#The Vizier or a local Ottoman lord meets Hadjiavatis and reports that he has a problem and needs someone to perform a deed
#Hadjiavatis obeys and starts announcing the news (usually a singing sequence) until Karagiozis hears about it
#Initially annoyed by Hadjiavatis' shouting, he finds it's an opportunity to gain money (either by helping the Vizier or not) and sometimes asks Hadjiavatis to aid him.
#Karagiozis either attempts to help the Vizier or fool him. The regular characters (see below) appear one at a time in the scene (they often appear with an introducing song which is standard for each of them); Karagiozis has a funny dialogue with them, mocks them, fools them, or becomes annoyed and ousts them violently.
#Finally, Karagiozis is either rewarded by the Vizier or his mischief is revealed and he's punished - usually by the Vizier's bodyguard, Veligekas.
#At the end Hadjiavatis appears on the screen and together with Karagiozis they announce the end of the show

Some of the most known tales are:
*Alexander the Great and the accursed snake
*Karagiozis the doctor&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kaggelaris, Ν. (2013), ''Βασίλη Κωνσταντόπουλου Στοιχεία Λαϊκού πολιτισμού μέσα από την αφήγησή του'', Athens, Βιβλιοεπιλογή, 71- 87 [https://www.academia.edu/4559984/%CE%92%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%BB%CE%B7_%CE%9A%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%A3%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B9%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1_%CE%9B%CE%B1%CF%8A%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%8D_%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%8D_%CE%BC%CE%AD%CF%83%CE%B1_%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C_%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%B3%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%AE_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Karagiozis the cook
*Karagiozis the senator
*Karagiozis the scholar
*Karagiozis the doctor
*Karagiozis the fisherman
*Karagiozis and the gorilla
*Karagiozis and the ghost

== The characters ==

*'''Karagiozis''', is a [[trickster]] poor Greek man whose sole interest is sleep and eating. Socially, he is in closer relation to Hadji Ivat (Greek: Hadjiavatis) than any other characters, and often he is informed by him, sometimes they cooperate in business, but sometimes Hadjiavatis is a victim of Karagiozis' tricks.
*'''Kollitiria''' (Κολλητήρια), Karagiozis' three kids. Some versions give their names as (from older and taller to younger and shorter) Kollitiris, Svouras and Mirigkokos.
*'''Aglaia''', (Αγλαΐα) Karagiozis' wife, who is usually unseen but whose characteristically nagging voice is heard to be coming from inside Karagiozis's house.
*'''Hadjiavatis''' (Χατζηαβάτης), (the Turkish counterpart is [[Hacivat]]) he is Karagiozis' friend and sidekick, an honest and serious figure but often ends up being wrapped up in Karagiozis' schemes. He has a tendency to flatter the powerful and is sometimes depicted as a compliant person towards the occupying and dominant establishment, contrasting Karagiozis.
*'''Barba Yorgos''' (Μπάρμπα Γιώργος, "Uncle George"), he represents a crude villager from the mountains, depicted as a shepherd or dairy farmer usually on some business related visit in the lowlands; he is depicted as a [[Vlach]] from [[Rumeli]] uncontaminated by urban trends, always depicted broad built and strong with traditional outfit. Even though he believes his nephew to be a crook, he helps him out and beats all the opponents black and blue with his staff.
*'''Stavrakas''' (Σταύρακας), whose puppet is the only one with a long independent arm, like Karagiozis. He represents the "[[mangas]]" culture prevalent in Piraeus and the [[Rebetiko]] tradition. Although trying to [[bullying|bully]] the others, Karagiozis usually teases him.
*'''Sior Dionysios''' (Σιορ Διονύσιος), an Italianate gentleman from [[Zakynthos]] of some aristocratic stock. Faithful to his [[Ionian Islands]] origin, he sings ''cantades'' and speaks the Ionian Greek dialect with the appropriate accent.
*'''Morfonios''' (Μορφονιός), a European bred softie; he is very ugly with a huge head with an extremely large nose; however, he considers himself to be handsome and keeps falling in love. He often exclaims a sound like "whit!"
*'''Solomon''' (Σολομών), a usually rich [[Jew]] from [[Thessaloniki]], one of the less known characters, he speaks in his own fashion, sometimes uttering a very fast repeating sound often compared to a [[Gatling gun]], earning him, by Karagiozis, the nickname "heavy arms", despite his frail build. His personality can vary, but usually plays minor roles.
*'''[[Vizier]]''' (Βεζύρης), also called '''[[Pasha]]''' (Πασάς) in some versions, he is the dominant figure of the occupying side and lives in the [[Sarayi]]. He is usually the beginning of each new tale, by announcing trials, deeds, tests etc. to which Karagiozis usually decides to become involved.
*'''Fatme''' (Φατμέ) is the Vizier or Pasha's beautiful daughter who has either obedient or rebellious roles; she has more than one way of causing trouble sometimes for good, opposing her despotic father or for bad in dislike of Karagiozis or some other hero.
*'''Veligekas''' (Βελιγκέκας), an [[Albanians|Albanian]] guard of the Sarai. He is the executive arm of the Pasha, always in the lookout for Karagizis and never waste an opportunity to give him a good beating. Usually gets beaten though by Barba Giorgos.
*'''Peponias''' (Πεπόνιας), a fat officer of the Sarai, in some versions replacing Veligekas.

Some players have introduced other characters, like Karagiozis's old father and Nontas, Stavrakas' friend.

== The puppets ==
All the figures that represent the characters of the shows are two dimensional and designed always in profile. They were traditionally made from camel skin, carved to allow light through the image, creating details, but are today most often made of cardboard. Traditional puppets gave off black shadows against the white screen, but some more recent puppets have holes covered with colored silk or plastic gel materials to create colored shadows.  The torso, waist, feet and sometimes the limbs, were separate pieces that were joined together with pins. Most figures were composed of two parts (torso and legs) with only one joint to the waist. Two characters, the [[Jew]] and Morfonios had joints in the neck, and had a flexible head.
They were moved with a stick attached to their 'back', except in the case of the figure of Karagiozis, Stavrakas and a few other characters whose arms or other limbs required separate movement. The 'scene' was a vertical white parapet, usually a cloth, called ''mperntes'' (from Turk. 'perde', curtain). Between the figures and the player (who was invisible), were candles or lamps that shed light to the figures and made their [[silhouette]]s and colours visible to the audience through the cloth.

== Modern incarnations ==

Conrad, also known as ''Karaghiosis'', the protagonist of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[...And Call Me Conrad]]'' (also known as ''This Immortal''), which won the 1966 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]], is partially inspired by this character.

In Greek daily speech, the name Karagiozis is also used as an insult more or less like ''[[clown]]''. Puppeteers complain about this, saying that while Karagiozis can be violent, mischievous, a liar and an anti-hero, he is also good-natured and faithful, so his name should not be used as an insult.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

During the 1980s, Greek Television had Karagiozis shows on a weekly basis. These shows had more modern and educational themes, like for example Karagiozis living some myths of [[Greek mythology]] or visiting the moon and other planets. Some of these episodes were either live with an audience, or filmed especially for the TV show and contained scenes that required editing or special effects.

There have been several recent attempts to make Karagiozis incarnations in [[comic book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retromaniax.gr/vb/attachment.php?attachmentid=613&amp;d=1219947763 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082919/http://www.retromaniax.gr/vb/attachment.php?attachmentid=613&amp;d=1219947763 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, Karagiozis is not so popular as a choice of recreation for young kids and the number of puppeteers has diminished, but remains a significant and well known folkloric figure. Today, he is performed mostly in folk feasts or festivals and on national Greek television. There are also occasional tours in the [[Greek diaspora]].

'''Kozma Petrovich Prutkov''' ({{lang-ru|Козьма́ Петро́вич Прутко́в}}) is a fictional author invented by  [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]] and his cousins, three Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, [[Alexei Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexei]], [[Vladimir Zhemchuzhnikov|Vladimir]] and [[Alexander Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexander]], during the later part of the rule of [[Nicholas I of Russia]].

The four distinguished satirical poets used this [[pseudonym]] as a collective [[pen name]] to publish [[aphorism]]s, [[fable]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire|satiric]], [[humor]]ous and [[nonsense verse]]s in the 1850s&amp;ndash;1860s, most notably in the literary magazine "[[Sovremennik]]" (''The Contemporary'').

According to the ''Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://az.lib.ru/p/prutkow_k_p/text_0010.shtml Биографические сведения о Козьме Пруткове], (Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov), first printed in the ''Full Collection of Works'', 1884 (lib.ru)&lt;/ref&gt; Prutkov was born on April 11, 1803 and died on January 13, 1863. He worked for the government of the [[Russian Empire]] his entire adult life, and in 1820 entered military service as a [[Hussar]] only for the uniform. He worked at the Assay Office (Пробирная Палата) from 1823 until his death, ending up as its director.

&lt;!-- Please do not edit or put some nonsense in this article. You are in act of vandalism. --&gt;
This is a '''list of analog television stations in the Philippines'''. Currently, there are three major networks competing for bigger audience share; [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]], [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] and [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] Major [[free-to-air]] networks are popularly known by their flagship channels (example [[DZBB-TV|GMA 7]] (Manila) instead of simply [[GMA Network]]). Analog television in the Philippines began to shut down on February 28, 2017, and is scheduled to complete by 2023.&lt;ref name=ntcph&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov't wants analog TV switched off by 2023|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/599484/money/companies/gov-t-wants-analog-tv-switched-off-by-2023|website=gmanetwork.com|date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, all analog TV stations are still using the [[NTSC]] standard.

'''''Lugosi v. Universal Pictures''''', 603 [[P.2d]] 425 (Cal. 1979), was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]] respecting the [[personality rights]] of celebrities, particularly addressing whether these rights descended to the celebrities' heirs. The suit was brought by the heirs of [[Béla Lugosi]], who sued [[Universal Pictures]] in 1966 for using his personality rights without the heirs' permission. The trial court ruled in favor of the Lugosi heirs, but Universal Studios won the case in an appeal. The court determined that a dead person had no right to their likeness, and any rights that existed did not pass to his heirs.&lt;ref name=findlaw/&gt;

==History==
In September 1930, [[Béla Lugosi]] and [[Universal Pictures]] had entered into an agreement for the production of the film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' in which Lugosi played the title role under a signed contract. Hope Linninger Lugosi, his widow, and [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela George Lugosi]], his son, filed a complaint against Universal on February 3, 1966, alleging that they were the heirs of Béla Lugosi and that Universal had, commencing in 1960, appropriated and continued to appropriate property which they had inherited from Lugosi and which was not part of the agreement with Universal. The Lugosis asserted that from 1960 until the present time, Universal entered into many licensing agreements which authorized the licensees to use the Count Dracula character.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Lugosi heirs] seek to recover the profits made by [Universal Studios] in its licensing of the use of the Count Dracula character to commercial firms and to enjoin [Universal Studios] from making any additional grants, without [their] consent .... The action, therefore, raises the question of whether Béla Lugosi had granted to [Universal] in his contracts with [Universal] merchandising rights in his movie portrayal of Count Dracula, the nature of such rights, and whether any such rights, if retained by Béla Lugosi, descended to the [Lugosi heirs] ....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ruling==
After eleven years of litigation, the trial judge ruled in favor of the Lugosi heirs, and awarded them $70,000 and barred [[Universal Studios]] from merchandising Lugosi's likeness.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Who Can Inherit Fame? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952724,00.html |quote=Ten years later, the son and the widow of [[Béla Lugosi]], star of the Dracula films, tried to take this doctrine a step further. They argued that this right was essentially property and therefore should pass on to heirs. In a California suit, they asked the courts to stop [[Universal Pictures]] from merchandising 70 Dracula products, ranging from jigsaw puzzles to belt buckles, and sought compensation based on the profits. Citing the First Amendment, Universal replied that the design of merchandise is a form of free speech that should not be restrained by anyone's heirs. Besides, said Universal's lawyer, Robert Wilson, Lugosi "attained fame and fortune because the company made and distributed the movies he starred in." After eleven years of wrangling, a trial judge decided in favor of the Lugosis, giving them $70,000 and barring Universal from merchandising Lugosi's likeness. ... In December the California Supreme Court reversed the Lugosi decision. |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date= July 7, 1980 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was appealed and the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled that "the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime." The result was a loss for the concept of inheriting [[personality rights]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Feb/1/130405.html |title=Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979). |accessdate=2007-02-14 |quote=In this decision preceding (and precipitating) the Legislature's enactment of Section 990, the California Supreme Court held that rights of publicity were not descendible in California. Béla Lugosi's heirs, Hope Linninger Lugosi and Bela George Lugosi, sued to enjoin and recover profits from Universal Pictures for licensing Lugosi's name and image on merchandise reprising Lugosi's title role in the 1930 film, "Dracula." The California Supreme Court faced the question whether Béla Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime. Lugosi, 603 P.2d at 431.  |publisher=[[FindLaw]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[California Celebrities Rights Act]] of 1986 created an inheritable right to a person's name or likeness for 70 years after death. Legislation passed in 2007 extended that right retroactively to all persons who have died since January 1, 1938.

'''Max Force''' was a line of [[toy weapon]]s made by [[Jakks Pacific]] to compete with [[Hasbro]]'s [[Nerf Blaster]]s. Instead of foam darts, Max Force guns fired "Soft Splat Pellets", which are made of a mixture of paper and wood. These pellets were dipped into water before being loaded into the guns and fired at distances up to 100 feet. The Soft Splat Pellets disintegrated upon impact without causing any bodily harm.

The Max Force Terrornator 85 was demonstrated in the July 13, 2011 episode of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', wherein [[David Letterman]] mentioned that "you can save US$40 and [[Spitball (prank)|get a straw and napkin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/the_wahoo_gazette/?year=2011&amp;month=07&amp;day=13&amp;direct=true Late Show Wahoo Gazzette - Wednesday, July 13, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the Max Force line has been discontinued.

'''Mersin Aquapark''' is a [[waterpark]] in [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]]

==Geography==
The aquapark is situated to the west of the [[Atatürk Park]] and the western breakwater of [[Mersin Harbor]]. An amusement park and [[Müftü River]] are to the west and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline is to the south of the aquapark.

==History==
The aquapark was established by the Mersin municipality with a total cost of 35 million Turkish liras (During the construction 1.7 TL = $1). But in 2012 a Mersin citizen filed a lawsuit claiming that the establishment does not respect the relevant coastal regulations which give the priority of the coastal usage to public. The court ruled that the establishment must be removed. Mersin municipality challenged the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haber33.com/35-milyon-liraya-yapilan-mersin-aquapark-mahkeme-6768960-haberi/ Haber 33 news {{tr icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150219125211/http://www.haber33.com/35-milyon-liraya-yapilan-mersin-aquapark-mahkeme-6768960-haberi/ |date=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
In the 50-decare aquapark there is an Olympic pool, two children’s pools, diving towers, five  waterslides with different heights and a skating rink. There are also coffee houses, reaturants and a ball room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaparkim.com/mersin_aqua_park/mersin-buyuksehir-belediyesi-aquapark.html Aquapark page)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219163640/http://www.aquaparkim.com/mersin_aqua_park/mersin-buyuksehir-belediyesi-aquapark.html |date=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gezilecekyer.org/mersin-aquapark-mersin-akuapark-hakkinda-bilgi/ Mersin touristic info {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miss 1917''''' is a musical [[revue]] with a book by [[Guy Bolton]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]], music by [[Victor Herbert]], [[Jerome Kern]] and others, and lyrics by [[Harry B. Smith]], [[Otto Harbach]], [[Henry Blossom]] and others. Made up of a string of [[vignette (literature)|vignette]]s, the show features songs from such musicals as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''Three Twins'', ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' and ''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]''.&lt;ref name= "song"&gt;{{cite web|title=Song List of Miss 1917|url=http://ibdb.com/production-songs.php?ShowNo=6125&amp;ProdNo=8607|work=IBDB: The Official Source for Broadway Information|publisher=[[The Broadway League]]|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background==
In 1916, [[Charles Dillingham]] and [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] produced ''The Century Girl'', with music by [[Irving Berlin]]. Despite mildly positive reviews, the show closed without recouping its investment.&lt;ref name="blib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss 1917, musical revue (collab. with V.Herbert)|url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/571304.html#tvf=tracks&amp;tv=about|work=Classical Archives|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their next production, which was to be called ''Miss 1917'', they hired [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Victor Herbert]] to compose the score and [[Guy Bolton]] and [[P.G. Wodehouse]] to collaborate on the book. Kern and Bolton had collaborated on the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals, including ''[[Very Good Eddie]]'' (1915). British humorist and playwright Wodehouse then joined them for several innovative musicals there, including [[Oh, Boy! (musical)|Oh, Boy!]] (1917).&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John.

=== Involvement of George Gershwin ===
The show is mostly known today as [[George Gershwin]]'s introduction to musical theatre.&lt;ref name="book3"&gt;{{cite book| last=Pollack|first=Howard|title=George Gershwin, His Life and Career|year=2006| publisher= University of California Publishing|location=California|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; During rehearsals for ''Miss 1917'', Gershwin conducted the [[pit orchestra]] and played the piano.&lt;ref name="blib"/&gt; He was hired in October 1917, being paid $35 each week. As the rehearsal period extended, Gershwin earned more money.&lt;ref name= "book2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyland|first=William|title=Gershwin: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoKvjKEsf0MC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=george+gershwin+miss+1917&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lIK02_dM_J&amp;sig=dqFKk-lumDEWRxDn7jJpQD01oyI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j45-TYmqBcyEtgeQmeDXCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20gershwin%20miss%201917&amp;f=false |work=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] (2003)| accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later record Kern's "The Land Where the Good Songs Go", which was used in the revue, as a [[piano roll]] in January 1918.&lt;ref name= "book2"/&gt;

While working for the show, Gershwin and his brother [[Ira Gershwin]] befriended Herbert and Kern, keeping "in contact with some of the major figures on Broadway".&lt;ref name= "book2"/&gt; Sunday night concerts held in New York City by the show's cast introduced Gershwin's "There's More to a Kiss Than the Sound" and "You-oo, Just You", both with lyrics by [[Irving Caesar]].&lt;ref name= "book2"/&gt;  "Gershwin had begun work on Broadway as a rehearsal pianist for the Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert musical ''Miss 1917''. Within months, his talent as a composer was noticed by everyone in the show and he was quickly put under contract by Harms Music.&lt;ref name="book3"/&gt; His involvement with ''Miss 1917'' brought him to the attention of music producer Harry Askins, who in turn mentioned him to [[Max Dreyfus]], "one of the giants of music publishing".&lt;ref name="book3"/&gt;

== 1917 Broadway production ==
The producers of the show "had demanded extremely elaborate staging for the revue", so no out-of-town tryouts were held, and the show premiered directly on Broadway on 5 November 1917, at the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|Century Theatre]].&lt;ref name="blib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordman|first=Gerard Martin| title= American musical theatre: a chronicle|year=1978|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York| pages= 373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viagas|first=Robert|title=Today in Theatre History: November 5|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/73183-Today-in-Theatre-History-NOVEMBER-5|work=[[Playbill]]|accessdate=13 March 2011|date=5 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164804/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/73183-Today-in-Theatre-History-NOVEMBER-5|archivedate=29 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was staged, directed and supervised by [[Ned Wayburn]], with choreography by Adolph Bohm. The creative team also included set designer [[Joseph Urban]], who built a rotating [[thrust stage]] for the theatre. Costume design was attributed to eight designers, including Paul Chaflin, [[Willy Pogany]], and Max Weldy.

The original cast starred comedian [[Lew Fields]], [[Andrew Tombes]] and [[Vivienne Segal]]. it also included George White, [[Ann Pennington (actress)|Ann Pennington]], [[Charles King (vaudevillian)|Charles King]], Bessie McCoy Davis, Bert Savoy, [[Irene Castle]], [[Marion Davies]], [[Lilyan Tashman]]  and the comedic team [[Van and Schenck]].&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt; Kern originally wanted Segal to sing "[[They Didn't Believe Me]]" in the revue, though Dillingham and Herbert preferred her to sing "[[Kiss Me Again (song)|Kiss Me Again]]". Segal's siding with the latter caused tension among the creative team.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt; According to a member of the production crew, technical rehearsals were interrupted several times due to disagreements in staging and choreography; at one point, Kern sought to close the show early, though Ziegfeld wouldn't have it.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite news|title='Miss 1917' Musical Cancels International Stagings|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 June 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent events ===
A month after ''Miss 1917'' closed on Broadway, on 21 February 1918, items used in the show were sold in an auction, raising $11,300, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''. Most of the items for auction were bought by [[J. J. Shubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Miss 1917" Brings $11,300 at Sale|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 February 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Sam Harrison of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] bought the performing rights to the musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boys Century Plays|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 February 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; A London transfer, planned for March 1920, as well as a US national tour were cancelled. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the creative team would not allow Ziegfeld to stage the show internationally due to planned major staging and plot changes that he hoped would make the humour more accessible to international audiences.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;

== Premise ==
''NCIS: Los Angeles'' follows Special Agent G. Callen ([[Chris O'Donnell]]), a "legend" assigned to the Office of Special Projects (OSP), a fictitious branch of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (the real-life NCIS has no offices in Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil/AboutNCIS/Locations/Pages/default.aspx|title=NCIS Office Locations  |website=Naval Criminal Investigative Service|publisher=[[US Department of Defense]]|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callen leads an elite team of undercover operatives as they battle enemies both foreign and domestic under the watchful eye of Operational Manager Henrietta "Hetty" Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]). The team is composed of Agent Kensi Blye ([[Daniela Ruah]]), a hand-to-hand combat specialist and forensic whiz, Sam Hanna ([[LL Cool J]]), a former Navy SEAL and G's partner, technical analyst [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Eric Beale|Eric Bartholomew Beale III]] ([[Barrett Foa]]), and ranking team member Shay Mosley ([[Nia Long]]), NCIS Executive Assistant Director for Pacific Operations (EAD-PAC).

Over the course of the series, the team are assisted by allies from both NCIS and its local counterparts, including LAPD liaison officer Marty Deeks ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]), Intelligence Analyst Nell Jones ([[Renee Felice Smith]]), Operational Psychologist Nate Getz ([[Peter Cambor]]), and rookie field agent Dominic Vail ([[Adam Jamal Craig]]), all of whom work side-by-side with NCIS Assistant Director Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]), a laconic agent and skilled bureaucrat.

== Cast and characters ==
{{Main|List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters}}

=== Main ===
* [[G. Callen]]&lt;!-- Please continue to use the name commonly used by this character for the first 160 episodes of this series and not the name only recently added in the 160th episode of the series. Specifics on name revelations should be included in the characters article. --&gt; ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) (birthname Grisha Aleksandrovich Nikolaev) is the Lead Senior Special Agent and undercover operative attached to the NCIS Office of Special Projects.  He speaks several languages fluently, including Russian, German, and French.  Callen is a highly skilled field agent having worked numerous overseas undercover assignments.  Placed in the foster system at a young age, G. did not know his first name but eventually learned about his family, and in turn, himself. As G. lives somewhat of a nomadic nature, Los Angeles is G's most stable home. He is partnered with Sam Hanna.&lt;ref name="reuters090227"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSTRE51Q13620090227|title=O'Donnell nabs lead role in "NCIS" spin-off|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=February 27, 2009|work=Reuters|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304021052/http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSTRE51Q13620090227|archivedate=March 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Nate "Doc" Getz|Nate Getz]] ([[Peter Cambor]]) is an Operational Psychologist originally attached to OSP in order to monitor the team's emotional well-being. Valued as both an agent and a doctor, Getz is later drafted to a deep cover operation and subsequently becomes a well-established field agent. Despite his career change, Getz still returns to Los Angeles when needed (season 1; recurring seasons 2−8).
* [[Kensi Blye]] ([[Daniela Ruah]]) is the daughter of a Marine and, initially, the only female Special Agent attached to OSP. Her father died at a young age, after which Kensi spent some time living on the streets. Estranged from her mother, Kensi is a skilled undercover operative and sniper who is not afraid to use her sexuality to get results. She is engaged to her partner Marty Deeks.
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Dominic Vail|Dominic Vail]] ([[Adam Jamal Craig]]) is a probationary agent and a technical specialist who was assigned to OSP straight out of training. He is partnered with Kensi and seen as a sort of younger brother to the other team members; NCIS Los Angeles is left devastated when, following a period as a missing person, Dom is assassinated during his own rescue mission (season 1).
* [[Sam Hanna (character)|Sam Hanna]] ([[LL Cool J]]) is the team's Senior Field Agent and G's partner. Sam has the most stable home life of the team as he is married with children. He met his wife on the job and still lives for the thrill of undercover work. He is a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]], an expert on Middle Eastern culture, and speaks fluent Arabic, and as such he not only provides invaluable insight on cases involving the USMC and USN, but also on cases involving ethnicity.&lt;ref name="ncislegends" /&gt;
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Hetty Lange|Henrietta "Hetty" Lange]] ([[Linda Hunt]]) is a Supervisory Special Agent and the team's Operational Manager. As a veteran undercover operative, Hetty has achieved an unbelievable amount during her life, with distinguished work as an overseas intelligence operative during the Cold War. During her younger years, she took in several orphans (including Callen and Hunter) from the streets in order to mold them into undercover operatives.
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Eric Beale|Eric Beale]] ([[Barrett Foa]]) is the team's Technical Operator and resident geek. He is not an undercover operative like his teammates and as such is not firearms trained. Beale is incredibly comfortable in the OSP much to the chagrin of his teammates who often become annoyed by his quirks such as leaving his surf board by their cars. He is partnered and close friends with Nell (season 1 onwards; recurring season 1).
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Marty Deeks|Marty Deeks]] ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]) is a veteran Los Angeles Police Department Detective who worked undercover and was exiled socially within the LAPD.  Deeks is also an experienced attorney at law having worked as a Public Defender in the Los Angeles Criminal Courts prior to joining the LAPD. After he is selected by Hetty to be the LAPD's Liaison Officer to NCIS, it becomes clear that her plan is for Deeks to become an Agent. He has not had the easiest childhood and deflects a great deal using humor. He is partnered with, and engaged to, Kensi (season 2 onwards; recurring season 1).
* [[list of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Nell Jones|Nell Jones]] ([[Renée Felice Smith]]) is a Special Agent who acts as the team's intelligence analyst. She is just as comfortable outside the office as in it, and it appears that Hetty is grooming her as a replacement. Jones is a highly capable field operative and extremely skilled firearms expert. She has the highest IQ of anybody at NCIS. She is partnered and close friends with Eric (season 2 onwards; recurring season 2).
* [[List of NCIS: Los Angeles characters#Owen Granger|Owen Granger]] ([[Miguel Ferrer]]) is the Assistant Director of NCIS. He is the team's link to Washington, and while he is often seen at loggerheads with his subordinates, he no doubt has a great desire to keep them safe. Unlike other administrators, he is not afraid to accompany the team into the field. Granger spent many years overseas as a field agent on many hazardous assignments before becoming an administrator. He is a long time friend and sometimes adversary of Hetty.  Miguel Ferrer's last appearance as Owen Granger was on the Season 8 episode "Payback", which aired on February 19, 2017 (seasons 5–8; recurring seasons 3–4).
* Shay Mosely ([[Nia Long]]) is a former Secret Service agent who becomes the NCIS Executive Assistant Director for Pacific Operations (EAD-PAC) (seasons 9–10).

=== Recurring ===
* Indira G. Wilson/[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Michelle Hanna aka "Quinn" (seasons 3–8): 
: Sam Hanna's wife, Michelle is a former deep-cover CIA operative. At the end of the eighth season, Michelle is kidnapped and murdered by Tahir Khaled in a vendetta against Sam.

== Production ==
Special Agent G. Callen was initially a CIA operative created by Shane Brennan for a series that was never produced. After taking over show runner duties previously held by [[Donald P. Bellisario]] on ''NCIS'', he used the potential of a spin-off to bring his story to fruition.

Brennan intended for the series to hold a ''[[Miami Vice]]''-esque vibe through its two co-leads, Callen and Agent Sam Hanna. However, the character of Lara Macy was written to serve as a parallel for Gibbs, the lead of the original NCIS team. Macy was portrayed by [[Louise Lombard]] in the backdoor pilot, but she was not featured in the actual spin-off, and Brennan was able to produce the show as he originally envisioned it.

The show was known as ''NCIS: Legend'' while in production ([[List of NCIS: Los Angeles episodes#Introductory episodes|referring to the episodes of ''NCIS'']] in which the spin-off was introduced), and other names considered included ''OSP: Office of Special Projects'', ''NCIS: OSP'' and ''NCIS: Undercover''.&lt;ref name="futoncritic"/&gt; Filming started in February 2009, with the characters being introduced in the two-part ''NCIS'' episode titled "[[NCIS (season 6)#ep135|Legend]]", the first part of which aired on April 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="futoncritic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="firstepisoderelease"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20090407cbs07|title=CBS Press Release for NCIS episode "Legend"|publisher=CBS ''via'' The Futon Critic|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 8, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112210215/https://tv.yahoo.com/news/cbs-renews-madam-secretary-scorpion-ncis-orleans-170824469.html|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode served as a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for the series, in a manner similar to the way ''NCIS'' was introduced by way of a two-part episode of ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]''.

== Reception ==
[[File:NCIS Filming (8 March 2009) 5.jpg|thumb|Filming the pilot episode in 2009]]

=== Critical reception ===
"Identity", the series' first episode, garnered 18.73 million viewers with a 4.4/11 share in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic and therefore won its timeslot. It was the second most watched show of the week, behind only the original ''NCIS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Seidman |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/23/ncis-gains-in-demos-goes-over-20-million-20-60m-in-broadcast-finals/28200 |title=NCIS gains in 18–49 demo, goes over 20 million (20.60M) in broadcast finals |publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927164103/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/23/ncis-gains-in-demos-goes-over-20-million-20-60m-in-broadcast-finals/28200 |archivedate=September 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the show have been mixed. It has a score of 59/100 on [[Metacritic]]. According to Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "The crime is intriguing and multifaceted, its resolution requiring a nice balance of street smarts and lots of gunfire. But as with the original "NCIS", the emphasis is on the characters of the team... Los Angeles, meanwhile, looks fabulous, a pleasing mixture of noir and gridlock, and there's an air of stability that's comforting in these uncertain times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-ncis-los-angeles22-2009sep22,0,7303276.story |title=Noir meets Navy in 'NCIS: Los Angeles' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |first=Mary |last=McNamara |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926065238/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-ncis-los-angeles22-2009sep22%2C0%2C7303276.story |archivedate=September 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' reviewer, David Hinckley, was more critical of the show saying that although "It all adds up to an hour of decent entertainment, and there's room for enough character development to give "NCIS: Los Angeles" a personality of its own, ... a premiere episode shouldn't feel even a little like something we've already seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Hinckley |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/09/22/2009-09-22_ll_cool_j_chris_odonnell_and_ncis_los_angeles_solid_not_super_as_cbs_seeks_a_new.html |title=LL Cool J, Chris O'Donnell and 'NCIS: Los Angeles' solid, not super as CBS seeks a new 'CSI' |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |location=New York |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925182336/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/09/22/2009-09-22_ll_cool_j_chris_odonnell_and_ncis_los_angeles_solid_not_super_as_cbs_seeks_a_new.html |archivedate=September 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt that, "NCIS: Los Angeles gets the job done ... It's a procedural that follows strictly the established procedure, but it has likable characters, dislikable bad guys and the occasional flabbergasting shot of L.A."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/21/AR2009092103706.html |title='NCIS' 2 Nabs The Formula |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Tom |last=Shales |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110103214/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/21/AR2009092103706.html |archivedate=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' summarized it as a "serviceable hour that takes the NCIS formula—a light tone and a lot of banter wrapped around a fairly rudimentary investigatory plot—and transfers it to a special, undercover NCIS division in Los Angeles. Nothing more, but also nothing less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2009-09-21-ncis-los-angeles-review_N.htm |title='NCIS' popularity should keep spinoff in hunt |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925181711/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2009-09-21-ncis-los-angeles-review_N.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the show to ''The A-Team'' with "the same lighthearted approach to life-or-death situations.

On November 5, 2012, [[Deadline Hollywood]] reported the first news about a spin-off of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' titled ''NCIS: Red''.

The '''Opera dei Pupi''' ({{lang-scn|Òpira dî pupi}}; {{lang-en|"Opera of the Puppets"}}) is a [[marionette]] theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' or ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of [[Sicily]]. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional [[puppet theater]]s featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. 

The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of ''cantastorîas'' (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal [[troubadour]] tradition in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]].

The Sicilian marionette theater Opera dei pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= El teatro de marionetas siciliano Opera dei Puppi |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00011|author=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionnettists, such as the Greco of [[Palermo]]; the Canino of [[Cinisi]] and [[Alcamo]]; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of [[Catania]], Pennisi and Macri of [[Acireale]], Profeta of [[Licata]], Gargano and Grasso of [[Agrigento]].
 
Anyway, you can admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino, and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano [[Giuseppe Pitrè]] in [[Palermo]]. 
Other beautiful marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in [[Randazzo]]. The [[Center for Puppetry Arts]], in Atlanta GA, also has a display of marionettes in this style.

A '''photo op''' (sometimes written as '''photo opp'''), short for '''photograph opportunity''' ('''photo opportunity'''), is an arranged opportunity to take a [[photograph]]  of a [[politician]], a [[celebrity]], or a notable event.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hungarian/specials/177_buzzwords/page39.shtml "Photo Op"], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the administration of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. [[William Safire]] credited its coinage to Bruce Whelihan, an aide to Nixon [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]] [[Ron Ziegler]]. Ziegler would say ''Get 'em in for a picture'', and Whelihan would dutifully announce to the White House press room, ''There will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/magazine/on-language-in-nine-little-words.html?pagewanted=all On Language; In Nine Little Words]", [[The New York Times]], 26 March 1989. Accessed 2 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has acquired a negative connotation, referring to a carefully planned [[pseudo-event]], often masqueraded as news.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=339464 "Commentary (The Photo Opportunity)"], from [[CBS Evening News]] for Saturday, July 27, 1991; at the Vanderbilt Television News Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with politicians who perform tasks such as planting trees, picking up litter, and visiting senior citizens, often during [[election]] cycles, with the intent of [[photographer]]s catching the events, generating positive [[publicity]]. 

Among nearly ritual photo ops are those when participants of a [[summit (meeting)|summit]] get out of their cars, shake hands or kiss, or sign a document.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Formal, planned photography sessions in the [[White House]] date back to the 1930s, when [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[press secretary]] advised photographers to avoid taking photos of the President in a [[wheelchair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6774/ "Photo Op"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Playbour''' (sometimes spelled '''playbor''') is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article ''Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.'' Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/kucklich_print.html|title=Precarious Playbour: Modders and the Digital Games Industry|last=Kücklich|first=Julian|date=|website=journal.fibreculture.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the [[gamification]] of society in general.

== History ==
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer [[game modification]], or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modding ===
Creating [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; [[Open-source software|open-source]] software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] (1993).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|date=3 September 2007|title=On modder labour, commodification of play, and mod competitions|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2006|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most famous modder creation is probably [[Counter-Strike]], originally a team-based mod for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy around playbour and modding ==
Not only is modding a big part of [[Video game culture|gaming culture]], but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to that, mods may help with establishing [[brand]]s (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/playbour-farming-and-labour|title=Playbour, farming and labour|last=Goggin|first=Joyce|date=|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on [[social media]]. The experience of play also has value in itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/15/gamification-playbor-exploitation-2/|title=Gamification, Playbor &amp; Exploitation|last=Patella-Rey|first=PJ|date=16 October 2012|work=The Society Pages|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}
A '''promotional recording''', or '''promo''', or '''plug copy''', is an audio or video recording distributed free, usually in order to promote a recording that is or soon will be commercially available. Promos are normally sent directly to broadcasters, such as [[music radio]] and [[music television|television]] stations, and to tastemakers, such as DJs and [[music journalism|music journalists]], in advance of the release of commercial editions, in the hope that airplay, reviews, and other forms of exposure will result and stimulate the public's interest in the commercial release.

Promos are often distributed in plain packaging, without the text or artwork that appears on the commercial version. Typically a promo is marked with some variation of the following text: "Licensed for promotional use only. Sale is prohibited." It may also state that the promo is still the property of the distributor and is to be "returned upon demand." However, it is not illegal to sell promotional recordings,&lt;ref&gt;...at least not in the U.S., where the ''UMG v. Augusto'' case clarified in 2011 that promos are gifts, not the property of the distributor, and that the [[first-sale doctrine]] entitles the recipient to dispose of the recording as they wish.&lt;/ref&gt; and recalls of promos are extremely rare and unenforced.&lt;ref&gt;That is, at least in the U.S., the recipient of a promo has no obligation to comply with a recall, unless a separate contract is in effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because promos are produced in smaller quantity than releases made available to the general public, they are sometimes considered valuable collectors' items. They are never intended for sale in record stores.

== Promotional single ==
{{update|date=May 2015}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Promo copy.jpeg|right|thumb|Label of a promo single. Note the text saying "PROMOTIONAL NOT FOR SALE"]] --&gt;
A ''promotional single'' is a single that is made available to [[radio stations]], [[nightclubs]], music publications, and other media outlets by a [[record label]] to promote a commercial [[Single (music)|single]] or [[album]]. A song may be released as a promotional single even if no commercial version of the single is available to buy. While intended specifically for use by professional [[disc jockeys]] and not for resale, they are frequently sought out by music collectors nonetheless.

The promo single is usually recognized by its limited liner notes and cover artwork as well as its unique catalog number (or the occasional lack thereof). Quite often, [[vinyl records]] will be issued in a generic cardboard jacket or white paper sleeve while [[CDs]] will be issued in a slimline [[jewel case]] or cardboard sleeve.

There may also be promotion-specific terms stamped on the disc or its cover, most notably "For Promotional Use Only" and "Not For Resale."

The ''advance promo single'' is furnished to DJs sometimes weeks or months in advance of a domestic release to give record labels an opportunity to build interest in the single and gauge response to the single. Unlike a finished promo single, these are commonly test pressings or [[white labels]] and thus are manufactured in limited runs. Traditionally, these promotional copies were supplied to DJs through [[music pool]]s. Despite the good intention, there has been some dispute within the industry whether an advanced promotion is a good thing or not. Building interest is naturally a good thing, but it may have the opposite effect when interested persons are unable to find a new song in the record stores for quite some time.

==Buzz singles and advance singles{{anchor|Buzz single}}==
In music, a '''buzz single''' or  {{anchor|Advance single}}'''advance single''' is a track or promotional song, released by the label (typically) preceding the album's release.  The song(s) are released in order to bring attention to an album's release.  Buzz singles are not typically issued to radio as promotional singles, due to the fact that they are only intended to attract minor attention compared to a regular single.

== Acetates and test pressings ==
On rare occasions a special type of demonstration record known as an [[acetate disc]] has been distributed to radio stations as a promo. Instead of being mass-produced these records are cut one at a time in the recording studio from a master tape source.  They were generally made in very low quantity with hand-written labels. The soft acetate surface of these discs can be played no more than about 10 times before they start to wear out.

Another type of rare item which has occasionally been used as a promo is a "test pressing" or [[white label]].  These are the first disc copies pressed at the factory. They are used to check manufacturing quality before mass production begins.

== Countdown to album release programs ==
[[iTunes]] and other markets distribute songs for a price on a pre-set schedule; such as one a week in a 'Countdown' to the parent album's release. These pre-sales of album tracks are often called 'promotional singles' by many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2010/11/17/black-eyed-peas-release-do-it-like-this-announce-single-a-week-until-the-beginning.htm|title=Black Eyed Peas Release "Do It Like This" - Announce Single a Week Until The Beginning|author=|first=Bill|last=Lamb|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=2 April 2011|work=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/blog/2010/11/30/black-eyed-peas-the-beginning-new-album/|title=Black Eyed Peas, 'The Beginning' -- New Album|author=AOL Music Staff|date=2010-11-30|accessdate=2 April 2011|work=[[AOL Music]]|publisher=[[AOL|AOL inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
=== Radio outlets ===
Promotional recordings are distributed to commercial [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations for airplay. These singles typically feature just the [[radio edit]] of the song, but may also include alternate remix edits, the original album version, or even call-out hooks

=== Nightclub outlets ===
When it comes to [[electronic dance music]], 12-inch records and CDs still remain the more popular media by which promotional recordings may be distributed to DJs in the nightclub industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These singles typically feature one or more extended remixes (sometimes dubbed a "club mix") of the title track that are not generally available to the public as well as the original extended version, which in many cases is itself club-friendly. In some cases, the disc may have anonymous track labeling or lack labels altogether. Often the corresponding CD may also carry radio edits and other alternate cuts that did not make it onto the 12-inch record itself, in which case the CD is referred to as a [[maxi-single]] CD. Promotional recordings may also include digital recordings in [[MP3]], [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]], or [[Windows Media Audio]] formats to discourage illegal copying and enable effective recall when the promotional period has expired.

It is not unusual for a promo single to have no commercially available counterpart particularly in those genres that are predominantly oriented to nightclub applications.

=== Promotional compilations ===
Many companies currently offer promotional compilations to DJs, radio use and nightclubs alike. The format is growing on the CD format, but some companies still offer promotional compilations in vinyl also.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Most of the compilations are genre-specific (like most of CD Pools' compilations) but there are also compilations that offer a combination of different genres (like compilations from DMC and Music Factory). Such compilations are normally released monthly. In addition to companies that work internationally, there are also many companies that offer national promotions material in the form of compilations.

Versions in the compilation are usually either radio edits or extended / 12" remixes of the song, depending a bit on the targeted audience. Club scene music is usually in the longer and easier to play format of extended remix, whereas more street targeted music is usually released as radio edits. It normally takes a couple of weeks after the release of the original promo single to be available on promotional compilations. This has the added benefit of having the songs when they're already had some airtime and are thus not the bleeding edge no-one has heard from, but still have usually not been released to the mass markets yet.

Some of the internationally established companies are [[CD Pool]] and [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]]. Many fledgling companies are also available offering both well-known and lesser known releases.

=== Online promotional distribution ===
Since the advent of broad-bandwidth Internet access and professional tools such as iPool or Haulix, the online promotional distribution of music has been established. Record companies make their music available as audio files and use the Internet as a distribution channel. In contrast to the conventional way of distributing promotional recordings, this kind of promotional distribution is faster and cheaper.

'''Roy Claxton Acuff''' (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[country music]] singer, fiddler, and promoter, [[freemason]]&lt;ref name ="stjohnslodgedc.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | title = Famous Freemasons in the course of history | language = en | website = stjohnslodgedc.org | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151116030150/http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | archive-date = Nov 15, 2015 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Known as the "King of Country Music," Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early [[string band]] and "hoedown" format to the singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952, [[Hank Williams]] told Ralph Gleason, "He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the [[Southern United States|South]], it was Roy Acuff, then God."&lt;ref&gt;Escott, Colin (2004). ''Hank Williams: The Biography''. Back Bay Books. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acuff began his music career in the 1930s and gained regional fame as the singer and fiddler for his group, the Smoky Mountain Boys. He joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry's key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, Acuff and [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] founded [[Acuff-Rose Music]], the first major [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based country music publishing company, which signed such artists as [[Hank Williams]], [[Roy Orbison]], and the [[Everly Brothers]]. In 1962, Acuff became the first living inductee into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=rumble&gt;Rumble, John (1998). "Roy Acuff".

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Maynardville-acuff-marker-tn2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|THC marker along Maynardville Highway (TN-33) in Maynardville, Tennessee, near where Acuff was born]]
Acuff was born on September 15, 1903&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in America, with World Notables, v. 10: 1989–1993|year=1993|publisher=Marquis Who's Who |location=New Providence, N.J.|isbn=0-8379-0220-7|page=2|chapter=Acuff, Roy Claxton}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Maynardville, Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="Harvard Bio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Randel|first=Don Michael, ed. |title=The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music|year=1996|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-37299-9|page=3|chapter=Acuff, Roy (Claxton)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Ida (née Carr) and Simon E. Neill Acuff, the third of their five children. The Acuffs were a fairly prominent family in [[Union County, Tennessee|Union County]]. Roy's paternal grandfather, Coram Acuff, had been a [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee state senator]], and his maternal grandfather was a local physician. Roy's father was an accomplished fiddler and a [[Baptist]] preacher, his mother was proficient on the piano, and during Roy's early years the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings. At such gatherings, Roy would often amuse people by balancing farm tools on his chin. He also learned to play the [[harmonica]] and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]] at an early age.&lt;ref name=larkin&gt;Larkin, Colin, ed. (2006). "Roy Acuff." ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Vol. 1''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;

In 1919, the Acuff family relocated to [[Fountain City, Tennessee|Fountain City]] (now a suburb of [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]), a few miles south of Maynardville.&lt;ref name=larkin /&gt; Roy attended [[Central High School (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Central High School]], where he sang in the school chapel's choir and performed in "every play they had."&lt;ref name=wolfe1&gt;Green, Doug; Wolfe, Charles, eds. "[http://www.lynnpoint.com/st_james/oldtimemusic_knoxville.pdf Roy Acuff Recalls His Early Days in Knoxville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607103019/http://www.lynnpoint.com/st_james/oldtimemusic_knoxville.pdf |date=2013-06-07 }}." ''Old Time Music'', vol. 12 (Spring 1974), p. 21. Large PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; His primary passion, however, was athletics. He was a three-sport standout at Central and, after graduating in 1925, was offered a scholarship to [[Carson-Newman University]] but turned it down. He played with several small baseball clubs around Knoxville, worked at odd jobs, and occasionally boxed.&lt;ref name=rumble /&gt;

In 1929, Acuff tried out for the [[Tennessee Smokies|Knoxville Smokies]], a minor-league baseball team then affiliated with the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] (now the [[San Francisco Giants]]).&lt;ref name=goo&gt;Hurst, Jack (1975). ''Nashville's Grand Ole Opry''. New York: H. N. Abrams. pp. 27–28, 37, 108-111, 119–122, 138–139, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfe1 /&gt; A series of collapses in spring training following a sunstroke, however, ended his baseball career. The effects left him ill for several years, and he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] in 1930.&lt;ref name=larkin /&gt; "I couldn't stand any sunshine at all," he later recalled.&lt;ref name=wolfe1 /&gt; While recovering, Acuff began to hone his fiddle skills, often playing on the family's front porch after the sun went down. His father gave him several records of regionally renowned fiddlers, such as [[Fiddlin' John Carson]] and [[Gid Tanner]], which were important influences on his early style.&lt;ref name=wolfe1 /&gt;

===Early music career===
In 1932, Dr. Hauer's [[medicine show]], which toured the southern Appalachian region, hired Acuff as one of its entertainers.&lt;ref name=larkin /&gt; The purpose of the entertainers was to draw a large crowd to whom Hauer could sell medicines (of suspect quality) for various ailments.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; While on the medicine show circuit, Acuff met the legendary Appalachian banjoist [[Clarence Ashley]], from whom he learned "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" and "Greenback Dollar", both of which Acuff later recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Joe (2001). "Tom Ashley." CD liner notes for ''Greenback Dollar: The Music of Clarence "Tom" Ashley''. [[County Records]].&lt;/ref&gt; As the medicine show lacked microphones, Acuff learned to sing loud enough to be heard above the din, a skill that would later help him stand out on early radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;

In 1934, Acuff left the medicine show circuit and began playing at local shows with various musicians in the Knoxville area, where he had become a celebrity and fixture in local newspaper columns.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Neely, "[http://www.knoxmercury.com/2016/05/25/paper-pixels-project-reveals-surprising-nuggets-local-history/ 'Papers to Pixels Project' Reveals Surprising Nuggets of Local History]". ''Knoxville Mercury'', 25 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the guitarist Jess Easterday and the [[Hawaiian guitar]]ist Clell Summey joined Acuff to form the Tennessee Crackerjacks, which performed regularly on the Knoxville radio stations [[WATE-TV|WROL]] and [[WNOX]] (the band moved back and forth between stations as Acuff bickered with their managers about compensation).&lt;ref name=larkin /&gt; Within a year, the group had added the bassist Red Jones and changed its name to the Crazy Tennesseans after being introduced as such by a WROL announcer named Alan Stout.&lt;ref name=wolfe1 /&gt; Fans often remarked to Acuff how "clear" his voice was coming through over the radio, important in an era when singers were often drowned out by string band cacophony.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; The popularity of Acuff's rendering of the song "[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|The Great Speckled Bird]]" helped the group land a contract with [[American Record Corporation|ARC]], for which they recorded several dozen tracks (including the band's best-known track, "[[Wabash Cannonball]]") in 1936.&lt;ref name=goo/&gt; Needing to complete a 20-song commitment, the band recorded two ribald tunes—including "[[When Lulu's Gone]]"—but released them under a pseudonym, the Bang Boys.&lt;ref&gt;Schlappi, Elizabeth. ''Roy Acuff, the Smoky Mountain Boy''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7NYutp7s-oC&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28]. 1997 reprint of Pelican Publishing ([[Gretna, Louisiana]]), 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The group split from ARC in 1937 over a separate contract dispute.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;

===Grand Ole Opry===
In 1938, the Crazy Tennesseans moved to Nashville to audition for the Grand Ole Opry. Although their first audition went poorly, the band's second audition impressed Opry founder [[George D. Hay]] and producer Harry Stone, and they offered the group a contract later that year. On Hay and Stone's suggestion, Acuff changed the group's name to the Smoky Mountain Boys, referring to the [[Great Smoky Mountains|mountains near where he and his bandmates grew up]].&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; Shortly after the band joined the Opry, Clell Summey left the group and was replaced by the [[dobro]] player Beecher (Pete) Kirby—best known by his stage name [[Bashful Brother Oswald]]—whom Acuff had met in a Knoxville bakery earlier that year.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; Acuff's powerful lead vocals and Kirby's dobro playing and high-pitched backing vocals gave the band its distinctive sound. By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added the guitarist Lonnie "Pap" Wilson and the banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band's lineup. Within a year, Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys rivaled the long-time Opry banjoist [[Uncle Dave Macon]] as the troupe's most popular act.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;
In the same period, he was initiated to the [[Masonic Lodge]] of East Nashville No. 560&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | title = List of famous freemasons | website = freemasonry.bcy.ca | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20011004153632/http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | quotation = East Nashville No. 560, TN [19]| archive-date = Oct 4, 2001 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="stjohnslodgedc.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = al Manhal | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=Qc5aDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=%22Lodge+No.+560+Nashville+TN.+%22%2BAcuff%2BRoy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLISlKIbgQ&amp;sig=CqUtBsF79-R5oAYVaOIMiN7GPeM&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiklMWWg-PdAhVMtIsKHWWrBxYQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lodge%20No.%20560%20Nashville%20TN.%20%22%2BAcuff%2BRoy&amp;f=false | title = Initiation in Freemasonry | language = ar | website = Google Books | year = 2009 | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | page = 231 | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In spring 1940, Acuff and his band traveled to [[Hollywood]], where they appeared with Hay and Macon in the motion picture ''Grand Ole Opry''. Acuff appeared in several subsequent B-movies, including ''[[O, My Darling Clementine]]'' (1943), in which he played a [[singing cowboy|singing sheriff]]; ''[[Night Train to Memphis]]'' (1946), the title of which comes from a song Acuff recorded in 1940; and ''Home in San Antone'' (1949), in which he starred with [[Lloyd Corrigan]] and [[William Frawley]].

Acuff and his band also joined Macon and other Opry acts at various tent shows held throughout the Southeast in the early 1940s. The crowds at these shows were so large that roads leading into the venues were jammed with traffic for miles.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; Starting in 1939, Acuff hosted the Opry's ''Prince Albert'' segment. He left the show in 1946 after a dispute with management.&lt;ref name=tehc&gt;Cusic, Don (2009)."[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=3 Roy C. Acuff]." ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acuff-Rose===
In 1942, Acuff and songwriter [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] (1897–1954) formed Acuff-Rose Music. Acuff originally sought the company in order to publish his own music, but soon realized there was a high demand from other country artists, many of whom had been exploited by larger publishing firms.&lt;ref name=escott&gt;Colin Escott, "Roy Acuff." In ''The Essential Roy Acuff: 1936–1949'' [CD liner notes]. Sony Music Entertainment, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Due in large part to Rose's [[ASCAP]] connections and gifted ability as a talent scout, Acuff-Rose quickly became the most important publishing company in country music. In 1946, the company signed [[Hank Williams]], and in 1950 published their first major hit, [[Patti Page]]'s rendition of "[[Tennessee Waltz]]".&lt;ref&gt;Don Cusic, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=4 Acuff-Rose]. ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2009. Retrieved: 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Acuff was initiated into the East Nashville Freemasonic Lodge in Tennessee, of which he would remain a lifelong member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research|first=Masonic|title=Famous Freemasons|url=http://www.pinallodge30.com/famousmasons.aspx|publisher=Pinal Lodge No. 30|accessdate=28 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224182230/http://www.pinallodge30.com/famousmasons.aspx|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, Acuff invited Tennessee Governor [[Prentice Cooper]] to be the guest of honor at a gala held to mark the nationwide premiere of the Opry's ''Prince Albert'' show. Cooper rejected the offer, however, and lambasted Acuff and his "disgraceful" music for making Tennessee the "hillbilly capital of the United States."&lt;ref name=escott /&gt; A Nashville journalist reported the governor's comments to Acuff and suggested Acuff run for governor himself. While Acuff initially did not take the suggestion seriously, he did accept the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination for governor in 1948.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;&lt;ref name=escott /&gt;

Acuff's nomination caused great concern for [[E.H. Crump]], the head of a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] political machine that had dominated Tennessee state politics for nearly a quarter-century. Crump was not worried so much about losing the governor's office—in spite of Acuff's name recognition—but did worry that Acuff would draw large crowds to Republican rallies and bolster other statewide candidates. While Acuff did relatively well and helped reinvigorate Tennessee's Republicans, his opponent, [[Gordon Browning]], still won with 67 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bergeron, et al. ''Tennesseans and Their History'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faber&gt;Charles Faber. "Roy Acuff." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
After leaving the Opry, Acuff spent several years touring the Western United States, although demand for his appearances dwindled with the lack of national exposure and the rise of musicians such as [[Ernest Tubb]] and [[Eddy Arnold]], who were more popular with younger audiences.&lt;ref name=rumble /&gt; He eventually returned to the Opry, although by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of [[Sparta, Tennessee]], in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows,&lt;ref name=goo /&gt; and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald.

In 1972, Acuff's career received a brief resurgence in the folk revival movement after he appeared on the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] album, ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''.&lt;ref name=faber /&gt; The appearance paved the way for one of the defining moments of Acuff's career, which came on the night of March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the [[Ryman Auditorium]] to the Grand Ole Opry House at [[Opryland USA|Opryland]]. The first show at the new venue opened with a huge projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band's 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band's performance of "Wabash Cannonball". That same night, Acuff showed President [[Richard Nixon]], an honored guest at the event, how to [[yo-yo]], and convinced the president to play several songs on the piano.&lt;ref name=goo /&gt;

In the early 1980s, after the death of his wife, Mildred, Acuff, then in his 80s, moved into a small house on the Opryland grounds and continued performing daily on stage. He arrived early most days at the Opry before the shows and performed odd jobs, such as stocking soda in backstage refrigerators. In 1991, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#91 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}. Retrieved: 15 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and given a lifetime achievement award by the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], the first Country music act to receive the esteemed honor. Roy Acuff died in Nashville on November 23, 1992 of [[congestive heart failure]] at the age of 89.&lt;ref name=tehc /&gt;

==Repertoire and legacy==
Many of Acuff's songs show a strong religious influence, most notably "Great Speckled Bird", "The Prodigal Son" and "Lord, Build Me a Cabin". Such songs were typically set to a traditional Anglo-Celtic melody, which is most apparent on "Great Speckled Bird" and the 1940 recording "The Precious Jewel". Acuff performed popular songs of the day, including [[Pee Wee King]]'s "Tennessee Waltz" and [[Dorsey Dixon]]'s "I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray", the latter of which he appropriated and renamed "[[Wreck on the Highway (1938 song)|Wreck on the Highway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|d43g8unp7Wk|"Wreck on the Highway, Dorsey Dixon, I Didnt Hear Nobody Pray"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also recorded a version of the [[Cajun]] fiddler [[Harry Choates]]'s "Jole Blon". Traditional recordings included "Greenback Dollar", which he probably learned from Clarence Ashley while on the medicine show circuit, and "Lonesome Old River Blues", which he recorded with the Smoky Mountain Boys in the 1940s. Acuff and the Crazy Tennesseans recorded "Wabash Cannonball"—another traditional song—in 1936, although Acuff did not provide the vocals on this early recording. The better-known version of the song with Acuff providing the vocals was recorded in 1947.&lt;ref name=escott /&gt;

In 1979, Opryland opened the Roy Acuff Theatre, which was dedicated in Acuff's honor (it was demolished in 2011 after suffering extensive damage in the [[2010 Tennessee floods]]). [[Dunbar Cave State Park|Dunbar Cave State Natural Area]] was established in 1973 from a recreational area the state had purchased from Mrs. McKay King. The cave was owned by Acuff from 1948 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Van West, Carroll (2009). "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=409 Dunbar Cave State Natural Area]." ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''. Retrieved: 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two museums have been named in Acuff's honor—the Roy Acuff Museum at Opryland (now closed) and the Roy Acuff Union Museum and Library in his hometown of Maynardville. Acuff has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 1541 Vine Street. He is pictured with other country singers at the new Smoky Mountain Opera in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]], Tennessee.

'''Sean Cody''' is a [[gay pornography]] studio founded in fall 2001.  The website predominantly features young, muscular, men in solo and hardcore bareback scenes. Sean Cody has a strict model selection, with contracts requiring no prior pornographic experience ('exclusive' men).

Sean Cody was run by the company Cody Media [[Incorporation (business)|Inc]] from 2003 until 2015 where it was sold to porn conglomerate [[MindGeek]] (who owns other competitor studios such as [[Men.com]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/c/Cody-Media-Inc/28560195|title=Cody Media Inc|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="queermenowscsale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Cody Acquired by MindGeek (Men.com)|url=http://www.queermenow.net/blog/sean-cody-mencom/|website=www.queermenow.net|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raised some considerable questions around the quality and exclusivity of the content, as the same parent company owned the content-sharing websites that have negatively affected many other studios. A 2014 article by internet magazine Slate explained how "MindGeek has become the porn monopoly, putting industry members in the paradoxical position of working for the very company that profits from the piracy of their work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Auerbach|first1=David|title=Vampire Porn|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/mindgeek_porn_monopoly_its_dominance_is_a_cautionary_tale_for_other_industries.single.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|agency=Slate|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Devon Hunter, an escort and model who had performed in SeanCody videos under the name "Ryan", wrote a detailed account of his experience while filming for the company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devonhunter.info/archives/1625/ "Know Before You Go, Part 1: Sean Cody"]&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that he experienced homophobia on set and went on to criticize "gay for pay" scenes. An intense, international debate across many blogs began over the "gay for pay" debate in porn. It intensified when SeanCody released Hunter's personal information in retaliation to Queerty.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerty.com/diary-of-a-sean-cody-performer-20100621 "Diary of a Sean Cody Performer"]&lt;/ref&gt; which came under intense criticism for the outing and deleted the post.

In January 2012, SeanCody.com's parent company filed suit in a federal court against 122 unidentified file sharers for allegedly trading unauthorized copies of the site's first condom-free video, "Brandon &amp; Pierce Unwrapped", in December 2011. This was the first time Sean Cody sued over online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pardon |first=Rhett |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/143616 |title=Sean Cody's Parent Company Files Porn BitTorrent Suits Against 122 |publisher=XBIZ.com |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Teofil Brank, who had modeled for Sean Cody under the name Jarec Wentworth, was arrested for allegedly [[extorting]] a [[magicJack|Magicjack Vocaltec Ltd.]] executive, Donald Burns, who is also a prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political activist.

'''Steve Denning''' (born 11 January 1944) works in leadership, management, innovation, and [[organizational storytelling]].

==Biography==
Stephen Denning was born 11 January 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linked Authority File for Denning, Stephen |url=http://errol.oclc.org/laf/n00-84485.html |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |accessdate=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sydney, Australia. He studied law and psychology at the [[University of Sydney]] and worked as a lawyer in Sydney for several years. He did a postgraduate degree in law at [[Oxford University]].

Denning worked for several decades at the [[World Bank]] in many capacities and held various management positions, including Director of the Southern Africa Department from 1990 to 1994, Director of the Africa Region from 1994 to 1996, and Program Director for Knowledge Management from 1996 to 2000. After leaving the [[World Bank]] &lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Tom and Prusak, Larry 'What's the Big Idea? Creating and Capitalizing on the Best New Management Thinking, Harvard Business Review Press, 2002, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000 he published five books on leadership storytelling and established himself as a global leader in the field.  In 2001 he initiated the annual Organizational Storytelling Weekend in Washington D.C. under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.

In 2010 he broadened the focus of his work with his book, ''The Leader’s Guide to Radical Management: Reinventing the Workplace for the 21st Century'' (Jossey-Bass, 2010). In this book he argues that present day management needs to be reinvented. He sets out the principles and practices needed to accomplish that through five major shifts: (1) a shift in the firm’s goal from producing outputs to delighting the customer; (2) a shift in the role of the manager from a controller to an enabler of self-organizing teams; (3) a shift in the way work is coordinated from bureaucracy to dynamic linking, (4) a shift from value to values; and (5) a shift from top-down commands to conversation

The '''Telsiz ve Radyo Amatörleri Cemiyeti''' ('''TRAC''') (in [[English language|English]], '''Wireless and Radio Amateur Society''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Turkey]].  The organization was founded in 1962 as the '''Türkiye Radyo Amatörleri Cemiyeti''', adopting its current name in 1980.  With its headquarters located in [[Istanbul]], TRAC has branches in 46 locations across Turkey.  TRAC is the national member society representing Turkey in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]].&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008). [http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html "Member Societies"].  Retrieved Aug. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Due to the difficulties related to the existing government regulations at that time, the organization initially focused on [[electronics]] training.  TRAC published a monthly electronics [[magazine]], which became a reference journal in Turkey for those who wanted to learn about electronics. The magazine was recommended by the Ministry of Education as a learning aid.

TRAC began [[lobbying]] the government for amateur radio regulations two years after its formation.  Two attempts to establish an amateur radio service in Turkey were made in 1964 and again in 1966.  Joint proposals by the Ministry of Defence, TRAC, and the Electric Engineers' Association, these efforts to change the existing law found their way to a [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|parliament]]ary commission but were never put into the legislative agenda.  Amateur radio regulations were finally established in 1983 with the passage of the Wireless Act. Historically, Turkey has suffered major [[natural disaster]]s in which many have perished. Amateur radio's crucial importance and efficiency in establishing [[amateur radio emergency communications|emergency communications]] during disasters and emergencies was cited as a main reason for establishing an active amateur radio service in Turkey.

== Activity ==
Key membership benefits of TRAC include the sponsorship of [[amateur radio operating award]]s and radio [[contesting|contests]], and a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those members who regularly communicate with [[amateur radio operator]]s in other countries.  TRAC represents the interests of Turkish amateur radio operators before Turkish and international telecommunications regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name="trac"&gt;Telsiz ve Radyo Amatörleri Cemiyeti (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">'''''The Neddeaus of Duqesne Island''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] comedy [[web series]], which premiered on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s CBC Comedy web platform in 2017.&lt;ref name=weirdness&gt;[http://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/workaholic-vancouver-native-kelly-mccormack-embraces-digital-weirdness "Workaholic Vancouver native Kelly McCormack embraces digital weirdness"]. ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', July 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[mockumentary]] presented as "lost footage" of a 1970s-era documentary, the series focuses on the Neddeaus, a family who have lived in isolation on a remote [[Northern Ontario]] island and are being profiled in a documentary by filmmaker Ford Francis Mayflower. Its premiere was accompanied by ''Not for Broadcast'', a short promotional trailer which explored the series' fictionalized backstory as a documentary film which was made in the 1970s, but suppressed by the CBC for political reasons and never seen by anyone outside of Canada's media and political elites until 2017; the trailer included commentary from public figures such as [[Jean Chrétien]] and [[David Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://occhimagazine.com/actress-kelly-mccormack-talks-the-neddeaus-of-duqesne-island-and-syfys-killjoys/ "Actress Kelly McCormack Talks “The Neddeaus of Duqesne Island” and SyFy’s “Killjoys”"]. ''Occhimag'', July 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its cast includes Tara Samuel, [[Colin Mochrie]], Tim Walker, [[Kelly McCormack]], Aaron Schroeder, Ted Martin, Keith Stanton, Caitlin Driscoll and [[Cara Gee]]. Schroeder was the writer and creator of the series, and Schroeder and McCormack were the executive producers.&lt;ref name=weirdness/&gt;

The series was produced by Floyder Films and Duqesne Island Productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://playbackonline.ca/2017/05/25/cbc-goes-for-the-x-factor-with-ott-service/ "CBC reveals plans for new OTT service"]. ''[[Playback (website)|Playback]]'', May 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series received three [[Canadian Screen Award]] nominations at the [[6th Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2018, for Best Direction in a Web Program or Series (Sam Zvibleman), Best Actor in a Web Program or Series (Schroeder) and Best Actress in a Web Program or Series (Samuel). Zvibleman won the award for Best Direction.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the [[Starfleet]] starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]]. In this episode, the crew respond to a distress call from Dr. Paul Manheim ([[Rod Loomis]]). While the crew must deal with the results of Manheim's haywire experiments with time, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) must deal with his former love Jenice ([[Michelle Phillips]]), who is also Manheim's wife.

The story of the episode was influenced by the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and was affected by the timing of the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]]. Because of the strike, the script was written in five days and it was only when it was filmed that it was discovered to be incomplete. Shearer was not happy with the result and felt that the on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Phillips was lacking. Reviews of the episode have been mixed, with one reviewer summing it up by saying "there’s nothing I can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes."&lt;ref name=tor.com /&gt;

==Plot==
The ''Enterprise'', along with other ships in the sector, experience a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Captain Picard [Patrick Stewart] recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they make contact with the facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.

The two are brought aboard and while Dr. [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) tends to Dr. Manheim, who is having convulsions, Picard discovers his wife is Jenice, Picard's former love. Jenice warns that her husband was working privately in his laboratory, but that she didn't know what he was working on. She also alerts the crew to numerous security protocols that he has installed at the facilities. As the crew prepares to send an away-team to investigate the laboratory, they experience more time distortions, described by [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) as "Manheim effects". In one instance Picard, Riker and Data enter a turbolift only to see their past selves conversing outside of the lift. The crew find that they cannot complete a transporter beam to the facility due to the security measures in place there.

Dr. Manheim recovers long enough to explain that he was doing experiments involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.

As he is affected less by the distortions, Data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds a column of energy emanating from a dimensional matrix, the source of the time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at a Paris café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.

==Production==
"We'll Always Have Paris" is named in reference to the [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.&lt;ref name=nemecek57&gt;[[#Nemecek2003|Nemecek (2003)]]: p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the title of the episode and the [[love triangle]] in the story, the Blue Parrot Café from the film is directly mentioned by Captain Picard. ''Casablanca'' was also the basis for the earlier ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' novel ''The Entropy Effect'', and would be so again in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Profit and Loss (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Profit and Loss]]".&lt;ref name=tor.com /&gt;

The story was originally pitched by [[Hannah Louise Shearer]] and [[Deborah Dean Davis]], who were also given the job of developing the script. The writing of the episode suffered from the timing of the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]], with Shearer and Dean Davis completing the script in five days.&lt;ref name=nemecek57/&gt; The premise of the story was a combination of their idea of a story "about a professor whose work wasn't appreciated and had to go off on his own" and that of [[Maurice Hurley (screenwriter)|Maurice Hurley]] who wanted a story with a time anomaly.&lt;ref name=gross93/&gt; The final draft was dated 22 February and featured numerous differences from the filmed version, including Jenice being called Laura, a number of different interactions for the crew, and Riker, Worf and Data all being involved in shutting down Manheim's equipment. The script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed, but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where Data was to fix the time distortions hadn't been completed.&lt;ref name=nemecek57/&gt;

[[Robert Legato]] and [[Rick Berman]] spent forty minutes on the telephone with Shearer during the strike. While she refused to write the lines during the strike, Berman suggested dialogue and Shearer would give opinions with Legato taking down handwritten notes. Legato decided on the directing notes himself, and used a [[whip pan]] shot instead of an effects shot to film the three Datas as director [[Robert Becker (director)|Robert Becker]] had never used effects shots previously.&lt;ref name=nemecek57/&gt; Shearer wasn't happy with the final result, saying "we were writing the most romantic episode in the world" but that "it was toned down 75%".&lt;ref name=gross93&gt;[[#grossaltman1993|Gross; Altman (1993)]]: p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Shearer later complained of a lack of chemistry between [[Michelle Phillips]] and Patrick Stewart, which Phillips blamed on the conflicted nature of the character in that she was committed to her husband but also wanted to see Picard once more. Phillips, a ''Star Trek'' fan, is better known for being a member of the 1960s group [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. [[Rod Loomis]]'s previous science fiction outing was in ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' as [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Lance Spellerberg]] would later return in "[[The Icarus Factor]]" where his transporter chief gained the name Ensign Herbert.&lt;ref name=nemecek57/&gt; The image of 24th century Paris was a [[matte painting]] which was re-used in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' where it was hung outside the office of the Federation president.&lt;ref name=nemecek57/&gt;

==Reception==
"We'll Always Have Paris" aired in [[broadcast syndication]] during the week commencing May 5, 1988. It received [[Nielsen rating]]s of 9.7, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was the same ratings received as the previous episode, "[[Skin of Evil]]".&lt;ref name=nemecek56&gt;[[#Nemecek2003|Nemecek (2003)]]: p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Nielsen Ratings – Seasons 1–2|url=http://treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|website=''TrekNation''|publisher=UGO Networks|accessdate=June 12, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001005185203/http://treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|archivedate=October 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode on behalf of [[TrekNation]] in September 2007, comparing certain elements of the episode to ''Casablanca'' and the series finale "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]". These included the ending where time distortions caused Data to be replicated three times in "We'll Always Have Paris" compared to the similar situation with three Picards in "All Good Things...". Overall she thought that the episode was better than she recalled previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=We'll Always Have Paris|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/tng/well_always_have_paris.shtml|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=''TrekNation''|date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website "Jammer's Reviews" described the episode as too simple, especially the ending which he said was "they give Data a canister, which he sticks into a hall of mirrors; problem solved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epsocokhan|first=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation "We'll Always Have Paris"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-tng/s1/paris.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zack Handlen, reviewing the episode for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in May 2010, said that he enjoyed the "time blips" in the episode, but that he wasn't a fan of the romance between Jenice and Picard. He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and that he seemed to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Handlen|first=Zac|title="We'll Always Have Paris"/"Conspiracy"/"The Neutral Zone"|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/well-always-have-parisconspiracythe-neutral-zone,41626/|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=The A.V.

He thought that Michele Phillips was "incredibly radiant", and said, "there’s nothing I can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes", giving it a score of four out of ten.&lt;ref name=tor.com&gt;{{cite news|last=DeCandido|first=Keith|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: "We’ll Always Have Paris"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/star-trek-the-next-generation-rewatch-qwell-always-have-parisq|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=Tor.com|date=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wembley Stadium Bowl''' and Starlight Restaurant was an entertainment and dining venue situated just west of the [[The Empire Pool|Empire Pool]] (now the SSE Arena) in [[Wembley Park]], [[Wembley]], north-west [[London]].

In the early 1960s American-style [[Ten-pin bowling|tenpin bowling]] alleys became popular in the UK. In 1962 a bowling alley and restaurant was built west of the Empire Pool.  The Stadium Bowl boasted 24 bowling lanes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Wembley|last=Hewlett|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Brent Library Service|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lion Roars at Wembley|last=Knight &amp; Sabey|first=Donald R. &amp; Alan|publisher=Donald R.

The name Starlight for the restaurant was probably inspired by the Starlight Dance held in the neighbouring Empire Pool on 17 October 1959, which was one of the very first popular music events held at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Live Music in Britain, Volume I: 1950-1967: From Dance Hall to the 100 Club|last=Frith, Brennan &amp; Webster|first=Simon, Matt &amp; Emma|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=1409422801|location=|pages=183–4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenpin bowling competitions were held at the Stadium Bowl, some reported on [[Pathé News|Pathé]] newsreels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Pathé|title=King Of Tenpin (1963)|date=2014-04-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVDsEBA1xGk|accessdate=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was the London International Matchplay tournament, which ran at Wembley from 1962 to 1972, before moving to the Airport Bowl in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wp.talktenpin.net/2017/08/19/2017-london-international-results-and-history/|title=2017 London International – Results and History|date=2017-08-19|work=Talk Tenpin|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the cup for the Coca-Cola Bottlers International Masters Championship was presented to winner John Wilcox of the USA by England football captain [[Bobby Moore]], whose team had just won the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wp.talktenpin.net/2017/08/01/on-to-wembley-stadium-a-world-cup-story-by-keith-hale/|title=ON TO WEMBLEY STADIUM – A World Cup Story by Keith Hale|date=2017-08-01|work=Talk Tenpin|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general manager in the early 1970s was called Ralph Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wp.talktenpin.net/2017/08/01/on-to-wembley-stadium-a-world-cup-story-by-keith-hale/|title=ON TO WEMBLEY STADIUM – A World Cup Story by Keith Hale|date=2017-08-01|work=Talk Tenpin|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenpin bowling craze declined relatively quickly and had largely died out by 1972. The Stadium Bowl became a 15-court squash centre in November 1974, hosting the [[British Open Squash Championships]] from 1975 to 1980.  It has since been demolished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
In 2010, the WFMT celebrated its 25th anniversary. The seeds for the development of the World Federation of Music Therapy were sown during the second World Congress of Music Therapy in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1976. A group of [[United States|American]], [[Europe]]an, and [[South America]]n music therapists met and started to develop a plan for unity and standards in the international arena of music therapy. Among the ten founding members were Rolando Benenzon (Argentina), Giovanna Mutti (Italy), Jacques Jost (France), Barbara Hesser (USA), Amelia Oldfield (UK), Ruth Bright (Australia), Heinrich Otto Moll (Germany), Rafael Colon (Puerto Rico), Clementina Nastari (Brazil), and Tadeusz Natanson (Poland). The Federation was formally established during the 5th World Congress of Music Therapy in Genoa, Italy, in 1985. Anecdotal reports about the beginnings of WFMT as well as the founder’s motivation can be found at the online journal, ''Voices.''&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, B.

&lt;br /&gt;
The WFMT Council uses online sources such as the WFMT website, blog, podcasts, videos, social media, emails and an annual report to communicate with its members and others associated with music therapy. The WFMT Council also holds symposia, panels, and roundtables at major international conferences to inform others about global music therapy developments and the most recent projects in WFMT.
