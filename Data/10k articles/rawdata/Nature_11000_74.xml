The '''1889–1890 flu pandemic''' (October 1889 – December 1890, with recurrences March – June 1891, November 1891 – June 1892, winter 1893–1894 and early 1895) was a deadly [[influenza pandemic]] that killed about 1 million people worldwide. The outbreak was dubbed "Asiatic flu" or "Russian flu" (not to be confused with the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1#Russian flu|1977–1978 epidemic]] caused by Influenza A/USSR/90/77 [[H1N1]], which was also called Russian flu). For some time the virus strain responsible was conjectured (but not proven) to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2]].{{sfn|Hilleman|2002|p=3068}}{{sfn|Madrigal|2010}} More recently, the strain was asserted to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N8]].{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Outbreak and spread==
Modern transport infrastructure assisted the spread of the 1889 influenza. The 19 largest European countries, including the [[Russian Empire]], had 202,887&amp;nbsp;km of railroads and transatlantic travel by boat took less than six days (not significantly different than current travel time by air, given the time scale of the global spread of a pandemic).{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

The pandemic was first recorded in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia in December 1889. In four months it had spread throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Deaths peaked in Saint Petersburg on December 1, 1889, and in the United States during the week of January 12, 1890. The median time between the first reported case and peak mortality was five weeks.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Identification of virus subtype responsible==
Researchers have tried for many years to identify the subtypes of [[Influenza A]] responsible for the 1889–1890, 1898–1900 and [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]] epidemics. Initially, this work was primarily based on "seroarcheology"—the detection of antibodies to influenza infection in the sera of elderly people—and it was thought that the 1889–1890 pandemic was caused by Influenza A subtype H2, the 1898–1900 epidemic by subtype H3, and the 1918 pandemic by subtype H1.{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=820}} With the confirmation of [[H1N1]] as the cause of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] following identification of H1N1 antibodies in exhumed corpses,{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=821}} reanalysis of seroarcheological data has indicated that Influenza A subtype H3 (possibly the [[H3N8]] subtype), is the most likely cause for the 1889–1890 pandemic.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=825}}

'''Absolute molar mass''' is a process used to determine the characteristics of [[molecule]]s.

== History ==
The first [[absolute measurements]] of molecular weights (i.e. made without reference to standards) were based on [[fundamental physical characteristic]]s and their relation to the molar mass. The most useful of these were [[Osmometry|membrane osmometry]] and [[sedimentation]].

Another absolute instrumental approach was also possible with the development of [[light scattering]] theory by [[Einstein]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman|Raman]], [[Peter Debye|Debye]], [[Bruno H. Zimm|Zimm]], and others. The problem with measurements made using membrane osmometry and sedimentation was that they only characterized the bulk properties of the [[polymer]] sample. Moreover, the measurements were excessively time consuming and prone to [[operator error]]. In order to gain information about a [[polydisperse]] mixture of molar masses, a method for separating the different sizes was developed.  This was achieved by the advent of [[size exclusion chromatography]] (SEC).  SEC is based on the fact that the pores in the packing material of [[chromatography|chromatography columns]] could be made small enough for molecules to become temporarily lodged in their interstitial spaces. As the sample makes its way through a column the smaller molecules spend more time traveling in these void spaces than the larger ones, which have fewer places to "wander". The result is that a sample is separated according to its [[hydrodynamic volume]] &lt;math&gt;V_h&lt;/math&gt;.  As a consequence, the big molecules come out first, and then the small ones follow in the elutent.  By choosing a suitable column packing material it is possible to define the resolution of the system.  Columns can also be combined in series to increase resolution or the range of sizes studied.

The next step is to convert the time at which the samples eluted into a measurement of molar mass.  This is possible because if the molar mass of a standard were known, the time at which this standard eluted should be equal to a specific molar mass. Using multiple standards, a [[calibration curve]] of time versus molar mass can be developed. This is significant for polymer analysis because a single polymer could be shown to have many different components, and the complexity and distribution of which would also affect the physical properties.  However this technique has shortcomings.  For example, unknown samples are always measured in relation to known standards, and these standards may or may not have similarities to the sample of interest. The measurements made by SEC are then mathematically converted into data similar to that found by the existing techniques.

The problem was that the system was calibrated according to the Vh characteristics of polymer standards that are not directly related to the molar mass. If the relationship between the molar mass and Vh of the standard is not the same as that of the unknown sample, then the calibration is invalid. Thus, to be accurate, the calibration must use the same polymer, of the same conformation, in the same eluent and have the same interaction with the solvent as the hydration layer changes Vh.

Benoit ''et al.'' showed that taking into account the hydrodynamic volume would solve the problem.  In his publication, Benoit showed that all synthetic polymers elutes on the same curve when the log of the intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molar mass was plotted against the elution volume.  This is the basis of universal calibration which requires a viscometer to measure the intrinsic viscosity of the polymers.  Universal calibration was shown to work for branched polymers, copolymers as well as starburst polymers.

For good chromatography, there must be no interaction with the column other than that produced by size.  As the demands on polymer properties increased, the necessity of getting absolute information on the molar mass and size also increased. This was especially important in pharmaceutical applications where slight changes in [[molar mass]] (e.g. [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]]) or shape may result in different [[biological activity]]. These changes can actually have a harmful effect instead of a beneficial one.

To obtain molar mass, [[light scattering instruments]] need to measure the intensity of light scattered at zero angle.  This is impractical as the laser source would outshine the light scattering intensity at zero angle.  The 2 alternatives are to measure very close to zero angle or to measure at many angle and extrapolate using a model (Rayleigh, Rayleigh-Gans-Debye, Berry, Mie, etc.) to zero degree angle.

Traditional light scattering instruments worked by taking readings from multiple angles, each being measured in series. A low angle light scattering system was developed in the early 1970s that allowed a single measurement to be used to calculate the molar mass. Although measurements at low angles are better for fundamental physical reasons (molecules tend to scatter more light in lower angle directions than in higher angles), low angle scattering events caused by dust and contamination of the mobile phase easily overwhelm the scattering from the molecules of interest.  When the low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) became popular in the 1970s and mid-1980s, good quality disposable filters were not readily available and hence multi-angle measurements gained favour.

Multi-angle light scattering was invented in the mid-1980s and instruments like that were able to make measurements at the different angles simultaneously but it was not until the later 1980s (10-12) that the connection of [[multi-angle laser light scattering]] (MALS) detectors to SEC systems was a practical proposition enabling both molar mass and size to be determined from each slice of the polymer fraction.

== Applications ==
Light scattering measurements can be applied to [[synthetic polymer]]s, [[protein]]s, [[pharmaceuticals]] and particles such as [[liposome]]s, [[micelles]], and encapsulated proteins. Measurements can be made in one of two modes which are [[un-fractionated]] (batch mode) or in [[continuous flow]] mode (with SEC, HPLC or any other [[flow fractionation method]]). Batch mode experiments can be performed either by injecting a sample into a flow cell with a syringe or with the use of discrete vials. These measurements are most often used to measure timed events like [[antibody-antigen reactions]] or [[protein assembly]]. Batch mode measurements can also be used to determine the second virial coefficient (A2), a value that gives a measure of the likelihood of crystallization or aggregation in a given solvent. Continuous flow experiments can be used to study material eluting from virtually any source.  More conventionally, the detectors are coupled to a variety of different chromatographic separation systems. The ability to determine the mass and size of the materials eluting then combines the advantage of the separation system with an absolute measurement of the mass and size of the species eluting.

The addition of an SLS detector coupled downstream to a chromatographic system allows the utility of SEC or similar separation combined with the advantage of an absolute detection method. The light scattering data is purely dependent on the light scattering signal times the concentration; the elution time is irrelevant and the separation can be changed for different samples without recalibration. In addition, a non-size separation method such as HPLC or IC can also be used.
As the light scattering detector is mass dependent, it becomes more sensitive as the molar mass increases. Thus it is an excellent tool for detecting aggregation. The higher the aggregation number, the more sensitive the detector becomes.

== Low-angle (laser)-light scattering (LALS) method ==

LALS measurements are measuring at a very low angle where the scattering vector is almost zero. LALS does not need any model to fit the angular dependence and hence is giving more reliable molecular weights measurements for large molecules.  LALS alone does not give any indication of the root mean square radius.

== Multi-angle (laser)-light scattering (MALS) method ==

MALS measurements work by calculating the amount of light scattered at each angle detected. The calculation is based on the intensity of light measured and the quantum efficiency of each detector.  Then a model is used to approximate the intensity of light scattered at zero angle. The zero angle light scattered is then related to the molar mass.

As previously noted, the MALS detector can also provide information about the size of the molecule. This information is the Root Mean Square radius of the molecule (RMS or Rg). This is different from the Rh mentioned above who is taking the hydration layer into account.  The purely mathematical root mean square radius is defined as the radii making up the molecule multiplied by the mass at that radius.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1056">'''Amakinite''' is a semi transparent yellow-green [[hydroxide]] [[mineral]] belonging to the [[brucite]] group that was discovered in 1962. Its [[chemical formula]] is written as (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mg)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It usually occurs in the form of splotchy, [[Euhedral and anhedral|anhedral]] [[crystals]] forming within a group or structure in other minerals or rocks, such as kimberlite. Its composition is as follows:
 
* Magnesium   5.82%  Mg    9.66% MgO
* Manganese   6.58%  Mn    8.50% MnO
* Iron       46.84%  Fe   60.26% FeO
* Hydrogen    2.42%  H    21.58% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Oxygen     38.34%  O

Amakinite is slightly magnetic and was named for the Amakin Expedition, which prospected the [[diamond]] deposits of [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]].

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].

== Physics ==

Inertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation "bubbles" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.

The vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.

The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work ''Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries''&lt;ref&gt;Logvinovich, GV (1969) Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries. Naukova dumka, Kiev, 215p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, RT, Daili, JW, Hammit, FG (1970) Cavitation. New York: Mc Graw Hill Book Company.  578p.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;Epshtein, LA (1970) Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels. Sudostroyenie , Leningrad, 208p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural continuation of these studies was recently presented in ''The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows''&lt;ref&gt;Terentiev, A, Kirschner, I, Uhlman, J, (2011) The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows. Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  – an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A. M. |year=2009 |title=A review of applications of cavitation in biochemical engineering/biotechnology |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=60–72 |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2008.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Chemical engineering===
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].

Use of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. --&gt;

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together. This effect may assist in [[protein folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/snap.html | website = Sandia National Laboratories | date = 2006-08-02 | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | title = Sandia researchers solve mystery of attractive surfaces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavitation also plays a role in [[HIFU]], a thermal non-invasive treatment methodology for [[cancer]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Old citation was for a research group at a University and it not appropriate|date=August 2018}}

Ultrasound sometimes is used to increase bone formation, for instance in post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhysioMontreal Article "Ultrasound".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound treatments or exposure can create cavitation that potentially may "result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada "Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II – Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110213842/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the sound of [[cracking joints|"cracking" knuckles]] derives from the collapse of cavitation in the synovial fluid within the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=A|author2=Dowson, D|author3=Wright, V|title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=July 1971|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–58|pmid=5557778|doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348|pmc=1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements that cause cracking expand the joint space, thus reducing pressure to the point of cavitation. It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis. Some physicians say that osteoarthritis is caused by cracking knuckles regularly, as this causes wear and tear and may cause the bone to weaken. The implication being that, it is not the "bubbles popping," but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

=== Food and beverage ===

==== Eggs ====
Cavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A. C. |first=Masters I. |doi=10.1177/0957650913477093 |year=2013 |title=Cavitation inception and simulation in blade element momentum theory for modelling tidal stream turbines |journal=Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=479–485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumps and propellers===
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

====Suction cavitation====
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

Common causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

====Discharge cavitation====
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

====Cavitation solutions====
Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.

To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pulp &amp; Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes&lt;/ref&gt;
To overcome cavitation:
Increase suction pressure if possible.
Decrease liquid temperature if possible.
Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.
Vent gases off the pump casing.

===Control valves===

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.

===Spillways===
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc. Intl. Symp. on Scale Effects in Modelling Hydraulic Structures, IAHR, Esslingen, Germany, H. KOBUS editor, paper 4.5 |year=1984 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name="Peterka_1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting." Joint Meeting Paper, IAHR/ASCE, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Aug. 1953, pp. 507–518 |year=1953 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the flow velocities near the spillway invert are sufficiently high, aerators (or aeration devices) must be introduced to prevent cavitation. Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989a"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301–319 (ISSN 0022-1686)  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989b"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high flow velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

===Engines===
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

===Geology===
Some hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.

The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat. Rising magma, filled with dissolved gasses and under immense pressure, encountered a different magma that compressed easily, allowing bubbles to grow and combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html|title=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.

===Vascular plants===
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., &amp; Tyree, M.T., 1996. New evidence for large negative xylem pressures and their measurement by the pressure chamber technique. 'Plant Cell Environ.' 19: 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. This primarily occurs near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is low.

Cavitation may limit the maximum swimming speed of powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are painful. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings and do not feel pain from cavitation. They are slowed down when cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name="IosilevskiiWeihs2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=20|year=2008|pages=329–338|issn=1742-5689|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea animals have found ways to use cavitation to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thresher sharks]] use 'tail slaps' to debilitate their small fish prey and cavitation bubbles have been seen rising from the apex of the tail arc.&lt;ref name="TsiklirasOliver2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsikliras|first1=Athanassios C.|last2=Oliver|first2=Simon P.|last3=Turner|first3=John R.|last4=Gann|first4=Klemens|last5=Silvosa|first5=Medel|last6=D'Urban Jackson|first6=Tim|title=Thresher Sharks Use Tail-Slaps as a Hunting Strategy|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=7|year=2013|pages=e67380|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067380|pmid=23874415|pmc=3707734|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...867380O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHoCCPsRuhg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal erosion===
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=978-0-444-89830-2 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded. Varying pressure decompresses some vapor pockets which subsequently implode. The resulting pressure peaks can blast apart fractions of the rock.

'''Cirrus floccus''' is a type of [[cirrus cloud]].

'''Cogeneration''' or '''combined heat and power''' ('''CHP''') is the use of a [[heat engine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ Cogeneration and Cogeneration Schematic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209230320/http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ |date=2013-12-09 }}, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 26.11.11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[power station]] to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time. '''Trigeneration''' or '''combined cooling, heat and power''' ('''CCHP''') refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector. The terms ''cogeneration'' and ''trigeneration'' can be also applied to the power systems generating simultaneously electricity, heat, and industrial chemicals – e.g., [[syngas]] or pure [[hydrogen]] (article: [[combined cycle]]s, chapter: [[Combined cycle#Natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle|natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle]]).

Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel because otherwise wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants recover otherwise wasted [[thermal energy]] for [[HVAC#heating|heating]]. This is also called combined heat and power district heating. Small CHP plants are an example of [[Distributed generation|decentralized energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|title=What is Decentralised Energy?|publisher=The Decentralised Energy Knowledge Base|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210123230/http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|archivedate=2008-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By-product heat at moderate temperatures (100–180&amp;nbsp;°C, 212–356&amp;nbsp;°F) can also be used in [[absorption refrigerator]]s for cooling.

The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a [[gas turbine|gas]] or [[steam turbine]]-powered generator. The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating. At smaller scales (typically below 1 MW) a [[gas engine]] or [[diesel engine]] may be used. Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the [[waste heat]] is used for both heating and cooling, typically in an absorption refrigerator. Combined cooling, heat and power systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants. In the United States, the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling, heating and power. Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction.

Cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation. Before central stations distributed power, industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating. Large office and apartment buildings, hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat. Due to the high cost of early purchased power, these CHP operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
[[File:Masnedø power station.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Masnedø]] CHP power station in [[Denmark]]. This station burns straw as fuel. The adjacent greenhouses are heated by [[district heating]] from the plant.]]

Many process industries, such as chemical plants, oil refineries and pulp and paper mills, require large amounts of process heat for such operations as chemical reactors, distillation columns, steam driers and other uses. This heat, which is usually used in the form of steam, can be generated at the typically low pressures used in heating, or can be generated at much higher pressure and passed through a turbine first to generate electricity. In the turbine the steam pressure and temperature is lowered as the internal energy of the steam is converted to work. The lower pressure steam leaving the turbine can then be used for process heat.&lt;!--[[Thermal power plants]] (those that are based on a [[thermodynamic cycle]] to convert heat produced from [[Concentrated solar power|solar mirrors]], [[uranium|fissile elements]], burning [[coal]], [[petroleum]], or [[natural gas]]), and [[heat engine]]s in general, do not convert all of their thermal energy into electricity. In most heat engines, more than half is lost as excess [[heat]] (see: [[Second law of thermodynamics]] and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]]). By capturing the excess heat, CHP uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional [[power plant]], potentially reaching an [[thermal efficiency|efficiency]] of up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/distributedenergy/pdfs/chp_report_12-08.pdf|title=Combined Heat and Power – Effective Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=9 September 2011 |date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy.--&gt;

Steam turbines at [[thermal power station]]s are normally designed to be fed high pressure steam, which exits the turbine at a condenser operating a few degrees above ambient temperature and at a few millimeters of mercury absolute pressure. (This is called a ''condensing'' turbine.) For all practical purposes this steam has negligible useful energy before it is condensed. Steam turbines for cogeneration are designed either for ''extraction'' of some steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages, with the un-extracted steam going on through the turbine to a condenser. In this case, the extracted steam causes a mechanical [[power loss factor|power loss]] in the downstream stages of the turbine. Or they are designed, with or without extraction, for final exhaust at ''back pressure'' (non-condensing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|title=Consider Installing High-Pressure Boilers With Back Pressure Turbine-Generators|author=|date=|website=nrel.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221120102/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Steam-its generation and use |last= |first= |authorlink= |year= |publisher =Babcock &amp; Wilcox |location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating. Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of [[enthalpy]] that could be used for power generation, so cogeneration has an opportunity cost.

A typical power generation turbine in a [[paper mill]] may have extraction pressures of 160 psig (1.103 MPa) and 60 psig (0.41 MPa). A typical back pressure may be 60 psig (0.41 MPa). In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility. Conversely, simply generating process steam for industrial purposes instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost (See: [[Steam turbine#Steam supply and exhaust conditions|Steam supply and exhaust conditions]]). The capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers, turbines and generators are substantial. This equipment is normally operated [[Continuous production|continuously]], which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.

[[File:Metz biomass power station.jpg|thumb|left|A cogeneration plant in [[Metz]], [[France]]. The 45MW boiler uses waste wood [[biomass]] as energy source, and provides electricity and heat for 30,000 [[dwelling]]s.]]

A [[combined cycle]] (in which several thermodynamic cycles produce electricity), may also be used to extract heat using a heating system as [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] of the power plant's [[bottoming cycle]]. For example, the RU-25 [[MHD generator]] in [[Moscow]] heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant, whose condensate was then used for space heat. A more modern system might use a [[gas turbine]] powered by [[natural gas]], whose exhaust powers a steam plant, whose condensate provides heat. Cogeneration plants based on a combined cycle power unit can have thermal efficiencies above 80%.

The viability of CHP (sometimes termed utilisation factor), especially in smaller CHP installations, depends on a good baseload of operation, both in terms of an on-site (or near site) electrical demand and heat demand. In practice, an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat (''heat driven operation'') or be run as a [[power plant]] with some use of its waste heat, the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency. The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for trigeneration exist. In such cases, the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an [[absorption chiller]].

CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances. This requires heavily insulated pipes, which are expensive and inefficient; whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire, and over much longer distances for the same energy loss.

A car engine becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle. The example illustrates the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine.

Thermally [[enhanced oil recovery]] (TEOR) plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity. After generating electricity, these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily, increasing production. TEOR cogeneration plants in [[Kern County, California]] produce so much electricity that it cannot all be used locally and is transmitted to [[Los Angeles]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

CHP is one of the most cost-efficient methods of reducing carbon emissions from heating systems in cold climates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|title=Carbon footprints of various sources of heat – biomass combustion and CHPDH comes out lowest|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005102349/http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy from fossil fuels or biomass into electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|title=Cogeneration recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy|publisher=Viessmann|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808225555/http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|archivedate=2016-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cogeneration plants are commonly found in [[district heating]] systems of cities, [[central heating]] systems of larger buildings (e.g. hospitals, hotels, prisons) and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water, cooling, steam production or [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] fertilization.

==Types of plants==
Topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine. Partly expanded steam is then condensed in a heating condensor at a temperature level that is suitable e.g. [[district heating]] or [[water desalination]].

[[Bottoming cycle]] plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes, then a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler feeds an electrical plant. Bottoming cycle plants are only used in industrial processes that require very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing, so they are less common.

Large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town. Common CHP plant types are:
* [[Gas turbine]] CHP plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines. The fuel used is typically [[natural gas]].
* [[Gas engine]] CHP plants use a reciprocating gas engine which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about 5 MW. The gaseous fuel used is normally [[natural gas]]. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's gas supply, electrical distribution network and heating systems. Typical outputs and efficiences see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|title=Finning Caterpillar Gas Engine CHP Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094951/http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical large example see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|title=Complete 7 MWe Deutz ( 2 x 3.5MWe) gas engine CHP power plant for sale|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930042456/http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|archivedate=2013-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biofuel|Biofuel engine]] CHP plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or [[diesel engine]], depending upon which biofuel is being used, and are otherwise very similar in design to a Gas engine CHP plant. The advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced [[hydrocarbon fuel]] consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's electrical distribution and heating systems. Another variant is the [[wood gasifier]] CHP plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is [[gasified]] in a zero oxygen high temperature environment; the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine. Typical smaller size biogas plant see &lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html|title=38% HHV Caterpillar Bio-gas Engine Fitted to Sewage Works - Claverton Group|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102053132/http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Combined cycle]] power plants adapted for CHP
* [[Molten-carbonate fuel cell]]s and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s have a hot exhaust, very suitable for heating.
* [[Steam turbine]] CHP plants that use the heating system as the [[steam]] condenser for the steam turbine.
* [[Nuclear power]] [[Nuclear power plant|plants]], similar to other steam turbine power plants, can be fitted with extractions in the turbines to bleed partially expanded steam to a heating system. With a heating system temperature of 95&amp;nbsp;°C it is possible to extract about 10 MW heat for every MW electricity lost. With a temperature of 130&amp;nbsp;°C the gain is slightly smaller, about 7 MW for every MWe lost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elforsk.se/nyhet/seminarie/Elforskdagen%20_10/webb_varme/d_welander.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [swedish]&lt;/ref&gt; A review of cogeneration options is in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Fiordaliso|first2=Andrea|last3=Boarin|first3=Sara|last4=Ricotti|first4=Marco E.|date=2017-05-01|title=Cogeneration: An option to facilitate load following in Small Modular Reactors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014919701630292X|journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy|volume=97|pages=153–161|doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2016.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller cogeneration units may use a [[reciprocating engine]] or [[Stirling engine]]. The heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator. The systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants.

Some cogeneration plants are fired by [[biomass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf|title=High cogeneration performance by innovative steam turbine for biomass-fired CHP plant in Iislami, Finland|publisher=OPET|accessdate=13 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113827/http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or industrial and [[municipal solid waste]] (see [[incineration]]). Some CHP plants utilize waste gas as the fuel for electricity and heat generation. Waste gases can be gas from [[animal waste]], [[landfill gas]], [[Firedamp|gas from coal mines]], [[sewage gas]], and combustible industrial waste gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transforming Greenhouse Gas Emissions into Energy|journal=WIPO Green Case Studies, 2014|date=2014|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_951_3.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413090614/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_951_3.pdf|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroCHP===
[[Micro combined heat and power]] or 'Micro cogeneration" is a so-called [[Distributed Energy Resource|distributed energy resource]] (DER). The installation is usually less than 5 [[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|kW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] in a house or small business. Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water, some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat. This electricity can be used within the home or business or, if permitted by the grid management, sold back into the electric power grid.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414152813/http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 20.000 units were sold in [[Japan]] in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project.

===Combined heat and power district heating===
{{See also|District heating}}

In the [[United States]], [[Consolidated Edison]] distributes 66 billion kilograms of 350&amp;nbsp;°F (180&amp;nbsp;°C) steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to 100,000 buildings in [[Manhattan]]—the biggest steam district in the United States. The peak delivery is 10 million pounds per hour (or approximately 2.5 GW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Newsroom: Steam| publisher =ConEdison| url =http://www.coned.com/newsroom/energysystems_steam.asp| accessdate =2007-07-20| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070821132012/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/energysystems_steam.asp| archivedate =2007-08-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Bevelhymer| first =Carl| title =Steam| publisher =Gotham Gazette| date =2003-11-10| url =http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674| accessdate =2007-07-20| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070813013416/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674| archivedate =2007-08-13| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial CHP===
Cogeneration is still common in [[pulp and paper mill]]s, refineries and chemical plants. In this "industrial cogeneration/CHP", the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures (above 100 deg C) and used for process steam or drying duties. This is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat, but there is a slight loss of power generation. The increased focus on [[sustainability]] has made industrial CHP more attractive, as it substantially reduces [[carbon footprint]] compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid.

====Utility pressures versus self generated industrial====
Industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.

===Heat recovery steam generators===
A [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) is a steam boiler that uses hot [[exhaust gas]]es from the [[gas turbine]]s or [[reciprocating engine]]s in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate [[steam]]. The steam, in turn, drives a [[steam turbine]] or is used in industrial processes that require heat.

HRSGs used in the CHP industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features:
* The HRSG is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to.
* Since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low, heat transmission is accomplished mainly through [[convection]].
* The exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down. Thus, the transmission coefficient is low, which calls for a large heating surface area.
* Since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated (steam or water) is low, and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well, the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers.

==Comparison with a heat pump==
A [[heat pump]] may be compared with a CHP unit as follows. If, to supply thermal energy, the exhaust steam from the turbo-generator must be taken at a higher temperature than the system would produce most electricity at, the lost electrical generation is ''as if'' a heat pump were used to provide the same heat by taking electrical power from the generator running at lower output temperature and higher efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|title=Why Heat From CHP is Renewable - based on paper presented at IAEE Vilnius (2010)|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=4 paragraph 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921204903/http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically for every unit of electrical power lost, then about 6 units of heat are made available at about 90&amp;nbsp;°C. Thus CHP has an effective [[Coefficient of performance|Coefficient of Performance (COP)]] compared to a heat pump of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.007| title = Combined heat and power considered as a virtual steam cycle heat pump| year = 2011| last1 = Lowe | first1 = R. | journal = Energy Policy| volume = 39| issue = 9| pages = 5528–5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for a remotely operated heat pump, losses in the electrical distribution network would need to be considered, of the order of 6%. Because the losses are proportional to the square of the current, during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread (i.e. citywide application of heat pumps) would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they were substantially reinforced.

It is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump, where the excess electricity (as heat demand is the defining factor on utilization) is used to drive a heat pump. As heat demand increases, more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump, with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid.

==Distributed generation==
Most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output. These plants benefit from economy of scale, but may need to transmit electricity across long distances causing transmission losses. Cogeneration or trigeneration production is subject to limitations in the local demand, and thus may sometimes need to reduce e.g. heat or cooling production to match the demand. An example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the [[New York City steam system]].

==Thermal efficiency==
Every heat engine is subject to the theoretical efficiency limits of the [[Carnot cycle]] or subset [[Rankine cycle]] in the case of steam turbine power plants or [[Brayton cycle]] in gas turbine with steam turbine plants. Most of the efficiency loss with steam power generation is associated with the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] of steam that is not recovered when a turbine exhausts its low temperature and pressure steam to a condenser. (Typical steam to condenser would be at a few millimeters absolute pressure and on the order of 5&amp;nbsp;°C/11&amp;nbsp;°F hotter than the cooling water temperature, depending on the condenser capacity.) In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat, building heat or cooling with an [[absorption chiller]]. The majority of this heat is from the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] when the steam condenses.

[[Thermal efficiency]] in a cogeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Heat output may be used also for cooling (for example in Summer), thanks to an absorption chiller.
If cooling is achieved in the same time, [[Thermal efficiency]] in a trigeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output + Cooling output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Typical cogeneration models have losses as in any system. The energy distribution below is represented as a percent of total input energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trigeneration Systems with Fuel Cells|url=http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|work=Research Paper|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006064857/http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Electricity = 45%
:Heat + Cooling = 40%
:Heat losses = 13%
:Electrical line losses = 2%

Conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert about 33-45% of their input heat to electricity.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095840/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt;  [[Brayton cycle]] power plants operate at up to 60% efficiency. In the case of conventional power plants approximately 10-15% of this heat is lost up the stack of the boiler, most of the remaining heat emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses so it is usually rejected to the environment, typically to cooling water passing through a condenser.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; Because turbine exhaust is normally just above ambient temperature, some potential power generation is sacrificed in rejecting higher temperature steam from the turbine for cogeneration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See Mechanical or Chemical Engineering texts on Thermodynamics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For cogeneration to be practical power generation and end use of heat must be in relatively close proximity (&lt;2 KM typically).
Even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant, the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as 80%.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; This provides substantial financial and environmental benefits.

==Costs==
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source}}
Typically, for a gas-fired plant the fully installed cost per kW electrical is around £400/kW ($577 USD), which is comparable with large central power stations.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"/&gt;

==History==

===Cogeneration in Europe===
[[File:Power plant at sunset.jpg|thumb|220px|A cogeneration thermal power plant in [[Ferrera Erbognone]] ([[Province of Pavia|PV]]), [[Italy]]]]

The [[European Union|EU]] has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the [[CHP Directive]]. In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament’s Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, “security of supply really starts with energy efficiency.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf |title =Energy Efficiency Industrial Forum Position Paper: energy efficiency – a vital component of energy security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union’s Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC. This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country. The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances.

The European Union generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|title=2011 - Cogen -Experts discuss the central role cogeneration has to play in shaping EU energy policy|author=|date=|website=cogeneurope.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620044706/http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is large difference between Member States with variations of the energy savings between 2% and 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world’s most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf |title=COGEN Europe: Cogeneration in the European Union’s Energy Supply Security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 28.46 TWh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in Finland in 2012, 81.80% was cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |title=Electricity Generation by Energy Source |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220125742/http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency. Germany reported that at present, over 50% of the country’s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration. So far, Germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5% of the country’s electricity to 25% of the country’s electricity by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KWKG 2002|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095900/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also actively supporting combined heat and power. In light of UK’s goal to achieve a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the government has set the target to source at least 15% of its government electricity use from CHP by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |title=DEFRA Action in the UK - Combined Heat and Power |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612100647/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives, grant support, a greater regulatory framework, and government leadership and partnership.

According to the IEA 2008 modeling of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, the expansion of cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe’s savings from today’s 155.69 Twh to 465 Twh in 2030. It would also result in a 16% to 29% increase in each country’s total cogenerated electricity by 2030.

Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like [[COGEN Europe]] who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe’s energy policy. COGEN is Europe’s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry.

===Cogeneration in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the ''Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance'' scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power. It was introduced in 1996. It defines, through calculation of inputs and outputs, "Good Quality CHP" in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity. Compliance with Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk|title=Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance Programme|author=|date=|website=decc.gov.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030232902/http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk/|archivedate=30 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cogeneration in the United States===
[[File:Mirant Kendall Cogeneration Station.jpg|thumb|right|The 250 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Kendall Cogeneration Station]] plant in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]]]

Perhaps the first modern use of [[energy recycling]] was done by [[Thomas Edison]]. His 1882 [[Pearl Street Station]], the world’s first commercial power plant, was a combined heat and power plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425015724/http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|archivedate=2008-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities. These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as cogeneration.

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers.

Cogeneration plants proliferated, soon producing about 8% of all energy in the United States.&lt;ref name=localpower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localpower.org/documents/report_worldsurvey06.pdf|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy|date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[United States Department of Energy]] has an aggressive goal of having CHP constitute
20% of generation capacity by the year 2030.

The focus of the Application Centers is to provide an outreach and technology deployment program for end users, policy makers, utilities, and industry stakeholders.

High electric rates in New England and the Middle Atlantic make these areas of the United States the most beneficial for cogeneration.&lt;ref name=electricitydata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a|title=Electricity Data|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531215733/http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a|archivedate=2015-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=energysaving&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newenglandcondo.com/articles/773/1/Energy-Saving-Incentives/Page1.html|title=New England Energy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123213042/http://newenglandcondo.com/articles/773/1/Energy-Saving-Incentives/Page1.html|archivedate=2015-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collapsus''' is a project that combines [[animation]], interactive fiction, and [[documentary film]].&lt;ref name=Filmthreat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Mark|title=CHECK OUT FILMMAKER TOMMY PALLOTTA’S NEW TRANSMEDIA PROJECT "COLLAPSUS"|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/news/26619/|website=Filmthreat|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story follows how the impending [[energy crisis]] affects ten young people, while international powers battle with political dissension and a fearful population during transition from [[Fossil fuel]] to alternative fuels.&lt;ref name=Filmthreat /&gt; Set in the near future, Collapsus was initialized to raise awareness of the [[global issue]] of [[peak oil]].

== Content ==

The project combines [[Video blogging]], interactive maps, fictional newscasts, live action footage, and animation to immerse the player in the narrative, an example of [[Transmedia storytelling]]. The project requires the player to access and assess additional information and make decisions about the world's energy production at both a national and global scale.

== Production ==

Collapsus was developed by Submarine Channel, with the Dutch public broadcaster [[VPRO]], who produced the associated Energy Transition documentary the project is based on. Collapsus is directed by [[Tommy Pallotta]], who produced  [[A Scanner Darkly (film)]] and [[Waking Life]].&lt;ref name=Peakoil&gt;{{cite web|title=Collapsus, Transmedia, The Energy Risk Conspiracy|url=http://peakoil.com/generalideas/collapsus-transmedia-the-energy-risk-conspiracy|website=Peakoil|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collapsus blends live action and the [[rotoscoping]] animation technique, co-developed by Pallotta, and used in [[Waking Life]]  and [[A Scanner Darkly (film)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3421">{{for|an [[anti-Soviet]] organization in the [[Georgian SSR]] with a similar name|Committee for Independence of Georgia}}
The '''Committee of Independent Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|დამოუკიდებელი საქართველოს კომიტეტი}}), also known as the '''Georgian Committee''', was a political organization formed in 1914 by [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] émigrés and students in [[German Empire|Germany]] during [[World War I]]. It aimed at ending [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]n rule in Georgia and reasserting the country’s independence under German protection. The Committee was chaired by Petre Surguladse; other members included [[Georges V. Matchabelli|Prince Georges Matchabelli]], [[Mikheil Tsereteli]] (a notable scholar who had abandoned [[Kropotkin]]ite [[Anarchism]] in favor of Georgian nationalism), [[Leo Kereselidze|Leo]] and Giorgi Kereselidze, and the [[Muslim]] Georgian Osman Bey (Meliton) Kartsivadze. The Committee also established branches in [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

During the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of 1916–7, the Committee was headquartered in [[Samsun]], and later in [[Kerasunt]]. From there, the organization attempted to establish contacts with dissidents in Georgia. The leading independent political party, the [[Georgian Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party|Social Democrats]] ([[Mensheviks]]), maintained neutrality and did not engage in antiwar activity. Their expressed Russian orientation convinced the Tsarist authorities to allow them to operate freely in the [[Caucasus]]. Thus the Mensheviks were reluctant to collaborate with the Committee, which advocated a break with Russia and an independent Georgian state. Mikheil Tsereteli himself made a secret trip to Georgia (landing from a German [[submarine]] ''[[SM UB-42]]''). He met with the Menshevik leader [[Noe Zhordania]] at [[Kutaisi]], and urged him to consider a pro-German orientation. But at that time, Zhordania considered any confrontation with the Tsarist administration political suicide and Tsereteli’s mission ended unsuccessfully. Yet the Committee and its supporters, although not very numerous, represented quite a serious problem for the Russian government, especially after the Committee established a volunteer unit, the [[The Georgian Legion (1914-1918)|Georgian Legion]], as part of the [[German Caucasus Expedition]]. Although the movement continued to be backed by Germany, its relations with the Ottoman government became extremely strained. As a result, the Georgian Legion was officially disbanded in April 1917. The members of both the Committee and the Legion returned to Georgia after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and joined the independence movement that concluded with the proclamation of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] on May 26, 1918.

==Nature of the Material==
[[Wood]] is a vascular material that comes from the trunk, roots, or stems of over 3,000 varieties of plants..&lt;ref&gt;Wood. (n.d.). In Cameo. Retrieved April 07, 2018, from http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Wood&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cellular tissue and therefore can be understood by looking into the biological structure. &lt;ref&gt; Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Cell Structure===
Wood is porous and its growth is directional. This is due to the cellular structure of the material. Cellular structure determines factors such as grain, texture, and color. &lt;ref&gt; Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt;. Identification of wood types is undertaken by a [[conservation scientist]].
====Grain====
Wood grain is created by the variations in number and arrangement of cells. It specifically refers to the longitudinal alignment of cells, or the direction in which the fibers are going. &lt;ref&gt; Dorge, V., &amp; Howlett, F. C. (1998). Painted Wood: History and conservation: Proceedings of a symposium organized by the Wooden Artifacts Group of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works and the Foundation of the AIC, held at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, 11-14 November 1994. Los Angeles (California): The Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The six types of grain are: straight, irregular, diagonal, spiral, interlocked, and wavy. The directional of the grain directly corresponds with the strength of the wood. &lt;ref&gt; Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt;.

====Texture====
Texture is dependent on the dimensions of the vessels that make up the wood. Large vessels result in course wood, while small vessels result in a fine texture. &lt;ref&gt; Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt;.

====Color====
[[Color]] is determined by the infiltrates in the cell walls of the wood. Infiltrates can be affected by light, air, and heat which cause chemical reactions within the cell wall. These chemical reactions are what give the wood its color or what lead to a change in the wood’s color. &lt;ref&gt; Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of Wooden Artifacts==
===Joinery===
Joinery refers to any way that two separate components are put together. Joinery in regards to wood can take the form of any of the following:

*Widening joints
*Angle joints
*Framing joints- join two pieces of wood at a right angle
**Dovetailing
**Mortise and tenon
*Edge Joints- join two pieces of wood along the long edges of the board&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Construction Techniques for Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects (n.d.). Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/fundconst.html&lt;/ref&gt;
**Glue
**Tongue and Groove
*Spline Joints-Lengthen wooden boards
*Mitre and dowel joint		
*Hardware
See [[Woodworking joints]]

The success of joinery depends on the join chosen, the grain direction of joined parts, the amount of stresses imposed, wood movement in regards to moisture, and the surface quality of joins.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; If any one of these factors is compromised then the join is not as strong as it could be.

===Surfaces===
Wooden objects are often coated a surface protection or ornamentation. The following are common examples of surface treatments for wooden artifacts:
*[[Inlay]]
*[[Paint]]
*[[Varnish]]
*[[Gilding]]
*[[Lacquer]]

==Agents of Deterioration==

===Humidity===
[[Humidity]] influences the deterioration of wooden artifacts through due to too much moisture in the air, too little moisture in the air, or rapid fluctuations in moisture. Because of the composition of wood, careful control of humidity is a factor in preventive conservation. If the [[relative humidity]] is too low the wood will release some of its moisture into the air and dry out.  Conversely, if the relative humidity is too high, the wood absorbs water from the air and expands. Rapid fluctuations in humidity can lead to warping, loosening of joints, and splitting. High levels of moisture in the air also create an environment that encourages biological deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weathering===
[[Weathering]] related to the damage of objects caused by the exposure to wind, rain, sunshine, snow, or any other natural occurrence. These natural phenomenon erode away at the surface of the wood, causing damage to surfaces and structure.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical Agents===
Chemical deterioration is caused by any agent that creates a chemical reaction within the cellular structure of the wood. The five common chemical agents that damage wood are:
*Light- Creates a chemical reaction within the cell walls of wood, leading to a change in color or texture
*[[Acids]]- Cause wood to become brittle.
*[[Alkalies]]- Cause the fibers of the wood to separate and break down.
*[[Salts]]- Similar to alkalies, salts break down the fibers of wood.
*[[Fire]]- Wood is a flammable material that burns easily in most cases when exposed to fire.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological Agents===
Biological deterioration in regards to wooden artifacts is caused by mainly by [[Insects]] and [[Fungi]] eating away at the surface of the material, which can lead to further problems if left untreated.&lt;ref&gt;Biological Deterioration &amp; Damage to Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects. (n.d.). Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html&lt;/ref&gt;
====Insects====
Insects damage wooden artifacts by feeding on the organic material, leaving waste behind, or tunneling into the wood. Insect damage can be controlled by understanding their life cycle and needs. Because they rely on environment to regulate their body temperatures, insects will slow down activity the colder the temperature is and will not breed or develop if temperatures are under 50 degrees Fahrenheit, or 10 degrees Celsius. Aside from requiring high temperatures, insects also thrive on environments with high levels of relative humidity. Wooden artifacts can provide just the right environment for insects to feed, tunnel, breed, and reproduce, leading to a variety of damages to the wood, including, boring holes, waste material, chew marks, and exit holes.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fungi====
Fungi cause damage to wooden artifacts by eating away at the wood and causing it to rot. Growth occurs on wooden artifacts when the environment is damp due to high levels of humidity and poor ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Pests====
*[[Birds]]- Mainly, [[woodpeckers]], will cause damage to wooden objects left outdoors
*[[Marine Life| Marine Organisms]]- Can be problematic for artifacts that have recently been recovered from a maritime environment.
*[[Rodents]]- Will naw at the surface of wooden objects to obtain food. This is mainly a problem for objects that were once storage vessels.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventive Conservation==
Preventive conservation is a form of [[Collections care]] that acts to prevent damage to artifacts. This type of conservation can be undertaken by any person who is trained as a [[Collection manager]], [[registrar (museum)|registrar]], [[art handler]], or conservator.

===Environmental Control===
One of the most basic forms of preventive conservation is through environmental control, which includes the regulation of temperature, humidity, and light. Through environmental control, most forms of deterioration to wooden artifacts can be prevented relatively easily.&lt;ref&gt;Biological Deterioration &amp; Damage to Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects. (n.d.). Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html &lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperature====
[[Temperature]] affects wooden objects through its correlation with humidity. Generally lower temperatures reduce the amount of moisture in the air, while higher temperatures increase the amount of moisture in the air. As such, recommended temperature for storage and display of wooden artifacts is 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the winter months and 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humidity====
Recommended relative humidity for storage and display of wooden artifacts during the winter months is 35%-45% and 55%-65% during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Any percentage above 70 can lead to fungi or insect infestations.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Careful control of relative humidity can reduce the risk of damage caused by loss or absorption of water. Equipment that can help in the regulation of humidity is air conditioning, a humidifier or dehumidifier depending on needs, or by implementing [[Humidity buffering|RH buffers]]. &lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light====
[[Light]] can cause cumulative damage to wooden artifacts, leading to discoloration of the surface. Long exposure to light can result in darkening of light woods and bleaching of dark woods.&lt;ref&gt;Wood and furniture. (2016, May 13). Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/wood-and-furniture &lt;/ref&gt; Infra red radiation and heat from light can also damage any finishes to the object, causing cracking of paint or varnish, brittleness, or softening of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the damage inflicted by light, it is recommended that the three following steps be taken:
*Eliminate [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]]- This can be done simply by keeping objects out of direct sunlight and displaying them behind UV filtering [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]].
*Reduce the amount of time the object is exposed to light- Most cultural institutions limit the amount of time a light sensitive object is on display by rotating it in and out of the galleries. Light exposure can also be controlled by having motion activated lights with timers, so objects are only illuminated when visitors are present and then only for a short amount of time. 
*Keep light at minimal light levels comfortable for viewing-When an object is illuminated for viewers, it should be lit at the minimum level for comfortable viewing.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
With wooden artifacts exposed to open air, it is important to remove particulates from the object’s surface on a regular basis. The buildup of particulates can result in biological deterioration, encourage the growth of micro-organisms, and impair the qualities of an object's surface. Regular cleaning can reduce the long-term damage caused by the build-up of particulates.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic and effective method for regular cleaning of wooden artifacts is to dust off the surface with a dry cotton cloth. &lt;ref&gt;Basic care – Furniture and objects made of wood. (2017, September 15). Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/furniture-wooden-objects/basic-care-furniture-objects-wood.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
Wooden artifacts should be kept out of direct sunlight and in a space where they will not get bumped or jostled around.

===Pest Eradication===
Treatment for ridding wooden artifacts of insects usually involves a combination of the following techniques:
*Insecticidal treatment- Insecticides can be placed directly on areas of an object, or be used to treat large areas within the space where the objects are housed
*Temperature-based treatment- Since insects need specific temperatures to thrive, placing objects in a freezer that is -25 to -30 degrees Celsius for three days will kill off any remaining insects. Alternatively, placing objects in a space that is heated to 50 degrees Celius for an hour will also kill all stages of insect growth.
*Low oxygen atmospheres-Keeping wooden artifacts in an air-tight space filled with nitrogen or argon for a 21-day period will end the insect life cycle and can be used as an alternative to pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, S., &amp; Umney, N. (2013). Conservation of Furniture. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object Treatment==
===Surface Cleaning===
Surface cleaning refers to the removal of particulates from the surface of an object. To clean the surface of wooden artifacts, conservators generally use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush. If wet surface cleaning is necessary, a dilute detergent can be applied with the use of a cotton swab or soft cotton cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drying===
If a wooden artifact has sustained water damage, then the object must be dried slowly so as not to cause splitting of the wood as it dries. Similar to relative humidity, a rapid fluctuation in moisture from water damage can cause further damage to wooden objects. Slow controlled drying can be achieved by lower the relative humidity and creating a tent for the artifact so that it does not lose moisture too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation===
If a wooden object has been damaged by insects or fungi, one treatment method is to consolidate the damaged fibers using a liquid resin or solvent to strengthen the material. This method can lead to visual changes in the object and is not always reversible.&lt;ref&gt;United States, National Park Service. (2002). National Park Service Handbook; Appendix N: Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects. Retrieved March 29, 2018, from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Consolidation can also refer to the treatment of painted wood surfaces. Because of the complicated nature of wood as a material, consolidation of paint on a wooden artifact must be carefully undertaken. As wood expands and contracts with fluctuations in temperature and humidity, damages can occur to paint on the wood's surface.

===Structural Repair===
Structural repair to wooden artifacts, as with the conservation of any artifact, should be as unobtrusive as possible. One method for mending separated pieces of wooden artifacts is the use of hot or liquid hide glue.&lt;ref&gt;Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; To reverse warping of wooden artifacts, conservators often treat artifacts using pressure. Treatment methods can be broken down into three categories: Direct Woodworking, Indirect Woodworking, and Moisture-Related Methods. &lt;ref&gt;Warped Wood. (n.d.). Retrieved April 13, 2018, from http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Warped_Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35078">[[Heat exchanger]]s are devices that transfer [[heat]] in order to achieve desired heating or cooling. An important design aspect of heat exchanger technology is the selection of appropriate materials to conduct and transfer heat fast and efficiently.

[[Copper]] has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable [[heat exchangers]]. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] allows heat to pass through it quickly. Other desirable properties of '''copper in heat exchangers''' include its [[corrosion]] resistance, [[biofouling]] resistance, maximum allowable stress and internal pressure, creep rupture strength, [[fatigue strength]], [[hardness]], [[thermal expansion]], [[specific heat]], [[antimicrobial]] properties, [[tensile strength]], [[yield strength]], high [[melting point]], [[alloy]]ability, ease of fabrication, and ease of joining.

The combination of these properties enable copper to be specified for heat exchangers in industrial facilities, HVAC systems, vehicular coolers and radiators, and as [[heat sink]]s to cool [[computer]]s, [[disk drive]]s, [[television]]s, computer monitors, and other electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Schoolscience.co.uk; Resources and news for science education; supported by Research Councils UK; http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/cda/14-16/chemistry/copch0pg4.html&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is also incorporated into the bottoms of high-quality [[Cookware and bakeware#Cookware materials#Copper|cookware]] because the metal conducts heat quickly and distributes it evenly.

Non-copper heat exchangers are also available. Some alternative materials include [[aluminium]], [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[List of alloys|nickel alloys]], and [[titanium]].

This article focuses on beneficial properties and common applications of copper in heat exchangers.  New copper heat exchanger technologies for specific applications are also introduced.

==History==
Heat exchangers using copper and its alloys have evolved along with heat transfer technologies over the past several hundred years. Copper condenser tubes were first used in 1769 for [[steam engine]]s. Initially, the tubes were made of unalloyed copper. By 1870, [[Muntz metal]], a 60% Cu-40% Zn [[brass]] alloy, was used for condensers in seawater cooling. Admiralty metal, a 70% Cu-30% Zn yellow brass alloy with 1% [[tin]] added to improve corrosion resistance, was introduced in 1890 for seawater service.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gaffoglio, Carl J., Copper alloy surface condenser tube application and service considerations; CDA Heat Exchange Seminars; Copper Development Association&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, a 70% Cu-30% Ni alloy was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% [[manganese]] and 2% [[iron]] copper alloy was introduced for better erosion resistance. A 90% Cu-10% Ni alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping. This alloy is now the most widely used copper-nickel alloy in marine heat exchangers.

Today, steam, evaporator, and condenser coils are made from copper and copper alloys.&lt;ref name="srcoils.com"&gt;Steam coils; Super Radiator Coils; Replacement coils brochure: http://www.srcoils.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/05/Super-Replacement-Coils-2010-web.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These heat exchangers are used in [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] systems, industrial and central heating and cooling systems, [[radiator]]s, [[hot water tank]]s, and under-floor heating systems.

Copper-based heat exchangers can be manufactured with copper tube/aluminium fin, cupro-nickel, or all-copper constructions. Various coatings can be applied to enhance corrosion resistance of the tubes and fins.&lt;ref name="srcoils.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;10 tips on getting the most from your coil; Super Radiator Coils; http://www.srcoils.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/05/T003-10-Tips.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficial properties of copper heat exchangers==

===Thermal conductivity===
Thermal conductivity (k, also denoted as λ or κ) is a measure of a material's ability to conduct [[heat conduction|heat]]. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs at a higher rate than across materials of low thermal conductivity. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m•K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or [[Imperial units]]), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr•ft⋅F).

Copper has a thermal conductivity of 231 Btu/(hr-ft-F). This is higher than all other metals except [[silver]], a [[precious metal]]. Copper has a 60% better thermal conductivity rating than aluminium and a 3,000% better rating than stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;Materials for thermal conduction (2001), Chung, DDL, Applied Thermal Engineering, 21, 1593-1605; http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/eng/mae/cmrl/Materials%20for%20thermal%20conduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Further information about the thermal conductivity of selected metals is available.&lt;ref&gt;Thermal conductivity of selected metals; National Standard Reference Data System (NSRDS), US Department of Commerce, November 25, 1966; https://nist.gov/srd/nsrds/NSRDS-NBS-8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrosion resistance===
Corrosion resistance is essential in heat transfer applications where fluids are involved, such as in hot water tanks, radiators, etc. The only affordable material that has similar corrosion resistance to copper is stainless steel. However, the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 1/30th that of copper. Aluminium tubes are not suitable for potable or untreated water applications because it corrodes at pH&lt;7.0 and releases hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="brazetek.com"&gt;Finned coil heat exchangers (water to air heat exchangers); Brazetek; http://www.brazetek.com/water-to-air-heat-exchangers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Larson, Corrosion by domestic waters; ISWS-75 Bulletin 59; State of Illinois Department of Registration and Education; Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Fultonberg; Corrosion of aluminum in water; Westinghouse Electric Corp. Contract NAS 3-5215, prepared for the Lewis Research Center, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protective films can be applied to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to increase corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.&lt;ref name="shinkometal.co.jp"&gt;Kobelco: Copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger; Shinko Metal Products, Japan; http://www.shinkometal.co.jp/catalog/copperalloy-en-sc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofouling resistance===
Copper and copper-nickel alloys have a high natural resistance to biofouling relative to alternative materials. Other metals used in heat exchangers, such as steel, titanium and aluminium, foul readily. Protection against biofouling, particularly in marine structures, can be accomplished over long periods of time with copper metals.

Copper-nickel alloys have been proven over many years in sea water pipework and other marine applications. These alloys resist biofouling in open seas where they do not allow microbial slime to build up and support macrofouling.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, C.A.; Preventing biofouling with copper-nickel; Copper Development Association, October 2002; {{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030065725/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper-nickel/downloads/pub-157-preventing-biofouling-with-copper-nickel.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers attribute copper’s resistance to biofouling, even in temperate waters, to two possible mechanisms: 1) a retarding sequence of colonization through slow release of copper ions during the corrosion process, thereby inhibiting the attachment of microbial layers to marine surfaces;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, I.W., 1983, Microbial exopolysaccarides: Their role in microbial adhesion in aqueous systems, Critical Reviews in Microbiology, Vol. 10, pp.173–201&lt;/ref&gt; and/or, 2) separating layers that contain corrosive products and the larvae of macro-encrusting organisms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Edding, Mario E., Flores, Hector, and Miranda, Claudio, (1995), Experimental Usage of Copper-Nickel Alloy Mesh in Mariculture. Part 1: Feasibility of usage in a temperate zone; Part 2: Demonstration of usage in a cold zone; Final report to the International Copper Association Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter mechanism deters the settlement of pelagic larval stages on the metal surface, rather than killing the organisms.

===Antimicrobial properties===
Due to copper’s strong antimicrobial properties, copper fins can inhibit bacterial, fungal and viral growths that commonly build up in air conditioning systems. Hence, the surfaces of copper-based heat exchangers are cleaner for longer periods of time than heat exchangers made from other metals. This benefit offers a greatly expanded heat exchanger service life and contributes to improved air quality.
Heat exchangers fabricated separately from antimicrobial copper and aluminium in a full-scale HVAC system have been evaluated for their ability to limit microbial growth under conditions of normal flow rates using single-pass outside air. Commonly used aluminium components developed stable biofilms of bacteria and fungi within four weeks of operation. During the same time period, antimicrobial copper was able to limit bacterial loads associated with the copper heat exchanger fins by 99.99% and fungal loads by 99.74%.&lt;ref&gt;Michels, H. (2011).

Detrick, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00284-012-0137-0 |pmid=22569892 |pmc=3378845 |title=Characterization and Control of the Microbial Community Affiliated with Copper or Aluminum Heat Exchangers of HVAC Systems |journal=Current Microbiology |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=141–9 |year=2012 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Michael G. |last2=Attaway |first2=Hubert H. |last3=Terzieva |first3=Silva |last4=Marshall |first4=Anna |last5=Steed |first5=Lisa L. |last6=Salzberg |first6=Deborah |last7=Hamoodi |first7=Hameed A. |last8=Khan |first8=Jamil A. |last9=Feigley |first9=Charles E. |last10=Michels |first10=Harold.

Copper fin air conditioners have been deployed on buses in Shanghai to rapidly and completely kill bacteria, viruses and fungi that were previously thriving on non-copper fins and permitted to circulate around the systems. The decision to replace aluminium with copper followed antimicrobial tests by the [[Shanghai]] Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SCDC) from 2010 to 2012. The study found that microbial levels on copper fin surfaces were significantly lower than on aluminium, thereby helping to protect the health of bus passengers.&lt;ref name="microgroove.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jiangping, C.

=== Ease of inner grooving ===

[[Internally grooved copper tube]] of smaller diameters is more thermally efficient, materially efficient, and easier to bend and flare and otherwise work with.  It is generally easier to make inner grooved tubes out of copper, a very soft metal.

==Common applications for copper heat exchangers==

===Industrial facilities and power plants===
Copper alloys are extensively used as heat exchanger tubing in fossil and nuclear steam generating [[electric power plant]]s, chemical and [[petrochemical]] plants, marine services, and [[desalination]] plants.

The largest use of copper alloy heat exchanger tubing on a per unit basis is in utility power plants. These plants contain surface condensers, heaters, and coolers, all of which contain copper tubing. The main surface condenser that accepts turbine-steam discharges uses the most amount of copper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Cupronickel|Copper nickel]] is the group of alloys that are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in evaporators of desalination plants, process industry plants, air cooling zones of thermal power plants, high-pressure feed water heaters, and sea water piping in ships.&lt;ref name="shinkometal.co.jp"/&gt; The composition of the alloys can vary from 90% Cu–10% Ni to 70% Cu–30% Ni.

Condenser and heat exchanger tubing of arsenical admiralty brass (Cu-Zn-Sn-As) once dominated the industrial facility market. Aluminium brass later rose in popularity because of its enhanced corrosion resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Condenser and heat exchanger systems; CDA; W. Kirk, LaQue Center for Corrosion Technology ; Authur Tuthill, Consultant to Nickel Development Institute; http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_condenser_heat_exch_syst.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127215108/http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_condenser_heat_exch_syst.html# |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, aluminium-brass, 90%Cu-10%Ni, and other copper alloys are widely used in tubular heat exchangers and piping systems in [[seawater]], [[brackish water]] and [[fresh water]]. Aluminium-brass, 90% Cu-10% Ni  and 70% Cu-30% Ni alloys show good corrosion resistance in hot de-aerated seawater and in [[brine]]s in multi-stage flash desalination plants.&lt;ref&gt;B. Todd (1986). Nickel-Containing Materials in Marine and Related Environments. 25th Conference of Metallurgists, Toronto, August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copper.org"&gt;Heat Exchangers and Piping Systems from Copper Alloys - Commissioning, Operating and Shutdown, Manfred Jasner, Meinhard Hecht, Wolfgang Beckmann, KME; http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_kme.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020090304/http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_KME.html# |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed tube liquid-cooled heat exchangers especially suitable for marine and harsh applications can be assembled with brass shells, copper tubes, brass baffles, and forged brass integral end hubs.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Shell-and-tube heat exchangers; American Industrial Heat Transfer Inc.; http://www.aihti.com/pdf/fbf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper alloy tubes can be supplied either with a bright metallic surface (CuNiO) or with a thin, firmly attached oxide layer (aluminium brass). These finish types allow for the formation of a protective layer.&lt;ref name="copper.org"/&gt; The protective oxide surface is best achieved when the system is operated for several weeks with clean, oxygen containing cooling water. While the protective layer forms, supportive measures can be carried out to enhance the process, such as the addition of iron sulfate or intermittent tube cleaning. The protective film that forms on Cu-Ni alloys in aerated seawater becomes mature in about three months at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and becomes increasingly protective with time. The film is resistant to polluted waters, irregular velocities, and other harsh conditions. Further details are available.&lt;ref&gt;Heat Exchangers and Piping Systems from Copper Alloys - Commissioning, Operating and Shutdown; http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_kme.html#1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020090304/http://www.copper.org/applications/cuni/txt_KME.html#1#1 |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biofouling resistance of Cu-Ni alloys enables heat exchange units to operate for several months between mechanical cleanings. Cleanings are nevertheless needed to restore original heat transfer capabilities. [[Chlorine]] injection can extend the mechanical cleaning intervals to a year or more without detrimental effects on the Cu-Ni alloys.

===Solar thermal water systems===
[[Solar water heater]]s can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for homes in many regions of the world. Copper heat exchangers are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper’s high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and in primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks) of solar thermal water systems.&lt;ref&gt;2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)); {{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid%3D5434 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103024143/http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid=5434 |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of solar collectors for residential applications are available with either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems.&lt;ref&gt;Solar water heaters; Energy Savers; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy; http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850/&lt;/ref&gt; In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains a small amount of thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.

Other components in solar thermal water systems that contain copper include solar heat exchanger tanks and solar pumping stations, along with pumps and controllers.&lt;ref&gt;Solar hot water; B&amp;R Service Inc.; http://www.bandrservice.com/solar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How solar hot water system works; SolarPlusGreen.com; http://www.solarplusgreen.com/solar-know-how.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904220147/http://www.solarplusgreen.com/solar-know-how.htm# |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirasol Solar Energy Systems; http://www.mirasolenergysystems.com/pdf/et-technology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How solar heaters work; Mayca Solar Energy; {{cite web |url=http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028203532/http://www.maycasolar.com/techinfo.asp |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayat Energy: solar water heaters; http://www.bayatenergy.co.uk/Solar%20Water%20Heaters%20Catalogue.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103191342/http://www.bayatenergy.co.uk/Solar%20Water%20Heaters%20Catalogue.pdf# |date=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HVAC systems===
[[Air conditioning]] and [[heating]] in [[buildings]] and [[motor vehicles]] are two of the largest applications for [[heat exchangers]]. While copper tube is used in most air conditioning and refrigeration systems, typical air conditioning units currently use aluminium fins. These systems can harbor bacteria and mold and develop odors and fouling that can make them function poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Antimicrobial Copper; http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com&lt;/ref&gt; Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern [[HVAC]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Applications: Air Conditioning and Refrigeration; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/apps/acr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper’s antimicrobial properties can enhance the performance of HVAC systems and associated [[indoor air quality]]. After extensive testing, copper became a registered material in the U.S. for protecting heating and air conditioning equipment surfaces against [[bacteria]], [[mold]], and [[mildew]]. Furthermore, testing funded by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] is demonstrating that all-copper air conditioners suppress the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew that cause odors and reduce system energy efficiency. Units made with aluminium have not been demonstrating this benefit.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA registers antimicrobial copper for HVAC applications; Antimicrobial Copper; http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/us/news-center/news/us-epa-registers-antimicrobial-copper-for-hvac-applications.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buildings.com; Copper for HVAC Efficiency; http://www.buildings.com/tabid/3334/ArticleID/11545/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper can cause a galvanic reaction in the presence of other alloys, leading to corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewater.com/handbook/cooling_water_systems/ch_24_corrosion.jsp Corrosion Control-Cooling Systems | GE Water&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas water heaters===
Water heating is the second largest energy use in the home. Gas-water heat exchangers that transfer heat from gaseous fuels to water between 3 and 300 kilowatts thermal (kWth) have widespread residential and commercial use in water heating and heating boiler appliance applications.

Demand is increasing for energy-efficient compact water heating systems. Tankless gas water heaters produce hot water when needed. Copper heat exchangers are the preferred material in these units because of their high thermal conductivity and ease of fabrication. To protect these units in [[acid]]ic environments, durable coatings or other surface treatments are available. Acid-resistant coatings are capable of withstanding temperatures of 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Gas water heaters with improved heat exchangers; http://copperalliance.org/core-initiatives/technology/technology-projects/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gas Combustion Equipment; http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/technology_roadmap-en.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced air heating and cooling===
Air-source heat pumps have been used for residential and commercial heating and cooling for many years. These units rely on air-to-air heat exchange through evaporator units similar to those used for air conditioners. Finned water to air heat exchangers are most commonly used for forced air heating and cooling systems, such as with indoor and outdoor wood furnaces, boilers, and stoves. They can also be suitable for liquid cooling applications. Copper is specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.&lt;ref name="brazetek.com"/&gt;

===Direct Exchange (DX) Geothermal Heating/Cooling===
[[Geothermal]] heat pump technology, variously known as "ground source," "earth-coupled," or "direct exchange," relies on circulating a refrigerant through buried copper tubing for heat exchange. These units, which are considerably more efficient than their air-source counterparts, rely on the constancy of ground temperatures below the [[frost]] zone for heat transfer.
The most efficient ground source heat pumps use ACR, Type L or special-size copper tubing buried into the ground to transfer heat to or from the conditioned space. Flexible copper tube (typically 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch) can be buried in deep vertical holes, horizontally in a relatively shallow grid pattern, in a vertical fence-like arrangement in medium-depth trenches, or as custom configurations. Further information is available.&lt;ref&gt;Copper DX geothermal heat pump; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/heatpump/dxhp_main.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic systems===
Copper and aluminium are used as [[heat sinks]] and [[heat pipes]] in [[electronics|electronic]] cooling applications. A [[heat sink]] is a passive component that cools [[semiconductor]] and [[optoelectronic]] devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by [[convection]], [[radiation]], and [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].

Aluminium is the most prominently used heat sink material because of its lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;Thermal Solutions Intl., Copper heatsinks; http://www.thermal-solutions.us/copper-heatsinks.html&lt;/ref&gt; Copper heat sinks are a necessity when higher levels of thermal conductivity are needed. An alternative to all-copper or all-aluminium heat sinks is the joining of aluminium fins to a copper base.&lt;ref&gt;Cooliance; Copper heat sinks; {{cite web |url=http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011082149/http://www.cooliance.com/resources/copper-heatsinks.html |archivedate=2014-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper heat sinks are die-cast and bound together in plates. They spread heat quickly from the heat source to copper or aluminium fins and into the surrounding air.

Heat pipes are used to move heat away from [[central processing units]] (CPUs) and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) and towards heat sinks, where thermal energy is dissipated into the environment. Copper and aluminium heat pipes are used extensively in modern computer systems where increased power requirements and associated heat emissions result in greater demands on cooling systems.

A heat pipe typically consists of a sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize [[evaporative cooling]] to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the equivalent solid conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Electronics Cooling Methods in Industry; Heat Pipes in Electronics;  http://www.pathways.cu.edu.eg/ec/Text-PDF/Part%20C-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is desirable to maintain junction temperatures below 125-150&amp;nbsp;°C, copper/water heat pipes are typically used. Copper/[[methanol]] heat pipes are used if the application requires heat pipe operations below 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Electronics cooling: Heat pipes for electronics cooling applications; Sept. 1, 1996; http://www.electronics-cooling.com/1996/09/heat-pipes-for-electronics-cooling-applications&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main| CuproBraze}}
[[CuproBraze]] is a copper-alloy heat exchanger technology developed for applications that need to withstand harsh conditions. The technology is particularly amenable for higher temperature and pressure environments required in cleaner [[diesel engines]] that  are  being mandated by global [[environmental regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;Vehicle radiators: Can CuproBraze turn copper into a bona fide contender?; American Metal Market September 2008; http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46572847/Perspectives-radiators.pdf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viewer.zmags.com"&gt;Partanen, Juho (2011).

Applications for CuproBraze include [[charge air cooler]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[oil cooler]]s, climate control systems, and heat transfer cores.&lt;ref name="viewer.zmags.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuprobraze.com"&gt;Duensing, Lauren (2006) Develop efficient heat-transfer systems, Modern Metals, March 2006. http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/inthenews_moder-metals.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; CuproBraze is particularly suited for charge air coolers and radiators in [[capital intensive]] industries where [[machinery]] must operate for long periods of time under harsh conditions without premature failures. For these reasons, CuproBraze is particularly suited for the [[off-road vehicle]], [[truck]], [[bus]], industrial engine, [[Electric generator|generator]], [[locomotive]], and [[military equipment]] markets. The technology is also amenable for light trucks, [[SUV]]s and passenger [[car]]s.&lt;ref name="cuprobraze.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asia Hot on New Cooling Technology: Cooling Systems: New engine requirements mean manufacturers are changing to copper and brass for cooling systems; Automotive Engineering International, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CuproBraze®: Advanced heat-exchanger technology http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/CuproBrazeBrochure.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CuproBraze is an alternative to soldered copper/brass plate fin, soldered copper brass serpentine fin, and brazed aluminium serpentine fin.&lt;ref name="viewer.zmags.com"/&gt; The technology enables brazed copper serpentine fins to be used in copper-brass heat exchanger designs. These are less expensive to manufacture than soldered serpentine fin designs. They are also stronger, lighter, more durable, and have tougher joints.&lt;ref name="viewer.zmags.com"/&gt;

=== internally grooved ===

The benefits of smaller-diameter [[internally grooved copper tube]] for heat transfer are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2008.04.008 |title=The investigation of groove geometry effect on heat transfer for internally grooved tubes |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=753–61 |year=2009 |last1=Bilen |first1=Kadir |last2=Cetin |first2=Murat |last3=Gul |first3=Hasan |last4=Balta |first4=Tuba }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.12.001 |title=Heat transfer and single-phase flow in internally grooved tubes |journal=International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer |volume=42 |pages=62–8 |year=2013 |last1=Aroonrat |first1=K. |last2=Jumpholkul |first2=C. |last3=Leelaprachakul |first3=R. |last4=Dalkilic |first4=A.S. |last5=Mahian |first5=O. |last6=Wongwises |first6=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Smaller diameter coils have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized coils and they can withstand higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Smaller diameter coils also have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter. MicroGroove uses a grooved inner surface of the tube to increase the surface to volume ratio and increase turbulence to mix the refrigerant and homogenize temperatures across the tube.&lt;ref&gt;FAQs: Thirty Questions with Answers about Economical, Eco-friendly Copper Tubes for Air Conditioner Applications; http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/overview-ica-questions-and-answers-qa30.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove Brochure: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/microgroove-brochure-game-changer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove™ Update Newsletter: Volume 1, Issue 2, August 2011: http://www.microgroove.net/sites/default/files/4315_microgroove_newsletter_august_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Cosmopolitan localism''' is a [[social innovation]] approach to [[community development]] that seeks to link [[Local community|local]] and [[Global community|global]] communities through resilient infrastructures that bring [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] closer together, building on [[Distributed Systems|distributed systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983824383|title=Designs for the pluriverse : radical interdependence, autonomy, and the making of worlds|last=1951-|first=Escobar, Arturo,|isbn=9780822370901|location=Durham|oclc=983824383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, [[reciprocal relationship]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} between the local and the global.

Italian social innovation scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new [[sense of place]]. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13860">The '''double diversion''' is two-part theory about environmental harm that was developed by [[William Freudenburg]] and colleagues beginning in the 1990s, and focusing on "disproportionality" and "distraction."  The concept of disproportionality involves the observation that, rather than being a reflection of overall levels of [[economic activity]], the majority of [[environmental destruction]] is actually due to a relatively small number of economic actors, which enjoy privileged access to [[natural resource]]s, “diverting” those resources for the private benefit of the few.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freudenburg's original work on this concept was carried out in conjunction with his colleague from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Peter Nowak.  The reference to the "double" diversion reflects the argument that this first diversion is made possible in large part by the second—the diversion of attention, or distraction, often ironically relying on the widespread but empirically inaccurate belief that environmental harm is economically beneficial to the population as a whole.

== Historical emphasis on individual factors ==
The double diversion differs from previous theories about responsibility for environmental harm, which tend to focus on overall or average levels of environmental harm.  The most notable example is [[Garret Hardin]]’s 1968 article ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', which focuses on the conflict between individual self-interest and what benefits the society as a whole.  Hardin illustrates this concept through an example of [[herder]]s sharing an open stretch of [[Arable land|farmland]], which results in each individual developing an incentive to increase his individual number of [[cow]]s.  Hardin argued that as a result, all of the individual herders ignore long-term benefits that result from environmental [[environmental protection|conservation]], resulting in “individual [[rationality]] leading to a collective tragedy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardin|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tendency to focus on overall impacts continued into the 1970s and 1980s with the development of the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation by [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]].  The formula states that human impact on the environmental equals the product of population, affluence, and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrlich|Holdren|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; without considering that all individuals do not have equal environmental impacts.  This is similarly true in the case of [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]]’s 1980 book ''Overshoot: the Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change'', in which Catton emphasizes the argument that all of us have lifestyles that are based upon a time when our [[carrying capacity]] exceeded human load.  He argues that because we have been unwilling to modify our lifestyles as carrying capacities have been exceeded, subsequent generations are destined to inherit a world of increasing conflict for finite resources &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Catton|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also integral to the individual-emphasis from the writing of this period is the notion of the conflict between economic protection and [[economic growth]].  The typical feeling of this period is articulated through O’Connor (1988, 1991), who sees [[capitalism]] as relying on prosperity for the legitimization of economic expansion.  What occurs as a result, according to O’Connor, is an ever-increasing exploitation of both the environment and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disproportionality and distraction ==
According to the double diversion hypothesis, the emphasis on overall or average levels of individual impacts, which many 20th century authors stressed, ultimately missed the importance of the disproportionate impacts that economic outliers can have on the environment.  According to [[Lisa Berry]], “For societies where a small fraction of the population consumes many more resources or produces much more [[pollution]] than other members, the I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT model fails to communicate the vast differences in resource consumption that exist within groups.” &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} traces this emphasis to the fact that most scientists are trained to focus on statistical means.  However, according to the double diversion hypothesis, rather than being discarded, the extreme cases need to be the focus of the debate.

When this privileged access is threatened, according to Freudenburg, organized producers use distraction, through privileged accounts” largely unchallenged stories and beliefs that divert attention away from their patterns of research use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These privileged accounts ultimately get repeated so often that they ultimately become “embedded” within our language and thought. If the opposition is still refuses to stay silent and challenges them on their inequitable effects on the environment they engage in a disappearing act, where they do not “respond” why their company has the right enjoy profits of a public good, but instead point to the benefits that the populace supposedly receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when laws and policies are created, organized interests can expect to receive tangible rewards from the political system, while the remainder of the citizenry can expect to receive mainly symbolic rewards in the form of rhetoric.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double diversion in practice==
The double diversion is a sufficiently new theory for it to not have been tested extensively, but several notable studies suggest that it deserves greater attention. Although no notable counter-examples have yet been provided, their existence is entirely possible.

==In agriculture==
A case study of disproportionality in [[agriculture]] is provided by [[Peter Nowak]] and colleagues, who researched the agricultural practices of several thousand farmers in [[Wisconsin]]. They discuss how the trend of subsistence farms developing into livestock ranches, where the reuse of manure is discouraged, has increased disproportionality of negative environmental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak ''et al.'' found that a small number of farmers using non-normative practices had a significantly greater responsibility for environmental damage.  This was true regarding the amount of [[fertilizer]] used, the degree of erosion from the production of croplands, and the amount of [[phosphorus]] that accumulated in watersheds.  The majority of the soil test results are in the high or excessively high range for phosphorus values, with a clear sub-set of outliers that have values up to 900% above the sample mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because environmental regulations were crafted for the “average” rather than the exceptional farms, the policies did little to curb the runoff from the few farms that created significantly more than “their share” of the phosphorus problem. Nowak et al. concludes that “we are suggesting that indicators of environmental degradation in this situation […] failed to decrease during the 1976–1994 period because of the increasing important of disproportionate contributions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   	
Disproportionality in agriculture has also been observed in water use, with farmers and organized farm interests in dry western states of the U.S. commonly using 80&amp;nbsp;percent of those state’s water, while only having an economic relevance of 1–3&amp;nbsp;percent of the total economy.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disproportionate effect signifies that twenty thousand times as many jobs would be created if this same amount of water was used in industry.  Nevertheless, the top four percent of all farmers received 55&amp;nbsp;percent of all federal [[crop subsidies]], with this trend of this disproportionality increasing into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctance to challenge this status quo can be explained through diversion via the [[Social Multiplier Effect|social multiplier effect]]: even if a given individual does not work in a given industry, that person’s attitudes may be affected by whether his or her friends and relatives do.  Therefore, it makes sense that rural resident would be especially reluctant to criticize the industries or facilities they see as providing jobs for their friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In industry==
Disproportionate effects have also been observed within the [[industry|industrial]] setting in cases of both between and within-group comparisons. These inequalities can be measured using the [[Gini coefficient]], (which ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number signifying greater inequality.) {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} uses this coefficient to establish both between and in-group comparisons of industry toxicity, finding that chemical companies had a level 0.865 in comparison to other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in-group disproportionality between individual chemical companies was even more substantial, with the 62 chemical company facilities he analyzed producing a Gini coefficient of 0.975. These results are consistent with the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], which finds that expectations for proportionate relationships between economic activity and environmental harm can consistently be rejected at very high levels of significance.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"/&gt;

==Automobile pollution==
Disproportionality has also been observed by [[A. Kurniawan]] and [[A. Schmidt-Ott]], who developed a new sensing method in order to measure emissions of individual cars.  As in previous studies by [[Beaton (scientist)|Beaton]] ''et al.'' (1995) and [[Bishop &amp; Stedman]], (1996) they found that contrary to popular belief, a small group of “super polluters” is actually responsible for a disproportionate amount of total emissions.  In this particular study, Kurniawan ''et al.'' found that 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the total vehicles accounted for 43&amp;nbsp;percent of emissions.&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"&gt;{{harvp|Kurniawan|Schmidt-Ott|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these findings, they conclude that “properly maintained vehicles of any age are relatively small contributors to exhaust pollution and that most of the pollution is cause by a small percentage of badly maintained cars.”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt; Given these results, they suggest that unlike the current policies of most industrialized countries, the best solution is a targeted repair program that focuses on disproportionate polluters.  The benefits of such a policy is demonstrated through are demonstrated by Netherlands where it has been implemented, and the contribution of super-polluters has been greatly diminished.  Nonetheless, the failure of other countries to follow their lead has meant that “about half of the present particulate pollution by passenger cars would be avoidable if adequate monitoring would enable enforcement of existing laws”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt;

'''Ecosystem decay''' is a term coined by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] to define the process of which [[species]] become extinct locally based on [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warf|title=Encyclopedia of Geography|pages=856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is what led to the extinction of several species, including the Irish Elk. Ecosystem decay can be mainly attributed to population isolation, leading to [[inbreeding]], leading to a decrease in the population of local species. Another factor is the absence of competition, preventing the mechanisms of natural selection to benefit the population. This leads to a lack of a skill set for the animal to adjust and adapt to a new environment. 

Although similar to [[forest fragmentation]] and [[Island Biogeography Theory|island biogeography]], ecosystem decay is what results in the event of forest fragmentation.

Ecosystem decay is a natural phenomenon that has several resulting features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mokross|first=Karl|last2=Ryder|first2=Thomas B.|last3=Côrtes|first3=Marina Corrêa|last4=Wolfe|first4=Jared D.|last5=Stouffer|first5=Philip C.|date=2014-02-07|title=Decay of interspecific avian flock networks along a disturbance gradient in Amazonia|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1776/20132599|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1776|pages=20132599|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2599|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3871315|pmid=24335983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decline of native populations of animals
* Decrease in genetic diversity
* Decrease of the interior:[[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of an area of viable habitat
* Reduction in viable habitats and often extreme separation

==Process==
The process through which ecosystem decay occurs can be long and complicated or short and hasty. Overall, it still follows some basic guidelines. First, a piece of habitat is surrounded and thus isolated by farmland or cities.
Secondly, pollination of the plants immediately ceases and the number of species thins out. Thirdly, through generations of inbreeding and thus higher birth mortality than birth survival rate and infertile dirt, the forest fragment will slowly decline to nothing.

== Causes ==
Ecosystem decay is commonly caused by the harvesting of rain forest in appliance to certain laws or illegally for profit by humans. Certain countries such as [[Brazil]] prohibit the harvesting of [[Brazil nut|Brazil nut trees]] and groves of this species causing forest fragmentation and thus causing ecosystem decay to occur. Cities, roads, farms and any other substantial barrier impeding and animals habitat can be a direct or an indirect cause. Naturally, fires and rising sea levels on low land can also cause habitat fragmentation and thus ecosystem decay. Although this process is much more lengthy, many species such as the [[Irish Elk]] and several species of ancient [[Australian megafauna|Australian Marsupials]] have been indirectly killed this way with contributions by [[Climate Change]], [[Glaciation]] and [[Forest Fires]].

== Studies ==
Eleonore Setz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quammen|title=The Song Of The Dodo|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-684-80083-7|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; was studying a patch of equatorial rainforest named reserve #1202 containing ''[[white-faced saki|Pithecia pithecia]] (''white-faced sakis), to study the effects of ecosystem decay. The 9.2 hectare (less than 25 acre) area had been isolated for five years when [[David Quammen]] noted results on the fragmentation of their habitat which resulted in them being stranded. The population of ''P. Pithecia'' was slowly declining at the time of the study and the population had declined to six.

'''Energy in Macau''' is related to all of the type of [[energy]] and its related infrastructure used in [[Macau]], [[China]]. Energy-related affairs is administered under the [[Secretariat for Transport and Public Works (Macau)|Secretariat for Transport and Public Works]] of the [[Government of Macau]].

==Natural gas==
Macau import its [[natural gas]] supply from [[Hengqin Island]] in [[Zhuhai]], [[Guangdong]]. The pipeline has a capacity of 520 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas per year. The sole gas importer in Macau is '''Sinosky Energy (Holdings) Co. Ltd.''' ({{zh|t=中天能源控股有限公司}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaubusinessdaily.com/Economy/Insufficient-LNG-electricity-year |title=Insufficient LNG for electricity this year |publisher=Macau Business Daily |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226051359/http://macaubusinessdaily.com/Economy/Insufficient-LNG-electricity-year |archivedate=2013-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Extended Groth Strip'''&lt;ref name="24 Nov 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Pans Across Heavens to Harvest 50,000 Evolving Galaxies|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/06/image/a/|website=HubbleSite}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an image of a small region between the constellations of [[Ursa Major]] and [[Boötes]], based on the results of a series of observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It covers an area 70 [[arcminute]]s across and 10 arcminutes wide, which correlates to a patch of sky roughly the width of a finger stretched at arms length. The image was assembled from over 500 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] at 63 different pointings, spread out over the course of one year from June 2004 to March 2005. The complete image at the highest resolution in JPEG format is nearly 250 megabytes.

The Extended Groth Strip is named for [[Princeton University]] physicist Edward Groth. The project is jointly led by [[Sandra Faber]], professor of physics and astronomy at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California at Santa Cruz]], and [[Marc Davis (astronomer)|Marc Davis]], professor of astronomy at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].

There are at least 50,000 galaxies in its view, giving new clues about the universe's youth, from its "preteen" years to young adulthood. The snowstorm of galaxies in the Hubble panorama does not appear evenly spread out. Some galaxies seem to be grouped together. Others are scattered through space. This uneven distribution of galaxies traces the concentration of [[dark matter]], an invisible web-like structure stretching throughout space. Galaxies form in areas rich in dark matter.

The Extended Groth Strip is being studied in depth as part of the [[AEGIS (astronomy)|All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey]].

The '''GEMIX''' is a report commissioned by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] Minister of Climate and Energy, [[Paul Magnette]]. The full title in French is ''Quel mix énergétique idéal pour la Belgique aux horizons 2020 et 2030?''. It was completed on 30 September 2009&lt;ref name=GEMIX&gt;Groupe Gemix, ''[http://economie.fgov.be/fr/binaries/rapport_gemix_2009_fr_tcm326-76356.pdf Quel mix énergétique idéal pour la Belgique aux horizons 2020 et 2030?]''&lt;/ref&gt; and published on 9 October 2009. The report received a lot of publicity, due mainly to its recommendations on [[nuclear power]].

It was written by Dominique Woitrin, Marie Pierre Fauconnier, Danielle Devogelaer, Jacques Percebois, Luigi De Paoli, Jacques De Ruyck and Wolfgang Eichhammer. [[Luc Dufresne]] was president of the workgroup.&lt;ref name=GEMIX/&gt;

A '''geographical cluster''' is a localised [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]], usually an excess of something given the [[spatial distribution|distribution]] or variation of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is considered as an [[incidence rate]] that is unusual in that there is more of some variable than might be expected. Examples would include: a local excess disease rate, a crime hot spot, areas of high unemployment, [[accident blackspot]]s, unusually high positive residuals from a model, high concentrations of flora or fauna, physical features or events like earthquake epicenters etc... {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

Identifying these extreme regions may be useful in that there could be implicit geographical associations with other variables that can be identified and would be of interest. Pattern detection via the identification of such geographical clusters is a very simple and generic form of geographical analysis that has many applications in many different contexts. The emphasis is on localized clustering or patterning because this may well contain the most useful information.  {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

A geographical cluster is different from a high concentration as it is generally second order, involving the factoring in of the distribution of something else. {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

==Geographical cluster detection==
Identifying geographical clusters can be an important stage in a geographical analysis. Mapping the locations of unusual concentrations may help identify causes of these. Some techniques include the Geographical Analysis Machine and Besag and Newell's cluster detection method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotheringham|first1=A. Stewart|last2=Zhan|first2=F.

'''Geomagnetic latitude''' is a parameter analogous to [[latitude|geographic latitude]], except that, instead of being defined relative to the [[geographic poles]], it is defined by the axis of the [[dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic dipole]], which can be accurately extracted from the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Model]].

The '''global atmospheric electrical circuit''' is the course of continuous movement of [[atmospheric electricity]] between the [[ionosphere]] and the [[earth's surface|Earth]]. Through [[solar radiation]], [[lightning|thunderstorms]], and the '''fair-weather condition''', the atmosphere is subject to a continual and substantial [[electrical current]].

Principally, [[thunderstorm]]s throughout the world carry ''negative'' charges to the earth, which is then discharged gradually through the air in fair weather.&lt;ref name="Feynman"/&gt;

This atmospheric circuit is central to the study of [[atmospheric physics]] and [[meteorology]]. It is used in the [[Weather forecasting|prediction of thunderstorms,]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.missioninstruments.com/pages/learning/elec_fields.html|title=Mission Instruments: Electric Fields|website=www.missioninstruments.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was central to the [[History of electromagnetic theory|understanding of electricity]]. In the past it has been suggested as a source of [[Free energy suppression conspiracy theory|available energy,]] or [[World Wireless System|communications platform]].

The global electrical circuit is also applied to the study [[Air ionization therapy|human health]] and [[air pollution]], due of the interaction of negative ions and [[aerosol]]s. The effect of [[global warming]], and temperature-sensitivity of the Earth's electrical circuit is unknown.&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tesla Broadcast Tower 1904.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe Power Plant]] attempted to use the earth's electrical circuit for telecommunications]]
In the 18th century, scientists began understanding the link between [[lightning]] and electricity. In addition to the iconic [[kite experiment]]s of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas-François Dalibard]], some early studies of electric charges in a "cloudless atmosphere" were done by [[John Canton]], [[Giovanni Battista Beccaria|Giambatista Beccaria]], and [[John Read (inventor)|John Read]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=A. J.|last2=Harrison|first2=R. G.|date=2007-10-01|title=Atmospheric electricity in different weather conditions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.97/abstract|journal=Weather|language=en|volume=62|issue=10|pages=277–283|doi=10.1002/wea.97|issn=1477-8696|bibcode=2007Wthr...62..277B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1752, [[Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier]] observed electrification in fair weather. Various others performed measurements throughout the late 18th century, often finding consistent diurnal variations. During the 19th century, several long series of observations were made. Measurements near cities were heavily influenced by smoke pollution. In the early 20th century, balloon ascents provided information about the [[electric field]] in the [[upper atmosphere]]. Important work was done by the research vessel [[Carnegie (ship)|Carnegie]], which produced standardised measurements around the world's oceans (where the air is relatively clean).

[[C. T. R. Wilson]] was the first to present a theory of a global circuit in 1920.

==Mechanism==

=== Lightning ===
{{main|Lightning}}
[[Lightning]] strikes the earth 40,000 times per day,&lt;ref name="Feynman"&gt;[http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_09.html Electricity in the Atmosphere - Feynman Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be thought to charge the earth like a battery. Thunderstorms generate an [[electrical potential difference]] between the earth's surface and the ionosphere, mainly by means of lightning. Because of this, the ionosphere is positively charged relative to the earth.
Consequently, there is always a small current transporting [[charged particle]]s between the ionosphere and the surface.

=== Fair weather condition===
This current is carried by a small number of [[ion]]s present in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (generated mainly by [[cosmic ray]]s in the upper atmosphere, and by [[radioactivity]] near the surface).
Different locations, and meteorological conditions on the earth can have different [[electrical conductivity]]. Fair weather condition describes the state of [[atmospheric electricity]] where air carries this electrical current between the earth and the [[ionosphere]].

== Measurement ==
The [[voltage]]s involved in the Earth's circuit are significant. At [[sea level]], the typical potential [[gradient]] in fair weather is 120&amp;nbsp;V/m. Nonetheless, since the [[Electric conductivity|conductivity]] of air is limited, the associated currents are also limited. A typical value is 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|A]] over the entire planet.
When it is not rainy or stormy, the amount of electricity within the atmosphere is typically between 1000 and 1800 amps. In fair weather conditions, there are about 3.5 microamps per square kilometer (9 microamps per square mile).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/TerryMathew.shtml|title=Electric Current through the Atmosphere - The Physics Factbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|website=hypertextbook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can produce a 200+ volt difference between the head and feet of a regular person.

Local turbulence, winds, and other fluctuations also cause small variations in the fair weather electric field, causing the fair-weather condition to be partially regional.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/essd15jun99_1|title=Soaking in atmospheric electricity {{!}} Science Mission Directorate|website=science.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnegie curve ===
The Earth's electrical current varies according to a daily pattern called the Carnegie curve, believed to be caused by the regular daily variations in atmospheric electrification associated with the earth's weather regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=R. Giles|date=2013-03-01|title=The Carnegie Curve|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-012-9210-2|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=209–232|doi=10.1007/s10712-012-9210-2|issn=0169-3298|bibcode=2013SGeo...34..209H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern also shows seasonal variation, linked to the earth's solstices and equinoxes. It was named after the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]].

The '''Hettangian''' is the earliest [[age (geology)|age]] and lowest [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Jurassic]] [[Geological time scale|period]] of the [[geologic timescale]]. It spans the time between 201.3 ± 0.2 [[annum|Ma]] and 199.3 ± 0.3 Ma (million years ago).&lt;ref name="benton, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Prehistoric Life|year=2012|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hettangian follows the [[Rhaetian]] (part of the [[Triassic]] period) and is followed by the [[Sinemurian]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed geologic timescale, see Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In European stratigraphy the Hettangian is a part of the time span in which the [[Lias Group|Lias]] was deposited. An example is the British [[Blue Lias]], which has an upper Rhaetian to Sinemurian age. Another example is the lower Lias from the [[Northern Limestone Alps]] where well-preserved but very rare ammonites, including [[Alsatites]], have been found.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Hettangian was introduced in the literature by Swiss palaeontologist, [[Eugène Renevier]], in 1864. The stage takes its name from [[Hettange-Grande]], a town in north-eastern [[France]], just south of the border with [[Luxembourg]] on the main road from [[Luxembourg City]] to [[Metz]].

The base of the Hettangian stage (which is also the base of the Lower Jurassic [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] and the entire Jurassic [[system (stratigraphy)|system]]) is defined as the place in the stratigraphic column where fossils of the [[ammonite]] [[genus]] ''[[Psiloceras]]'' first appear. A global reference profile (a [[GSSP]]) for the base was defined 2010 at the [[Kuhjoch]] in the [[Karwendel]] in western [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/index.html GSSP Table] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175854/http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/index.html |date=2012-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the Hettangian stage (the base of the Sinemurian) is at the first appearances of ammonite [[genus|genera]] ''[[Vermiceras]]'' and ''[[Metophioceras]]''.

===Biostratigraphy===
The Hettangian contains three ammonite [[biozone]]s in the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]]:
*zone of ''[[Schlotheimia|Schlotheimia angulata]]''
*zone of ''[[Alsatites|Alsatites liasicus]]''
*zone of ''[[Psiloceras|Psiloceras planorbis]]''

==Palaeontology==

===†Ammonites===
[[File:Alsatites proaries SAM 0425.JPG|thumb|''Alsatites proaries'']]

At the end of the Triassic period, the ammonites died out almost entirely. During the Hettangian, however, the "Neoammonites" developed relatively quickly, so that even in the middle Hettangian a large number of genera and species existed.

In [[physics]], the '''Kondo effect''' describes the scattering of conduction [[Conduction electrons|electrons]] in a metal due to magnetic impurities, resulting in a characteristic change in [[electrical resistivity]] with temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Alex C |last=Hewson |author2=[[Jun Kondo]]  |date=2009 |title=Kondo effect |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=4 |number=3 |page=7529 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.7529 |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kondo_effect |accessdate=2009-12-18|bibcode=2009SchpJ...4.7529H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect was first described by [[Jun Kondo]], who applied third-order [[perturbation theory]] to the problem to account for s-d electron scattering. Kondo's model predicted that the scattering rate of conduction electrons of the magnetic impurity should diverge as the temperature approaches 0 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1143/PTP.32.37|title=Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys|date=1964|last1=Kondo|first1=Jun|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–49|bibcode = 1964PThPh..32...37K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extended to a lattice of ''magnetic impurities'', the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of [[heavy fermion|''heavy fermions'']] and [[Kondo insulator|''Kondo insulators'']] in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements like [[cerium]], [[praseodymium]], and [[ytterbium]], and actinide elements like [[uranium]]. The Kondo effect has also been observed in [[quantum dot]] systems.

==Theory==
The temperature dependence of the resistivity including the Kondo effect is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\rho(T) = \rho_0 + aT^2 + c_m \ln\frac{\mu}{T} + bT^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the residual resistance, aT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shows the contribution from the Fermi liquid properties, and the term bT&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is from the lattice vibrations; a, b and c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are constants. Jun Kondo derived the third term of the logarithmic dependence.

==Background==
Kondo's model was derived using perturbation theory, but later methods used non-perturbative techniques to refine his result. These improvements produced a finite resistivity but retained the feature of a resistance minimum at a non-zero temperature. One defines the '''Kondo temperature''' as the energy scale limiting the validity of the Kondo results. The [[Anderson impurity model]] and accompanying [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Wilsonian]] [[renormalization]] theory were an important contribution to understanding the underlying physics of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.124.41|url=http://cos.cumt.edu.cn/jpkc/dxwl/zl/zl1/Physical%20Review%20Classics/condensed/061.pdf|title=Localized Magnetic States in Metals|date=1961|last1=Anderson|first1=P.|journal=Physical Review|volume=124|issue=1|pages=41–53|bibcode=1961PhRv..124...41A}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Schrieffer-Wolff transformation]], it was shown that Kondo model lies in the strong coupling regime of the Anderson impurity model. The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrieffer, J.R.|author2=Wolff, P.A. |title=Relation between the Anderson and Kondo Hamiltonians|journal=Physical Review|date=September 1966|volume=149|issue=2|pages=491–492|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.149.491|bibcode = 1966PhRv..149..491S }}&lt;/ref&gt; projects out the high energy charge excitations in Anderson impurity model, obtaining the Kondo model as an effective Hamiltonian.

[[Image:kscheme.jpg|thumb|320px|Schematic of the weakly coupled high temperature situation in which the magnetic moments of conduction electrons in the metal host pass by the impurity magnetic moment at speeds of v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fermi velocity, experiencing only a mild antiferromagnetic correlation in the vicinity of the impurity. In contrast, as the temperature tends to zero the impurity magnetic moment and one conduction electron moment bind very strongly to form an overall non-magnetic state.]]

The Kondo effect can be considered as an example of [[asymptotic freedom]], i.e. a situation where the coupling becomes non-perturbatively strong at low temperatures and low energies. In the Kondo problem, the coupling refers to the interaction between the localized magnetic impurities and the itinerant electrons.

Extended to a lattice of ''magnetic impurities'', the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of [[heavy fermion|''heavy fermions'']] and [[Kondo insulator|''Kondo insulators'']] in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements like [[cerium]], [[praseodymium]], and [[ytterbium]], and actinide elements like [[uranium]]. In [[heavy fermion]] materials, the nonperturbative growth of the interaction leads to quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass, i.e., the electrons are dramatically slowed by the interactions. In a number of instances they actually are [[superconductors]]. More recently, it is believed that a manifestation of the Kondo effect is necessary for understanding the unusual metallic delta-phase of [[plutonium]].

More recently the Kondo effect has been observed in [[quantum dot]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.281.5376.540|first=Sara M.|last=Cronenwett|date=1998 |title=A Tunable Kondo Effect in Quantum Dots|journal=Science|volume=281|number=5376|pages=540–544|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5376/540.abstract|arxiv = cond-mat/9804211 |bibcode = 1998Sci...281..540C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Revival of the Kondo|url=http://kouwenhovenlab.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/97-revival-of-the-kondo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such systems, a quantum dot with at least one unpaired electron behaves as a magnetic impurity, and when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band, the conduction electrons can scatter off the dot. This is completely analogous to the more traditional case of a magnetic impurity in a metal.

In 2012, Beri and Cooper proposed a topological Kondo effect could be found with [[Majorana fermion]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Béri|first=B.|last2=Cooper|first2=N. R.|year=1568|title=Topological Kondo Effect with Majorana Fermions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=109|issue=15|pages=156803|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.156803|pmid=23102351|arxiv=1206.2224|bibcode=2012PhRvL.109o6803B}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it has been shown that [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulations]] with [[ultracold atom]]s may also demonstrate the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buccheri|first=F.|last2=Bruce|first2=G.

In 2017, teams from the Vienna University of Technology and Rice University conducted experiments into the development of new materials and theoretical work experimenting with structures made from the metals cerium, bismuth and palladium in specific combinations, respectively. The results of these experiments were published in December 2017, and contributed to theoretical work being undertaken by Dr. Hsin-Hua Lai and his team at Rice University, who realized the potential to create an entirely new material. They "stumbled upon" a model, and found that "the mass had gone from like 1,000 times the mass of an electron to zero".&lt;ref&gt;Gabbatiss, J. (2017) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/quantum-material-physics-weyl-kondo-semimetal-vienna-university-technology-a8121141.html "Scientists discover entirely new material that cannot be explained by classical physics"], ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; This is a characteristic of a [[Weyl semimetal]]. The team dubbed this new [[quantum material]] Weyl-Kondo [[semimetal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lai|first=H.H.|last2=Grefe|first2=S.E.|last3=Paschen|first3=S.|last4=Si|first4=Q.|year=1568|title=Weyl–Kondo semimetal in heavy-fermion systems|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1715851115.full|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=115|issue=1|pages=93-97|doi=10.1073/pnas.1715851115|pmid=29255021|pmc=5776817|arxiv=1206.2224|bibcode=2018PNAS..115...93L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10242">'''''Kourbania''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|το κουρμπάνι}}}} (sing.), {{lang|grc|τα κουρμπάνια}} (pl.); via [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Kurban''; from the [[Arabic]] ''[[Udhiyyah or Qurbani|qurban]]'' "sacrificial victim"; compare Hebrew ''[[korban]]'') refers to a practice of [[Christianized]] [[animal sacrifice]]s in some parts of [[Greece]]. It usually involves the slaughter of [[domestic sheep|lambs]] as "kourbania" offerings to certain [[Greek Orthodox saints|saint]]s. 

In antiquity the sacrifice was offered for health or following an accident or illness, as a [[Tama (votive)|votive offering]] promised to the Lord by the community, or by the relatives of the victim. Writing in 1979, Stella Georgoudi stated that the custom survived in "some villages of modern Greece" and was "slowly deteriorating and dying out". 

A similar custom from [[Bulgaria]] known as '''''Kurban'''''  is celebrated on [[Saint George|St. George]]'s day.

==Description==
The practice involves the blood sacrifice (θυσία, ''thusia'') of a domestic animal to either a saint, taken as the [[Patron saint|tutelary]] of the village in question, or dedicated to the [[Holy Trinity]] or the [[Theotokos|Virgin]]. The animal is slaughtered outside the village church, during or after the [[Divine Liturgy]], or on the eve of the feast day. The animal is sometimes led into the church before the icon of the saint, or even locked in the church during the night preceding the sacrifice. Most of the ''kourbania'' are spread between April and October. 

The descriptions (for both the Byzantine and Turkish periods) of this θυσία, or ''kurban'' (in Turkish), are numerous indeed, and are an example of one popular element which the Turks adopted from Byzantium. The most detailed description is given by the sixteenth-century Turkish slave Bartholomaeus Gourgieuiz:

{{quote|"The Manner of their (the Turks') sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;
In the time of anye disease or peril, they promise in certaine places to sacrifice either a Shepe or Oxe; after that the [[Votive offering|vowed offering]] is not burned, like unto a beast killed and layed on the [[Altar (Bible)|aulter]], as the custome was among the [[Judaism|Jewes]], but after that the beast is slaine, the skinne, head, feete, and fourthe parte of the flesh are gene unto the prest, an other part to [[Poverty|poore people]], and the thirde unto their neighbours. The killers of the sacrifice doo make readye the other fragmentes for the [[Slavery|sleves]] and their compaynions to feede on. Neyther are they bound to performe the vow, if they have not bene delivered from the possessed disease or peril. For all things with them are done condytionallye I will geve if thou willte graunt. The lyke worshyppinge of God is observed among the Gretians, Armenians, and other realmes in Asia imitating yet y Christian religio."&lt;ref&gt;[[Speros Vryonis]], Jr. ''"The Byzantine Legacy and Ottoman Forms."'' '''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''', Vol. 23/24 (1969/1970), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

===In Cappadocia (Anatolia)===
In the late nineteenth century, Greek Christians of the village of Zele (Sylata) in [[Cappadocia]] sacrificed animals to [[Saint Charalambos]] especially in time of illness. Though the Greeks frequently referred to these sacrifices by the Turkish term ''Kurban'', the sacrificial practices went back to Byzantine and pagan times as is evident from several factors. They frequently referred to these sacrifices by the ancient Greek terms θυσία and θάλι. The question of Christian borrowing from the Muslim ''Kurban'' sacrifice is probably restricted to the [[Philology|philological]] aspect, for the pagan sacrifice seems to have remained very lively and widespread in Byzantine times.&lt;ref name=VRYONIS&gt;[[Speros Vryonis]]. ''The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh Through the Fifteenth Century.'' Volume 4 of Publications of the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. University of California Press, 1971. p. 490. {{ISBN|9780520015975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Heracleopolis (Anatolia)===
One of the most spectacular examples of its existence in [[Byzantine Anatolia]] was the sacrifice of the fawn to St. Athenogenes at Pedachthoe/[[Sulusaray|Heracleopolis]]  on July 17 ([[July 16 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 16]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/07/16/102033-hieromartyr-athenogenes-the-bishop-of-heracleopolis Hieromartyr Athenogenes the Bishop of Heracleopolis].'' OCA - Lives of the Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Great Synaxaristes {{gr icon}}: ''[http://synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/134/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ἅγιος Ἀθηνογένης ἐπίσκοπος Πηδαχθόης καὶ οἱ Δέκα Μαθητές του].'' 16 Ιουλίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; On that day the young animal and its mother passed before the altar of the monastery church of St. Athenogenes while the [[Gospels]] were being read. The fawn was sacrificed, cooked, and eaten by the congregation and thus the faithful celebrated the glory of the martyred saint. The pagan usage of animal sacrifice survived also in the Byzantine practice of slaughtering and roasting animals after the celebration of ecclesiastical festivals.&lt;ref name=VRYONIS/&gt;

===In Lesbos===
In the village of Mistegna on [[Lesbos]], the ''kourbania'' is to the [[Akindinoi]] saints&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/11/02/103151-martyr-acindynus-of-persia Martyr Acindynus of Persia].'' OCA - Lives of the Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Great Synaxaristes {{gr icon}}: ''[http://synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/1073/sxsaintinfo.aspx Οἱ Ἅγιοι Ἀκίνδυνος, Ἀφθόνιος, Πηγάσιος, Ἐλπιδοφόρος (ἢ Ἐλπιδηφόρος) καὶ Ἀνεμπόδιστος].'' 2 Νοεμβρίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; on one of the Sundays following [[Easter]]. Also on Lesbos, the [[bull sacrifice]] to [[Saint]] [[Charalampus]] is set on a Sunday in May, on Mount Taurus outside the village of Saint Paraskevi. 

===In Thrace===
In the village of Mega Monastiri in northeastern [[Thrace]], the community used to buy the most robust calves and raise them specifically for the ''kourbania''. These animals designated for sacrifice were never used for farm labour. In some instances, the animal was bathed and decorated with flowers or ribbons, its horns decorated with strips of gold foil and led to sacrifice through all the streets in a joyous procession. 

The village priest then performed a number of rites to complete the consecration of the victim before the killing, but unlike the practice in antiquity, the act of killing the animal is no special office and can be performed by anyone. The sacrifice is followed by a festival. The food for the festival is prepared under the supervision of the churchwarden, and is blessed by the priest before the meal begins. In Mega Monastiri, these meals were the scene of gatherings of lineages or clans, each with its own stone table in the churchyard, the place of honour on the eastern end of the table reserved for the clan eldest. 

The prayers said by the priest over the victim have a long tradition of attestation, dating from at least the 8th century, establishing the animal sacrifice as long-standing within Christian tradition, over at least a millennium. 

==Criticism==
The sixteenth canon of the {{dn|Synod of Carthage|date=January 2018}} asked the emperor to put an end to this practice; while the commentary of [[Theodore Balsamon|Balsamon]] indicates that it was widespread in the twelfth century, and it has survived to the present day. The liturgical sacrifice in the Armenian church, known as ''[[madagh]],'' is also a survival from antiquity.&lt;ref name=VRYONIS/&gt;

In the late 18th century, a monk Nicodemus denounced the ''kourbania'' as a "barbaric custom" and "vestige of ancient pagan error", without success, as he was himself accused of heresy by the village priests. 

Also in the 18th century, bishop Theophiles of Campania attacked the custom as an imitation of the "vain Hellenes". Greek ethnographers in the 19th century did not hesitate to identify the ''kourbani'' as a survival of pre-Christian Greek antiquity.  

Georgoudi (1979) prefers a comparison with the Hebrew sacrifices [[korban]] of the [[Old Testament]], citing early medieval canons and conciliaries which denounce customs such as cooking meat in the sanctuary as Jewish and Armenian Christian, not Greek, practice.

Since the reliable [[HURDAT|record keeping]] of [[tropical cyclone]] data within the [[Atlantic hurricane|North Atlantic Ocean]] began in [[1851 Atlantic hurricane season|1851]],{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} there have been 1,574&amp;nbsp;&lt;!-- updated 02:23 UTC 22 October 2018 --&gt;systems of at least [[tropical storm]] intensity and 912&amp;nbsp;&lt;!-- updated 02:23 UTC 22 October 2018 --&gt;of at least [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|hurricane intensity]]. Though a majority of these tropical depressions  have fallen within climatological averages, prevailing atmospheric conditions occasionally lead to anomalous tropical systems which at times reach extremes in statistical record-keeping including in duration and intensity.&lt;ref name=Climatology&gt;{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=14 August 2013|author=National Hurricane Center|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of this list is limited to tropical cyclone records solely within the Atlantic Ocean and is subdivided by their reason for notability.

*Note: Storms that originally form as a tropical depression will not be posted unless they reach tropical storm status (for example, Hurricane Michael in 2012 formed on September 3 as a tropical depression, but was not named until it reached tropical storm status, on September 4, thus putting Hurricane Michael on the list with the date September 4).

==Intensity==
===Most intense===
====By pressure====
{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}
Generally speaking, the intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either the storm's [[maximum sustained wind]]s or lowest [[barometric pressure]]. The following table lists the most intense Atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure. In terms of wind speed, [[Hurricane Allen|Allen]] from [[1980 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Allen|1980]] was the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, with maximum sustained winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. For many years, it was thought that [[Hurricane Camille]] also attained this intensity, but this conclusion was changed in 2014. The original measurements of Camille are suspect since wind speed instrumentation used at the time would likely be damaged by winds of such intensity.&lt;ref name=MostIntense&gt;{{cite book|author=Landsea, Chris|chapter=E1) Which is the most intense tropical cyclone on record?|type=FAQ|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/weather_sub/faq.html|chapterurl=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|accessdate=22 September 2013|version=4.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, their central pressures are low enough to rank them among the strongest recorded Atlantic hurricanes.&lt;ref name=HURDAT /&gt;

Owing to their intensity, the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all attained Category&amp;nbsp;5 classification. [[Hurricane Opal]], the strongest Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane recorded, intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 916&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.05&amp;nbsp;inHg),&lt;ref name=OpalTCR&gt;{{cite report|author=Mayfield, Max |publisher=National Hurricane Center |date=November 29, 1995 |accessdate=22 September 2013 |title=Hurricane Opal Preliminary Report |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995opal.html |type=Preliminary Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503071400/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995opal.html |archivedate= 3 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pressure typical of Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes.&lt;ref name=SSHS-LSU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|url=http://lagic.lsu.edu/hurricanes/saffir-simpson.htm|publisher=Louisiana State University|accessdate=23 September 2013|author=Louisiana Geographic Information Center|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal as one of the ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name=HURDAT /&gt; Presently, [[Hurricane Wilma]] is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.05&amp;nbsp;inHg) in October&amp;nbsp;2005;&lt;ref name=MostIntense /&gt; this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the [[Pacific typhoon|West Pacific]],{{EPAC hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=NIO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/bestpara.xls |title=Tropical Cyclone Best Track Information for the North Indian Ocean 1990-2008 |year=2009 |publisher=[[India Meteorological Department]] |accessdate=22 September 2013 |format=XLS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116093857/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/bestpara.xls |archivedate=16 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gafilo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/TGPR/saison20032004B/07_table.html|title=Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Gafilo|author=Royer, Stephane|date=7 February 2003|publisher=[[Météo France]]|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BOM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/silo/cyclones.cgi|title=Tropical Cyclone Information for the Australian Region|year=2008|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{TCWC Wellington BT}} where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures.&lt;ref name=WPACBT&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/besttrack.html|title=Western North Pacific Typhoon best track file 1951-{{#time:Y}}|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later superseded by [[Hurricane Patricia]] in [[2015 Pacific hurricane season|2015]] in the east Pacific, which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar.

[[Hurricane Rita]] is the fourth strongest Atlantic hurricane in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] at first and seventh, respectively.&lt;ref name=HURDAT /&gt; However, with a barometric pressure of 895&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.43&amp;nbsp;inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=RitaReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Post Storm Data Acquisition&amp;nbsp;– Hurricane Rita Peak Gust Analysis and Storm Surge Data|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/data/pdfs/Rita.pdf|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=23 September 2013|author=National Weather Service|format=PDF|date=November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Most intense landfalling Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}} In between Rita and Katrina is [[Hurricane Allen]]. Allen's pressure was measured at 899&amp;nbsp;mbar. Hurricane Camille is the sixth strongest hurricane on record. Camille is the only storm to have been moved down the list due to post-storm analysis. Camille was originally recognized as the fifth strongest hurricane on record, but was dropped to the seventh strongest in 2014, with an estimated pressure at 905&amp;nbsp;mbars, tying it with Hurricanes [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]], and [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]]. Camille then was recategorized with a new pressure of 900&amp;nbsp;mbars. Currently, Mitch and Dean share intensities for the eighth strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.73&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref name=DeanTCR /&gt; [[Hurricane Maria]] is in tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone, with a pressure as low as 908&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.81&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Daniel|title=Hurricane Maria Intermediate Advisory Number 15A|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT5+shtml/192357.shtml|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the most intense Atlantic hurricane outside of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] is [[Hurricane Irma]] of [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|2017]], with a pressure of 914&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.0&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alessandra Potenza|title=Irma is now one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/5/16254858/hurricane-irma-category-5-forecasts|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] or demise. However, six of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some of the strongest landfalling hurricanes&amp;nbsp;– six of the ten hurricanes on the list constitute six of the most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935&amp;nbsp;Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, the most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall.&lt;!-- The Labor Day hurricane is tied with 2017's Irma as the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall by windspeed, but not in terms of pressure.

===Seasonal activity===
From 1981 to 2010, there were on average 12.1 storms in the Atlantic Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml|title=Background Information: The North Atlantic Hurricane Season|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=Climate Prediction Center|date=August 9, 2012|accessdate=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each hurricane season may be impacted by an [[El Niño]] or [[La Niña]] which contributes to the amount of storms in any given year, and a hurricane with a peak intensity of Category&amp;nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] is classified as major. Most Atlantic hurricane seasons between 1851, and 1930 included 7 or fewer recorded tropical storms or hurricanes, as well as many seasons between 1930 and 1965. The usage of satellite data was not available until the mid-1960s, which makes early storm counts less reliable. 

The most active [[Atlantic hurricane season]] in [[recorded history]] took place in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], when a total of 28 storms were counted. The storm count includes 15 hurricanes, of which 7 strengthened to major hurricane status.

This is a '''list of the brightest [[star]]s''' down to [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] +2.50, as determined by their ''maximum'', ''total'', or ''combined'' [[apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]]s as viewed from [[Earth]]. Although several of the brightest stars are also known close [[binary system|binary]] or [[star cluster|multiple]] [[star system]]s, they appear to the naked eye as single stars. The given list below combines/adds the magnitudes of bright individual components. Most of the proper names in this list are those approved by the [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]].&lt;ref name="List of IAU-approved Star Names"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/#table
|title=Naming Stars
|publisher=IAU Division C WG Star Names
|accessdate=12 August 2018
}} &lt;/ref&gt; Popular star names here that have not been approved by the IAU appear with a short note.

==Measurement==
Apparent visual magnitudes of the brightest star can also be compared to non-stellar objects in our [[Solar System]]. Here the maximum visible magnitudes above the brightest star, Sirius (&amp;minus;1.46), are as follows. Excluding the Sun, the brightest objects are the [[Moon]] (&amp;minus;12.7), [[Venus]] (&amp;minus;4.89), [[Jupiter]] (&amp;minus;2.94), [[Mars]] (&amp;minus;2.91), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (&amp;minus;2.45), and [[Saturn]] (&amp;minus;0.49).

Any exact order of the visual brightness of stars is not perfectly defined for four reasons:

* Stellar brightness is traditionally based on the [[apparent magnitude|apparent visual magnitude]] as perceived by the human eye, from the brightest stars of 1st magnitude to the faintest at 6th magnitude. Since the optical telescope's invention, and the known existence of double or binary stars, has meant that stellar brightness could be expressed as either ''individual'' (separate) or ''total'' (combined) magnitude. The table is ordered by combined magnitude of all naked eye components appearing as if it they were single stars. Such stars are included in parentheses, where any individual component magnitudes are bright enough to make a detectable contribution. e.g. the double star [[Alpha Centauri]] has the total or combined magnitude of &amp;minus;0.27, while its two component stars have magnitudes of +0.01 and +1.33.&lt;ref name=hr&gt;{{cite journal

|bibcode=1991bsc..book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New or more accurate [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], standard filters, or adopting differing methods using standard stars can measure stellar magnitudes slightly differently. This may change the apparent order of lists of bright stars. The table shows measured V magnitudes, which use a [[UBV photometric system|specific filter]] that closely approximates human vision. However, other kinds of magnitude systems do exist based on different wavelengths, some well away from the distribution of the visible wavelengths of light, and these apparent magnitudes vary dramatically in the different systems.&lt;ref name=bessell&gt;{{cite journal

* Some stars, like [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Antares]], are [[variable star]]s, changing their magnitude over days, months or years. In the table, the range of variation is indicated with &lt;small&gt;var&lt;/small&gt;. Single magnitude values quoted for variable stars come from a variety of sources. Magnitudes are expressed within the table are when the stars are either at maximum brightness, which is repeated for every cycle, e.g., the eclipsing binary Algol; or, if the variations are small, as a simple average magnitude. For all red variable stars, describing a single maximum brightness is often difficult because each cycle produces a different maximum brightness, which is thought to be caused by poorly understood pulsations in [[stellar evolution]] processes. Such quoted stellar brightness is sometimes based on the ''average maximum apparent magnitude'' &lt;ref name="MDofA"&gt;{{cite web

Results often quoted in the literature are not necessarily straightforward and may differ in expressing an alternate value for a singular maximum brightness or as a range of values.
* A select number of stars, thought to be uniformly fixed in brightness, are used as [[Photometric standard stars|standard stars]]. These standard stars have carefully determined magnitudes that have been analysed over many years, and are often used to determine other star's magnitudes or their stellar parameters using comparatively consistent scales.&lt;ref name=landolt&gt;{{cite journal

An '''environmental ministry''' is a national or subnational [[government agency]] politically responsible for the environment and/or natural resources. Various other names are commonly used to identify such agencies, such as '''Ministry of the Environment''', '''Department of the Environment''',  '''Department for the Environment''', '''Department of Environmental Protection''', '''Department of Natural Resources''', and so forth. Such agencies typically address environmental concerns such as the maintenance of [[environmental quality]], [[nature preserve]]s, the [[sustainability|sustained]] use of [[natural resources]], and prevention of [[pollution]] or [[contamination]] of the [[natural environment]]. Following is a list of environmental ministries by country:

'''[[Pakistan]]''' has 29 [[protected area]]s known as '''[[National Park|national parks]]''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''پاکستان کی ملی باغ'''}}}}). As of 2012, 22 of these are under supervision of respective [[Provincial Governments of Pakistan|provincial governments]] and remaining are in private care.&lt;ref name="review_PAS"/&gt; Only some of these are under the conservation scope of [[IUCN]]. Protection and conservation of the environment of Pakistan was included in the concurrent [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] of 1973. As a result, ''Environment Protection Ordinance'' was enacted in 1983, which was mainly regulated by the Environment and Urban Affairs Division. Later, a new system of 'Modern Protected Areas' legislation began at the provincial level which assigned the protected areas with designations such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves. Further recommendations of the national parks of the [[Indomalaya ecozone]] were highlighted in the [[IUCN]] review of 1986.&lt;ref name="iucn_pak_pas"/&gt; Nevertheless, the development of national parks was mainly carried out by [[Environmental issues in Pakistan#National Conservation Strategy|National Conservation Strategy]] of 1992. Due to more awareness about their importance in conservation of biodiversity, 10 national parks have been established during the time period from 1993 to 2005.&lt;ref name="review_PAS"/&gt;

According to the 'Modern Protected Areas' legislation, a national park is a protected area set aside by the [[Government of Pakistan|government]] for the protection and conservation of its outstanding scenery and wildlife in a natural state. It is accessible to public for research, education and recreation. In order to promote public use, construction of roads and rest houses is permitted. Use of firearms, polluting water, cleaning of land for cultivation, destruction of wildlife is banned in these areas.&lt;ref name="parc_gov_report"/&gt; The oldest national park is [[Lal Suhanra National Park|Lal Suhanra]] in [[Bahawalpur District]], established in 1972.&lt;ref name="cjpas_june_2010"/&gt; It is also the only [[biosphere reserve]] of Pakistan. Lal Suhanra is the only national park established before the [[History of Pakistan#Independence of Pakistan|independence]] of the nation in August 1947. The main purpose of this area was to protect the wildlife of [[Cholistan Desert]].&lt;ref name="parc_gov_report"/&gt; [[Central Karakoram National Park|Central Karakoram]] in [[Gilgit Baltistan]] is currently the largest national park in the country, spanning over a total approximate area of {{convert|1390100|ha|acre|1|sortable=on}}. The smallest national park is the [[Ayub National Park|Ayub]], covering a total approximate area of {{convert|931|ha|acre|1|sortable=on}}.

There seems to be little consensus in published sources as to the lengths of rivers, nor much agreement as to what constitutes a river. Thus the River Ure and [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] can be counted as one river system or as two rivers. If it is counted as one, the [[River Aire]]/ River Ouse/[[Humber]] system would come fourth in the list, with a combined length of {{convert|161|mi|km}}; and the [[River Trent]]/Humber system would top the list with their combined length of {{convert|222|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://copranet.projects.eucc-d.de/files/000165_EUROSION_Humber_Estuary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the [[Thames]] tributary, the [[River Churn]], sourced at Seven Springs, adds {{convert|14|mi|km}} to the length of the Thames (from its traditional source at Thames Head). The [[River Churn|Churn]]/Thames' length at {{convert|229|mi|km}} is therefore greater than the [[Severn]]'s length of {{convert|220|mi|km|0}}. Thus, the combined Churn/Thames river would top the list. Sue Owen et al., in their book on rivers, generally restrict the length to the parts that bear the same name. Thus the River Nene is quoted at {{convert|100|mi|km}}, but would be around {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} more if the variously named sources were included. Many of the above lengths are considerably different from Sue Owen's list, some longer and some shorter.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

Where a river ends in an estuary the conventional British approach has been to treat the river as ending at the end of the administrative zone. Thus the Severn ends at the mouth of the [[Bristol Avon]] and the Thames at the [[London Stone (riparian)#Crow Stone|Yantlet Line]]. The currently accepted end of the Severn Estuary is about {{convert|18.5|mi|km}} further, and the [[Port of London|PLA's]] authority stretches now to Margate, {{convert|30|mi|km}} further. Other countries have different conventions, making comparisons of limited value.

== History ==
=== Watches ===
The earliest attempts to reduce the amount of power required by an electronic device were related to the development of the [[wristwatch]]. Electronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the [[mainspring]], to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the [[Hamilton Electric 500]], was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].

[[Watch batteries]] (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In some cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.

The first digital ''electronic'' watch, a [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] LED prototype in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texascooppower.com/texas-stories/people/all-in-good-time|title=All in Good Time: HILCO EC director donates prototype of world's first working digital watch to Smithsonian|work=Texas Co-op Power|date=Feb 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital LED watches were very expensive and out of reach to the common consumer until 1975, when [[Texas Instruments]] started to mass-produce LED watches inside a plastic case.

Most watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds, because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness you had to press a button to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P. Wild, ''Illuminating Arrangement for a Field-Effect Liquid-Crystal Display as well as Fabrication and Application of the Illuminating Arrangement'', filed 15 October 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, processors specifically designed for wristwatches are the [[CPU power dissipation|lowest-power processors]] manufactured today—often [[4-bit]], 32&amp;nbsp;kHz processors.

=== Mobile computing ===
{{tense}}
When [[personal computers]] were first developed, power consumption was not an issue. Soon after though, development of [[portable computers]] started, and with it, the requirement to run a computer off a [[battery pack]], setting off the search for a compromise between [[computing power]] and power consumption. Originally most [[processors]] ran both the core and I/O circuits at 5 volts, as in the [[Intel 8088]] used by the first [[Compaq Portable]]. It was later reduced to 3.5, 3.3 and 2.5 volts to lower power consumption. For example, the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium P5]] core voltage decreased from 5V in 1993, to 2.5V in 1997.

With lower voltage comes lower overall power consumption. By consuming less power, the system will be less expensive to run, but more importantly for portable or mobile systems, it will run much longer on existing battery technology. The emphasis on battery operation has driven many of the advances in lowering processor voltage because this has a significant effect on battery life. The second major benefit is that with less voltage and therefore less power consumption, there will be less heat produced. Processors that run cooler can be packed into systems more tightly and will last longer. The third major benefit is that a processor running cooler on less power can be made to run faster. Lowering the voltage has been one of the key factors in allowing the [[clock rate]] of processors to go higher and higher.

===Computing elements===

The density and speed of integrated-circuit computing elements have increased exponentially for several decades, following a trend described by [[Moore's Law]]. While it is generally accepted that this exponential improvement trend will end, it is unclear exactly how dense and fast integrated circuits will get by the time this point is reached. Working devices have been demonstrated which were fabricated with a [[MOSFET]] [[transistor]] channel length of 6.3 [[nanometre]]s using conventional semiconductor materials, and devices have been built that used [[carbon nanotube]]s as MOSFET gates, giving a channel length of approximately one [[nanometre]]. The density and computing power of integrated circuits are limited primarily by power-dissipation concerns.

The overall [[power consumption]] of a new personal computer has been increasing at about 22% growth per year.
This increase in consumption comes even though the energy consumed by a single CMOS logic gate to change state has fallen exponentially with the Moore's law shrinking of process feature size.
&lt;ref&gt;

"The Incredible Shrinking CPU: Peril of Proliferating Power".

&lt;/ref&gt;

An integrated-circuit chip contains many [[capacitor|capacitive]] loads, formed both intentionally (as with gate-to-channel capacitance) and unintentionally (between conductors which are near each other but not electrically connected). Changing the state of the circuit causes a change in the voltage across these [[parasitic capacitance]]s, which involves a change in the amount of stored energy. As the capacitive loads are charged and discharged through [[resistor|resistive]] devices, an amount of energy comparable to that stored in the capacitor is dissipated as heat:

:&lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{stored} = {1 \over 2} C U^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The effect of heat dissipation on state change is to limit the amount of computation that may be performed within a given power budget. While device shrinkage can reduce some parasitic capacitances, the number of devices on an integrated-circuit chip has increased more than enough to compensate for reduced capacitance in each individual device. Some circuits – [[dynamic logic (digital logic)|dynamic logic]], for example – require a minimum clock rate in order to function properly, wasting "dynamic power" even when they do not perform useful computations. Other circuits – most prominently, the [[RCA 1802]], but also several later chips such as the [[WDC 65C02]], the [[Intel 80C85]], the [[Freescale 68HC11]] and some other [[CMOS]] chips – use "fully static logic" that has no minimum clock rate, but can "stop the clock" and hold their state indefinitely. When the clock is stopped, such circuits use no dynamic power but they still have a small, static power consumption caused by leakage current.

As circuit dimensions shrink, [[subthreshold leakage]] current becomes more prominent. This leakage current results in power consumption, even when no switching is taking place (static power consumption). In modern chips, this current generally accounts for half the power consumed by the IC.

===Reducing power loss===

Loss from [[subthreshold leakage]] can be reduced by raising the [[threshold voltage]] and lowering the supply voltage. Both these changes slowdown the circuit significantly. To address this issue, some modern low-power circuits use dual supply voltages to improve speed on critical paths of the circuit and lower power-consumption on non-critical paths.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/15478916/A_Survey_Of_Architectural_Techniques_for_Near-Threshold_Computing A Survey Of Architectural Techniques for Near-Threshold Computing]", S. Mittal, ACM JETC, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Some circuits even use different transistors (with different threshold voltages) in different parts of the circuit, in an attempt to further reduce power consumption without significant performance loss.

Another method used to reduce power consumption is [[power gating]]:&lt;ref&gt;
K. Roy, et. al.,
"Leakage current mechanisms and leakage reduction techniques in deep-submicrometer CMOS circuits", Proceedings of the IEEE,
2003.
[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1182065&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1182065/]
&lt;/ref&gt; the use of sleep transistors to disable entire blocks when not in use. Systems which are dormant for long periods of time and "wake up" to perform a periodic activity are often in an isolated location monitoring an activity. These systems are generally battery- or solar-powered and hence, reducing power consumption is a key design issue for these systems. By shutting down a functional but leaky block until it is used, leakage current can be reduced significantly. For some embedded systems that only function for short periods at a time, this can dramatically reduce power consumption.

Two other approaches also exist to lower the power overhead of state changes. One is to reduce the operating voltage of the circuit, as in a [[dual-voltage CPU]], or to reduce the voltage change involved in a state change (making a state change only, changing node voltage by a fraction of the supply voltage—[[low voltage differential signaling]], for example). This approach is limited by thermal noise within the circuit. There is a characteristic voltage (proportional to the device temperature and to the [[Boltzmann constant]]), which the state switching voltage must exceed in order for the circuit to be resistant to noise. This is typically on the order of 50–100 mV, for devices rated to 100 [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]] external temperature (about 4 ''kT'', where ''T'' is the device's internal temperature in [[kelvin]]s and ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]).

The second approach is to attempt to provide charge to the capacitive loads through paths that are not primarily resistive. This is the principle behind [[adiabatic circuit]]s. The charge is supplied either from a variable-voltage [[inductor|inductive]] power supply, or by other elements in a [[Toffoli gate|reversible-logic]] circuit. In both cases, the charge transfer must be primarily regulated by the non-resistive load. As a practical rule of thumb, this means the change rate of a signal must be slower than that dictated by the [[RC time constant]] of the circuit being driven. In other words, the price of reduced power consumption per unit computation is a reduced absolute speed of computation. In practice although adiabatic circuits have been built, they have been difficult to use to reduce computation power substantially in practical circuits.

Finally, there are several techniques for reducing the number of state changes associated with a given computation. For clocked- logic circuits, [[clock gating]] technique is used, to avoid changing the state of functional blocks that are not required for a given operation. As a more-extreme alternative, the [[asynchronous logic]] approach implements circuits in such a way that a specific externally supplied clock is not required. While both of these techniques are used to different extents in integrated circuit design, the limit of practical applicability for each appears to have been reached.

===Wireless communication elements===

There are a variety of techniques for reducing the amount of battery power required for a desired wireless communication [[goodput]].
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wirelessnetdesignline.com/howto/208400363 "How to use optional wireless power-save protocols to dramatically reduce power consumption"] by Bill McFarland 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[wireless mesh network]]s use [[Low-power broadcasting#Opinions|"smart" low power broadcasting]] techniques that reduce the battery power required to transmit.

This can be achieved by using [[List of ad hoc routing protocols#Power-aware routing protocols|power aware protocols]] and joint power control systems.

===Costs===
The weight and cost of power supply and cooling systems generally depends on the maximum possible power that could be used at some instant.
There are two ways to prevent a system from being permanently damaged by excessive heat.
Most desktop computers design power and cooling systems around the worst-case [[CPU power dissipation]] at the maximum frequency, maximum workload, and worst-case environment.
To reduce weight and cost, many laptop computers systems choose to use a much lighter, lower-cost cooling system designed around a much lower [[Thermal Design Power]], that is somewhat above expected maximum frequency, typical workload, and typical environment.
Typically such systems reduce (throttle) the clock rate when the CPU die temperature gets too hot, reducing the power dissipated to a level that the cooling system can handle.

These observations led a number of researchers to look for remnants of more ancient coastlines and further raised the possibility that such an ocean once existed.&lt;ref name='Astrobio Mag 2001'&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Mars Ocean Hypothesis Hits the Shore | date = 26 January 2001 | url = http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/58/mars-ocean-hypothesis-hits-the-shore | work = [[Astrobiology Magazine]] | accessdate = 19 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, {{ill|John E.

Beginning in 1998, scientists [[Michael Malin]] and Kenneth Edgett set out to investigate with higher-resolution cameras on board the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] with a resolution five to ten times better than those of the Viking spacecraft, in places that would test shorelines proposed by others in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name='Astrobio Mag 2001'/&gt; Their analyses were inconclusive at best, and reported that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers, rising and falling from one peak to the next for thousands of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Oceans or Seas in the Martian Northern Lowlands: High Resolution Imaging Tests of Proposed Coastlines | author=Malin, M.

In 2007, Taylor Perron and [[Michael Manga]] proposed a geophysical model that, after adjustment for [[true polar wander]] caused by mass redistributions from volcanism, the Martian paleo-shorelines first proposed in 1987 by John E.

Research published in 2009 shows a much higher density of stream channels than formerly believed. Regions on Mars with the most valleys are comparable to what is found on the Earth. In the research, the team developed a computer program to identify valleys by searching for U-shaped structures in topographical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Martian North Once Covered by Ocean | date = 26 November 2009 | url = http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3322/martian-north-once-covered-by-ocean | work = Astrobiology Magazine | accessdate = 19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large amount of valley networks strongly supports rain on the planet in the past. The global pattern of the Martian valleys could be explained with a big northern ocean. A large ocean in the northern hemisphere would explain why there is a southern limit to valley networks; the southernmost regions of Mars, farthest from the water reservoir, would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys. In a similar fashion the lack of rainfall would explain why Martian valleys become shallower from north to south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = New Map Bolsters Case for Ancient Ocean on Mars | date = 23 November 2009 | url = http://www.space.com/7584-map-bolsters-case-ancient-ocean-mars.html | work = Space.com | accessdate = 2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2012 using data from [[MARSIS]], a radar on board the [[Mars Express]] orbiter, supports the hypothesis of an extinct large, northern ocean. The instrument revealed a dielectric constant of the surface that is similar to those of low-density sedimentary deposits, massive deposits of ground-ice, or a combination of the two. The measurements were not like those of a lava-rich surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mouginot | first1 = J. | last2 = Pommerol | first2 = A. | last3 = Beck | first3 = P. | last4 = Kofman | first4 = W. | last5 = Clifford | first5 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dielectric map of the Martian northern hemisphere and the nature of plain filling materials | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 39 | issue = 2| page = L02202 | doi = 10.1029/2011GL050286 | bibcode=2012GeoRL..39.2202M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, scientists stated that evidence exists for an ancient volume of water that could comprise an ocean, likely in the planet's northern hemisphere and about the size of Earth's [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Villanueva G.

Further evidence that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere which would make an ocean more probable came from the MAVEN spacecraft that has been making measurements from Mars orbit.

For how long this body of water was in the liquid form is still unknown, considering the high greenhouse efficiency required to bring water to the liquid phase in Mars at a heliocentric distance of 1.4–1.7 AU. It is now thought that the canyons filled with water, and at the end of the [[Noachian Period]] the Martian ocean disappeared, and the surface froze for approximately 450 million years. Then, about 3.2 billion years ago, lava beneath the canyons heated the soil, melted the icy materials, and produced vast systems of subterranean rivers extending hundreds of kilometers. This water erupted onto the now-dry surface in giant floods.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez 2015"/&gt;

New evidence for a vast northern ocean was published in May 2016. A large team of scientists described how some of the surface in [[Ismenius Lacus quadrangle]] was altered by two [[tsunami]]s. The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean. Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30&amp;nbsp;km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys.  Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30&amp;nbsp;km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events. The parts of Mars studied in this research are [[Chryse Planitia]] and northwestern [[Arabia Terra]].  These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the [[Mare Acidalium quadrangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://astrobiology.com/2016/05/ancient-tsunami-evidence-on-mars-reveals-life-potential.html | title=Ancient Tsunami Evidence on Mars Reveals Life Potential - Astrobiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/1680.pdf | title=Tsunami waves extensively resurfaced the shorelines of an early Martian ocean.   | author=Rodriguez, J., et al. | journal=Scientific Reports / 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference | year=2016 | volume=6 | pages=25106 | doi=10.1038/srep25106| pmid=27196957 | pmc=4872529 | bibcode=2016NatSR...625106R }}[https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25106 version at ''Nature'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornell University]].

Research reported in 2017 found that the [[Water on Mars|amount of water]] needed to develop valley networks, outflow channels, and delta deposits of Mars was larger than the volume of a Martian ocean. The estimated volume of an ocean on Mars ranges from 3 meters to about 2 kilometers GEL ([[Global equivalent layer]]).

In 2018, a team of scientists proposed that Martian oceans appeared very early, before or along with the growth of [[Tharsis]].  Because of this the depth of the oceans would be only half as deep as had been thought. The full weight of Tharsis would have created deep basins, but if the ocean occurred before the mass of Tharsis had formed deep basins, much less water would be needed. Also, the shorelines would not be regular since Tharsis would still be growing and consequently changing the depth of the oceans's basin. As Tharsis volcanoes erupted they added huge amounts of gases into the atmosphere that created a global warming, thereby allowing liquid water to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180319124255.htm Mars' oceans formed early, possibly aided by massive volcanic eruptions].

==Theoretical issues==

===Primordial Martian climate===

The existence of liquid water on the surface of Mars requires both a warmer and thicker [[Atmosphere of mars|atmosphere]].  Atmospheric pressure on the present-day Martian surface only exceeds that of the [[Triple point|triple point of water]] (6.11 hPa) in the lowest elevations; at higher elevations water can exist only as a solid or a vapor (assuming pure water). Annual mean temperatures at the surface are currently less than 210 K, significantly less than what is needed to sustain liquid water.  However, early in its history Mars may have had conditions more conducive to retaining liquid water at the surface.

Early Mars had a carbon dioxide atmosphere similar in thickness to present-day Earth (1000 hPa).&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Michael H | year = 1999 | title = Retention of an atmosphere on early Mars | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 104 | issue = E9| pages = 21897–21909 | doi=10.1029/1999je001048 | bibcode=1999JGR...10421897C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a [[Faint young Sun paradox|weak early Sun]], the [[greenhouse effect]] from a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, if bolstered with small amounts of [[methane]]&lt;ref name=Kasting&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Squyres | first1 = Steven W. | last2 = Kasting | first2 = James F. | year = 1994 | title = Early Mars: How warm and how wet? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 265 | issue = 5173| pages = 744–749 | doi=10.1126/science.265.5173.744| bibcode = 1994Sci...265..744S }}&lt;/ref&gt; or insulating effects of carbon-dioxide-ice clouds,&lt;ref name=Forget&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forget | first1 = F. | last2 = Pierrehumbert | first2 = R.

===Chemistry===

Consideration of chemistry can yield additional insight into the properties of Oceanus Borealis.  With a Martian atmosphere of predominantly carbon dioxide, one might expect to find extensive evidence of carbonate minerals on the surface as remnants from oceanic sedimentation.

===Fate of the ocean===
Given the proposal of a vast primordial ocean on Mars, the fate of the water requires explanation.  As the Martian climate cooled, the surface of the ocean would have frozen.  One hypothesis states that part of the ocean remains in a frozen state buried beneath a thin layer of rock, debris, and dust on the flat northern plain [[Vastitas Borealis]].&lt;ref name=Janhunen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janhunen | first1 = P. | authorlink = Janhunen, P. | year = 2002 | title = Are the northern plains of Mars a frozen ocean? | doi = 10.1029/2000je001478| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 107 | issue = E11| page = 5103 | bibcode = 2002JGRE..107.5103J }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water could have also been absorbed into the subsurface cryosphere&lt;ref name=Clifford /&gt; or been lost to the atmosphere (by sublimation) and eventually to space through atmospheric sputtering.&lt;ref name=Kass /&gt;

==Alternate explanations==
The existence of a primordial Martian ocean remains controversial among scientists. The [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'s [[High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment]] (HiRISE) has discovered large boulders on the site of the ancient seabed, which should contain only fine sediment.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Richard A | year = 2007 | title = Is Mars Looking Drier and Drier for Longer and Longer? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5845| page = 1673 | doi=10.1126/science.317.5845.1673 | pmid=17885108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boulders could have been dropped by [[iceberg]]s, a process common on Earth.&lt;ref name = "Fairén"&gt;{{Cite conference

[[File:Polymer brush (SCHEMATIC) V1.svg|thumb|100px|Sample polymer brush]]

A '''polymer brush''' is the name given to a surface coating consisting of [[polymer]]s tethered to a surface.&lt;ref name="Milner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Milner | first1 =  S. T. | title =  Polymer Brushes | journal =  Science | volume =  251 | issue =  4996 | pages =  905–14 | date =  1991 | pmid =  17847384 | doi =  10.1126/science.251.4996.905|bibcode = 1991Sci...251..905M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brush may be either in a solvated state, where the tethered polymer layer consists of polymer and solvent, or in a melt state, where the tethered chains completely fill up the space available. These polymer layers can be tethered to flat substrates such as silicon wafers, or highly curved substrates such as nanoparticles. Also, polymers can be tethered in high density to another single polymer chain, although this arrangement is normally named a [[polymer bottle brush|bottle brush]].&lt;ref name="Chremos"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chremos | first1 = A | last2 = Douglas | first2 = JF | title = A comparative study of thermodynamic, conformational, and structural properties of bottlebrush with star and ring polymer melts | journal  = J. Chem. Phys. | volume = 149 | pages = 044904 | date = 2018  | doi=10.1063/1.5034794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a separate class of polyelectrolyte brushes, when the polymer chains themselves carry an electrostatic charge.

The brushes are often characterized by the high density of grafted chains. The limited space then leads to a strong extension of the chains. Brushes can be used to stabilize [[colloid]]s, reduce friction between surfaces, and to provide lubrication in artificial [[joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halperin | first1 = A. | last2 = Tirrell | first2 = M. | last3 = Lodge | first3 = T.

== Structure ==

[[File:Tethered polymer chain.svg|thumb|300px|Polymer molecule within a brush. The drawing shows the chain elongation decreasing from the attachment point and vanishing at free end. The "blobs", schematized as circles, represent the (local) length scale at which the statistics of the chain change from a 3D [[random walk]] (at smaller length scales) to a 2D in-plane random walk and a 1D normal directed walk (at larger length scales).]]

Polymer molecules within a brush are stretched away from the attachment surface as a result of the fact that they repel each other (steric repulsion or osmotic pressure). More precisely,&lt;ref name="MWC88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milner | first1 = S. T | last2 = Witten | first2 = T. A | last3 = Cates | first3 = M. E | title = A Parabolic Density Profile for Grafted Polymers | journal = Europhysics Letters (EPL) | volume = 5 | pages = 413 | date = 1988 | doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/5/5/006|bibcode = 1988EL......5..413M }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are more elongated near the attachment point and unstretched at the free end, as depicted on the drawing.

More precisely, within the approximation derived by Milner, Witten, Cates,&lt;ref name="MWC88" /&gt; the average density of all monomers in a given chain is always the same up to a prefactor:

&lt;math&gt;\phi(z,\rho)=\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n(z,\rho)=\frac{2N}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\frac{z}{\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the altitude of the end monomer and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the number of monomers per chain.

The averaged density profile &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; of the end monomers of all attached chains, convoluted with the above density profile for one chain, determines the density profile of the brush as a whole:

&lt;math&gt;\phi(z)=\int_z^\infty \frac{\partial n(z,\rho)}{\partial z}\,\epsilon(\rho)\,{\rm d}\rho&lt;/math&gt;

A '''dry brush''' has a uniform monomer density up to some altitude &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. One can show&lt;ref name="MWC89"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milner | first1 = S. T | last2 = Witten | first2 = T. A | last3 = Cates | first3 = M. E | | title = Effects of polydispersity in the end-grafted polymer brush | journal = Macromolecules | volume = 22 | pages = 853–861 | date = 1989 |bibcode = 1989MaMol..22..853M |doi = 10.1021/ma00192a057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the corresponding end monomer density profile is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\rm dry}(\rho,H)=\frac{\rho/H}{Na\sqrt{1-\rho^2/H^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the monomer size.

The above monomer density profile &lt;math&gt;n(z,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; for one single chain minimizes the total elastic energy of the brush,

&lt;math&gt;U=\int_0^\infty\epsilon(\rho)\,{\rm d}\rho\,\int_0^N\,{\rm d}n\,\frac{kT}{2Na^2}\left(\frac{\partial z(n,\rho)}{\partial n}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

regardless of the end monomer density profile &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhulina|first1=E.B.|last2=Borisov|first2=O.V.|title=Structure and stabilizing properties of grafted polymer layers in a polymer medium|journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|date=July 1991|volume=144|issue=2|pages=507–520|doi=10.1016/0021-9797(91)90416-6|bibcode=1991JCIS..144..507Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gay  | first1 = C. | title = Wetting of a polymer brush by a chemically identical polymer melt | journal = Macromolecules | volume = 30 | pages = 5939–5943 | date = 1997 |bibcode = 1997MaMol..30.5939G |doi = 10.1021/ma970107f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From a dry brush to any brush ==

As a consequence,&lt;ref name="Gay1997" /&gt; the structure of any brush can be derived from the brush density profile &lt;math&gt;\phi(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, the free end distribution is simply a convolution of the density profile with the free end distribution of a dry brush:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\rho)=\int_\rho^\infty -\frac{{\rm d}\phi(H)}{{\rm d}H}\epsilon_{\rm dry}(\rho,H)&lt;/math&gt;.

Correspondingly, the brush elastic free energy is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{F_{\rm el}}{kT}=\frac{\pi^2}{24N^2a^5}\int_0^\infty\left\{-z^3\frac{{\rm d}\phi(z)}{{\rm d}z}\right\}{\rm d}z&lt;/math&gt;.

This method has been used to derive wetting properties of polymer melts on polymer brushes of the same species&lt;ref name="Gay1997" /&gt; and to understand fine interpenetration asymmetries between copolymer lamellae&lt;ref name="Leibler99asym"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leibler | first1 = L | last2 = Gay | first2 = C | last3 = Erukhimovich | first3 = I | title = Conditions for the existence of non-centrosymmetric copolymer lamellar systems | journal = Europhysics Letters (EPL) | volume = 46 | pages = 549–554 | date = 1999 | doi=10.1209/epl/i1999-00277-9|bibcode = 1999EL.....46..549L }}&lt;/ref&gt; that may yield very unusual non-centrosymmetric [[lamellar structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Goldacker99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldacker | first1 = T | last2 = Abetz | first2 = V | last3 = Stadler | first3 = R | last4 = Erukhimovich | first4 = I | last5 = Leibler | first5 = L | title = Non-centrosymmetric superlattices in block copolymer blends | journal = Nature | volume = 398 | pages = 137 | date = 1999 |bibcode = 1999Natur.398..137G |doi = 10.1038/18191 | issue=6723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager''' ('''RHESSI''', originally '''High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager''' or '''HESSI''') is a [[NASA]] solar flare observatory. It is the sixth mission in the [[Small Explorer program]], selected in October 1997&lt;ref name="eoPortal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nugget100"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~tohban/wiki/index.php/RHESSI_-_Concept_to_Fruition |title=RHESSI - Concept to Fruition |publisher=[[Space Sciences Laboratory]] |first=Brian |last=Dennis |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched on 5 February 2002. Its primary mission is to explore the physics of [[particle acceleration]] and energy release in [[solar flare]]s.

HESSI was renamed to RHESSI on 29 March 2002 in honor of [[Reuven Ramaty]], a pioneer in the area of high energy solar physics. RHESSI is the first space mission named after a NASA scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0203/29rhessi/ |title=New solar flare satellite gets renamed, now on line |work=Spaceflight Now |publisher=University of California–Berkeley |date=29 March 2002 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RHESSI was built by [[Spectrum Astro]] for Goddard Space Flight Center and is operated by the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. The [[principal investigator]] from 2002 to 2012 was [[Robert Lin]], who was succeeded by Säm Krucker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/PI_AcceptanceLetter.jpg |subject=RHESSI Principal Investigator Appointment |first=John M. |last=Grunsfeld |recipient=Sämuel Krucker |date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission concept==
RHESSI is designed to image solar flares in energetic photons from soft [[X-ray]]s (~3 keV) to [[gamma ray]]s (up to ~20 MeV) and to provide high resolution spectroscopy up to gamma-ray energies of ~20 MeV. Furthermore, it has the capability to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy with high spectral resolution.

==Scientific objectives==
Researchers believe that much of the energy released during a flare is used to accelerate, to very high energies, electrons (emitting primarily X-rays) and protons and other ions (emitting primarily gamma rays). The new approach of the RHESSI mission is to combine, for the first time, high-resolution imaging in hard X-rays and gamma rays with high-resolution spectroscopy, so that a detailed energy spectrum can be obtained at each point of the image.

This new approach will enable researchers to find out where these particles are accelerated and to what energies. Such information will advance understanding of the fundamental high-energy processes at the core of the solar flare problem.

The primary scientific objective of RHESSI is to understand the following processes that take place in the magnetized plasmas of the solar atmosphere during a flare:
*Impulsive energy release,
*Particle acceleration,
*Particle and energy transport.

These high-energy processes play a major role at sites throughout the universe ranging from magnetospheres to active galaxies. Consequently, the importance of understanding these processes transcends the field of solar physics; it is one of the major goals of space physics and astrophysics.

The high energy processes of interest include the following:
*The rapid release of energy stored in unstable magnetic configurations,
*The equally rapid conversion of this energy into the kinetic energy of hot plasma and accelerated particles (primarily electrons, protons and ions),
*The transport of these particles through the solar atmosphere and into interplanetary space,
*The subsequent heating of the ambient solar atmosphere.

These processes involve:
*Particle energies to many GeV,
*Temperatures of tens or even hundreds of millions of degrees,
*Densities as low as 100 million particles per square cm,
*Spatial scales of tens of thousands of kilometers, and
*Magnetic containment times of seconds to hours.

It is impossible to duplicate these conditions in laboratories on the Earth.

The acceleration of electrons is revealed by hard X-ray and gamma-ray bremsstrahlung while the acceleration of protons and ions is revealed by gamma-ray lines and continuum. The proximity of the Sun means, not only that these high-energy emissions are orders of magnitude more intense than from any other cosmic source, but also that they can be better resolved, both spatially and temporally.

==Imaging==
[[File:Rhessi.jpg|thumb|left|RHESSI observing the Sun]]

Since X-rays are not easily reflected or refracted, imaging in X-rays is difficult.  One solution to this problem is to selectively block the X-rays.  If the X-rays are blocked in a way that depends on the direction of the incoming photons, then it may be possible to reconstruct an image.  The imaging capability of RHESSI is based on a Fourier-transform technique using a set of 9 [[Rotational Modulation Collimator]]s (RMCs) as opposed to mirrors and lenses. Each RMC consist of two sets of widely spaced, fine-scale linear grids.  As the spacecraft rotates, these grids block and unblock any X-rays which may be coming from the Sun modulating the photon signal in time.  The modulation can be measured with a detector having no spatial resolution placed behind the RMC since the spatial information is now stored in the time domain. The modulation pattern over half a rotation for a single RMC provides the amplitude and phase of many spatial Fourier components over a full range of angular orientations but for a small range of spatial source dimensions. Multiple RMCs, each with different slit widths, provide coverage over a full range of flare source sizes. Images are then reconstructed from the set of measured Fourier components in exact mathematical analogy to multi-baseline radio interferometry.

RHESSI provides spatial resolution of 2 arcseconds at X-ray energies from ~4 keV to ~100 keV, 7 arcseconds to ~400 keV, and 36 arcseconds for gamma-ray lines and continuum emission above 1 MeV.

RHESSI can also see gamma rays coming from off-solar directions.  The more energetic gamma rays pass through the spacecraft structure, and impact the detectors from any angle.  This mode is used to observe [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs).  The incoming gamma rays are not modulated by the grids, so positional and imaging information is not recorded.  However, a crude position can still be derived by the fact that the detectors have front and rear pickups.  Also, the detectors near the burst shield the ones away from the burst.  Comparing signal strengths around the nine crystals, and front-to-back, then gives a coarse, two-dimensional position in space.

When combined with high-resolution time stamps of the detector hits, the RHESSI solution can be [[multilateration|cross-referenced]] on the ground with other spacecraft in the IPN (Interplanetary Network) to provide a fine solution.  The large area and high sensitivities of the Ge crystal assembly make RHESSI a formidable IPN component.  Even when other spacecraft can provide burst locations, few can provide as high-quality spectra of the burst (in both time and energy) as RHESSI.

Rarely, however, a GRB occurs near the Sun, in the collimated field of view.  The grids then provide full information, and RHESSI can provide a fine GRB location even without IPN correlation.

==Spacecraft and instrument==
The entire spacecraft rotates to provide the necessary signal modulation.  The four, fixed solar panels are designed to provide enough gyroscopic moment to stabilize rotation about the solar vector.  This largely eliminates the need for attitude control.

The instrument detectors are nine high-purity [[germanium]] crystals.  Each is cooled to cryogenic temperatures by a mechanical cryocooler. Germanium provides not only detections by the [[photoelectric effect]], but inherent spectroscopy through the charge deposition of the incoming ray.  The crystals are housed in a cryostat, and mounted with low-conductivity straps.

A tubular telescope structure forms the bulk of the spacecraft. Its purpose is to hold the collimators above the Ge crystals at known, fixed positions.

==Results==
RHESSI observations have changed our perspective on solar flares, particularly on high-energy processes in flares.  RHESSI observations has led to numerous publications in scientific journals and presentations at conferences. {{As of|2008|09}}, RHESSI is mentioned in 970 publications, books, and presentations (as listed on NASA ADS). Between February 2006 to 2008, 200 publications have been published about RHESSI observations.

*RHESSI was the first satellite to image gamma rays from a solar flare.&lt;ref name="gammarayimage"&gt;{{cite journal |title=First Gamma-Ray Images of a Solar Flare |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first1=G.

*RHESSI was the first satellite to accurately measure [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es that come from [[thunderstorm]]s, and RHESSI found that such flashes occur more often than thought and the gamma rays have a higher [[frequency]] on average than the average for cosmic sources.

The '''Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion''' is a sequence of reports sponsored by [[WMO]]/[[UNEP]]. The most recent is the [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/ozone/ 2014 report].
The reports were set up to inform the [[Montreal Protocol]] and amendments about [[ozone depletion]].

== Background ==
{{main|Ozone depletion and global warming}}
The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established.&lt;ref name = RG&gt;[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_book/mpifg_bd_39.pdf ''Technische Problemlösung, Verhandeln und umfassende Problemlösun''g, (eng. technical trouble shooting, negotiating and generic problem solving capability)] in Gesellschaftliche Komplexität und kollektive Handlungsfähigkeit (Societys complexity and collective ability to act), ed.

== Findings ==

=== Changes in Ozone-Depleting Compounds ===

* In the [[troposphere]] observations show that the total abundance of ozone-depleting compounds continues to decline slowly from the peak that occurred in 1992-1994.
* Observations in the [[stratosphere]] indicate that the total chlorine abundance is at or near a peak, while bromine abundances are probably still increasing.
* Analyses of air trapped in snow since the late 19th century have confirmed that non-industrial sources of the CFCs, halons, and major chlorocarbons were insignificant. The data suggest that substantial natural sources exist for atmospheric [[methyl bromide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br).
* The abundances of HCFCs in the [[troposphere]] continue to increase.
* water vapour is a greenhouse gas that has a greater overall effect on the ozone layer than carbon dioxide because of its higher concentrations but is not affected by human activities as it is caused mainly by evaporation and condensation rates.

=== Changes in the Ozone Layer over the Poles and Globally ===

* Springtime Antarctic ozone depletion due to halogens has been large (40-50%; exceptionally 70%) throughout the last decade.
* In some recent cold Arctic winters during the last decade, maximum total column ozone losses due to halogens have reached 30%, but in warmer winters Arctic ozone loss is small.
* Ozone remains depleted in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres. The global-average total column ozone amount for the period 1997-2001 was approximately 3% below the pre-1980 average values.
* Models capture the observed long-term ozone changes in northern and southern midlatitudes.

=== Predictions ===

* Chemistry-climate models predict that springtime Antarctic ozone levels will be increasing by 2010 because of projected decreases of halogens in the stratosphere. A return to pre-1980 total column ozone amounts in the Antarctic is expected by the middle of this century.
* Arctic ozone depletion is highly variable and difficult to predict, but a future Arctic polar ozone hole similar to that of the Antarctic appears unlikely.

=== Changes in Ultraviolet Radiation ===

* Decreases in ozone amounts lead to increases in UV radiation. Calculations of UV irradiance based on relationships with total ozone and total irradiance suggest that UV irradiance has increased since the early 1980s by 6-14% at more than 10 sites distributed over mid- and high latitudes of both hemispheres. But complexities (e.g. clouds, aerosol, snow cover, sea ice cover, and total ozone) limit the ability to describe fully surface ultraviolet radiation on the global scale. Surface ultraviolet data records, which started in the early 1990s, are still too short and too variable to permit the calculation of statistically significant long-term (i.e., multidecadal) trends.
* However, estimates of surface UV radiation from satellite data (ozone and cloud cover) started in November 1978 with the launch of Nimbus-7/TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) followed by Meteor-3/TOMS in 1991, Earth-Probe/TOMS in 1996, and by OMI (Ozone Measuring Instrument on the EOS/AURA spacecraft) in July 2004. These time series are sufficient for estimates of multidecade trends in ozone, cloud cover, and UV irradiance (see [http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov]).  The results clearly show that there have been significant increases in surface UVB at latitudes greater than about 40 degrees (northern US and Canada, most of Europe, Russia, and the southernmost portions of Argentina and Chile). The percent increase depends on the wavelength, with shorter wavelengths showing a larger percent increase.
* Exposure to UV irradiance reaching the Earth's surface is also affected by the amount of cloud cover and by the altitude above sea level.  These factors affect both UVA and UVB in nearly the same manner (less cloud cover or higher altitudes increase UV radiation at the Earth's surface). Some countries, such as Australia, have much less cloud cover than comparable sites in the Northern Hemisphere, and have much greater daily exposure to UV radiation.  Australia, in particular, is known for health effects associated with UV exposure, and has a vigorous public health program to combat this problem. Satellite reflectivity data (TOMS) suggests that some populated regions (e.g., central Europe) have experienced small decreases in cloudiness, which would contribute to overall UV increases.

A '''slough''' ({{IPAc-en|s|l|uː|audio=En-us-slough1.ogg}}&lt;ref name="MWU"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|s|l|aʊ|audio=En-uk-Slough.ogg}})&lt;ref name="MWU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODO"/&gt; is a [[wetland]], usually a [[swamp]] or shallow [[lake]], often a [[Backwater (river)|backwater]] to a larger body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a slough?|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/slough.html|publisher=[[National Ocean Service]]|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water tends to be [[Water stagnation|stagnant]] or may flow slowly on a seasonal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aber|first1=James S.|title=Wetland Definitions and Classification|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/wetland/define/define.htm|website=Wetland Environments|publisher=[[Emporia State University]]|accessdate=5 May 2017|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, "slough" may refer to a side-channel from or feeding a river, or an inlet or natural channel only sporadically filled with water.&lt;ref name="ODO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slough - definition of slough in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/slough|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is [[Finn Slough]] on the [[Fraser River]], whose lower reaches have dozens of notable sloughs.  Some sloughs, like [[Elkhorn Slough]], used to be mouths of rivers, but have become stagnant because tectonic activity cut off the river's source.

In the [[Sacramento River]], [[Steamboat Slough]] was an alternate branch of the river, a preferred shortcut route for [[steamboat]]s passing between [[Sacramento]] and [[San Francisco]].  [[Georgiana Slough]] was a steamboat route through the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]], from the Sacramento River to the [[San Joaquin River]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].

==Plants and animals==

A slough, also called a tidal channel, is a channel in a [[wetland]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Reid Harden|title=California Geology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eL8SAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 May 2017|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-100218-0|pages=369–371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it is either stagnant or slow flowing on a seasonal basis.

Vegetation patterns in a slough are largely determined by [[Depth of field|depth]], distribution, and duration of in the environment. Moreover, these same variables also influence the distribution, abundance, reproduction, and seasonal movements of aquatic and terrestrial life within the sloughs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ogden|first1=John C.|title=Everglades ridge and slough conceptual ecological model|journal=Wetlands|date=December 2005|volume=25|issue=4|pages=810–820|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0810:erasce]2.0.co;2|publisher=[[Society of Wetland Scientists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloughs support a wide variety of plant life that is adapted to rapidly changing physical conditions such as [[salinity]], oxygen levels and depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Devereux Slough - Coal Oil Point Reserve|url=http://copr.nrs.ucsb.edu|publisher=[[University of California Natural Reserve System]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, sloughs are microhabitats high in species diversity. Open water sloughs are characterized by submerged and floating vegetation which includes [[periphyton]] mats dominated by [[Cladium|sawgrass]] typically. The topographical and vegetation heterogeneity of ridge and slough landscape influences the productivity and diversity of birds and fish adapted to that [[wetland]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|authorlink1=National Research Council (United States)|author2=Committee on Restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem|author3=Water Science and Technology Board|title=Does Water Flow Influence Everglades Landscape Patterns?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5XkZE7DfEAC|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=25 July 2003|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08963-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish that typically inhabit sloughs include [[Tidewater goby|tidewater]] goby, California [[killifish]], [[mosquitofish]], and [[topsmelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habitat Restoration Projects|url=http://copr.nrs.ucsb.edu/about/programs/habitat-restoration-projects|website=Coal Oil Point Reserve|publisher=University of California Natural Reserve System|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food habits of fish within sloughs consist of preying upon [[invertebrate]]s; mostly epifaunal [[crustacean]] followed by [[epifaunal]] and [[infaunal]] worms and mollusks. Fish can feed on zooplankton and plant material. Research on prey species for fish in sloughs found that in a study done on [[Elkhorn Slough|Elkhorn Slough in California]] the mean prey richness for fish was greatest near the ocean and lowest inshore. This allows for a higher availability of food to enhance the function of inshore habitats and emphasizes the importance of invertebrate prey populations and how they influence plant production.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernhardt|first1=Christopher E.|last2=Willard|first2=Debra A.|title=Response of the Everglades ridge and slough landscape to climate variability and 20th-century water management|journal=Ecological Applications|date=1 October 2009|volume=19|issue=7|pages=1723–1738|doi=10.1890/08-0779.1|publisher=[[Ecological Society of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird]]s also inhabit sloughs. Sloughs are hotspots for bird watching. For example, the Elkhorn Slough in the western United States is one of the premier bird watching sites in the western United States. Over 340 species are seen visiting including several rare and endangered species. Species of birds seen in sloughs such as the Elkhorn slough include  Acorn [[Woodpecker]], [[Brown pelican|Brown Pelican]], [[Caspian tern|Caspian Tern]], [[Great blue heron|Great BlueHeron]], [[Great egret|Great Egret,]] [[Great horned owl|Great Horned Owl]], [[Snowy plover|Snowy Plover]], and [[White-tailed kite|White-tailed Kite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elkhorn Slough Foundation|title=Elkhorn Slough Birds|url=http://www.elkhornslough.org/sloughlife/birds/|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloughs are largely influenced by human development such as urban and [[agricultural expansion]], industrial and agricultural practices, water management practices, and humans influence on species composition. Uses of identifying these aspects of human involvement can help to better predict restoration efforts to be made in managing sloughs. Examples of attributes that are affected by human stress upon the environment include [[periphyton]], marsh plant communities, tree islands, [[alligator]]s, [[wading birds]], and marsh fishes, [[invertebrate]]s, and [[Herpetology|herpetofauna]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Formation==

A slough can form when a [[meander]] gets cut off from the main river channel creating an [[oxbow lake]] that accumulates with fine overbank sediment and organic material such as [[peat]]. This creates a [[wetland]] or [[swamp]] environment. One end of the oxbow configuration then continues to receive flow from the main channel, creating a slough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mount|first=Jeffrey F.|title=California Rivers and Streams: The Conflict Between Fluvial Process and Land Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YTVgF9sA5MC|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=8 November 1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-91693-7|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloughs are typically associated with the ridge formations found in their presence. Such a landscape consists of mosaic linear ridges, typically of some sort of grass such as [[Cladium|sawgrass]] ridges in the Florida [[Everglades]], that are separated by deeper water sloughs.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Edges of sloughs are layers of [[sediment]] deposited by a river over time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The development of this landscape is thought to occur by the preferential formation of peat in [[bedrock]] depressions. Multiple of these deposits mounted on top of the surrounding bedrock can become elongated alongside the slough and create flow diversions within the system. Different rates of this [[peat]] accumulation could be triggered by variations in microtopography that alter plant production and vegetation type. Water flow might be the key to preventing an accumulation of organic sediment in sloughs due to the fact that accumulation leads to lowering water depths and instead allows for the growth of vegetation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Degradation==

Overall little quantitative data on the degradation of slough landscape exists. Slough and ridge landscape has been greatly degraded in terms of both [[Topography|topographic]] and vegetation changes over time. Topographical changes create an increase in the relief between ridge crests and slough bottoms. Vegetation changes consist of an increase in the amount of dense grass and decrease in the area of open water, creating a blurring of the directional ridge and slough pattern.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Historical everglade and slough landscape has been greatly affected and degraded by human activity. Open water sloughs support important ecological functions that have been seen to be sensitive to hydrologic and water quality problems stemmed from human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCormick|first1=Paul V.|last2=Newman|first2=Susan|last3=Vilchek|first3=Les W.|title=Landscape responses to wetland eutrophication: loss of slough habitat in the Florida Everglades, USA|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=14 November 2008|volume=621|issue=1|pages=105–114|doi=10.1007/s10750-008-9635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==

Sloughs are ecologically important as they are a part of an [[Endangered language|endangered]] environment; wetlands. They act as a buffer from land to sea and act as an active part of the estuary system where freshwater flows from creeks and runoff from the land mix with salty ocean water transported by tides. Restoration is a big effort in California wetlands to restore slough and ridge landscapes. Examples of restoration projects on slough landscapes include The [[Elkhorn Slough]] Tidal Wetland Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elkhorn Slough Foundation|title=Elkhorn Slough Tidal Wetland Project: Restoration Projects|url=http://www.elkhornslough.org/tidalwetland/restorationprojects.htm|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dutch Slough]] Tidal Restoration Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch Slough Tidal Restoration|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/floodsafe/fessro/restoration/dsindex.cfm|website=California Department of Water Resources|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the McDaniel Slough wetland enhancement project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McDaniel Slough Project|url=http://www.cityofarcata.org/227/McDaniel-Slough-Project|website=City of Arcata|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McDaniel Slough wetland enhancement project|url=http://www.appropedia.org/McDaniel_Slough_wetland_enhancement_project|website=[[Appropedia]]|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

'''Soil loss tolerance''' for a specific soil, also known as the '''T value''', is the maximum average annual [[soil loss]] expressed as tons per acre per year that will permit current production levels to be maintained economically and indefinitely.  T values range from 1 to 5 tons per acre per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwr.msu.edu/rusle/tvalue.htm|title=T Value|publisher=NRCS-USDA State Office of Michigan|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[National Resource Conservation Service]], in 2007 in the US, 99 million acres (28% of all cropland) were eroding above soil loss tolerance (T) rates.  This was compared to 169 million acres (40% of cropland) in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/?ss=16&amp;navtype=SUBNAVIGATION&amp;cid=stelprdb1041887&amp;navid=120110110000000&amp;pnavid=120110000000000&amp;position=Not%20Yet%20Determined.Html&amp;ttype=detail&amp;pname=Soil%20Erosion%20on%20Cropland%202007%20%7C%20NRCS |title=Soil Erosion on Cropland 2007 &amp;#124; NRCS |publisher=Nrcs.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===In the United States===
The idea of soil loss tolerance was initially devised by the SCS (known presently as the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]]). It was based on the minimum soil loss rate required to reduce organic content and harm crop productivity. In its early stages of development, soil loss tolerance rates were inconsistent because they were obtained based on rough estimates. From 1961 to 1962, several groups of soil in the United States were designated with T rates ranging from 2 to 6 tons per acre per year. The rate was subsequently adjusted to 1 to 5 tons per acre per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Frederick R. Troeh, J. Arthur Hobbs &amp; Roy L. Donahue|title=Soil and Water Conservation for Productivity and Environmental Protection|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=4th|year=2003|page=129|isbn=978-0130968074}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value was adapted for use in conservation management beginning in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

'''''The Mole People''''' is a 1956 American [[black-and-white]] [[science fiction film]] distributed by [[Universal International]], which was produced by [[William Alland]], directed by [[Virgil W. Vogel]], and stars [[John Agar]], [[Hugh Beaumont]], and [[Cynthia Patrick]]. The story is written by [[László Görög (writer)|László Görög]]. The film was released on December 1, 1956&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mole_people/&lt;/ref&gt;, on a double feature with their jungle adventure film ''[[Curucu, Beast of the Amazon]]''&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). "You Won't Believe Your Eyes". Bear Manor Media. {{ISBN|978-1-59393-273-2}}. Page 254&lt;/ref&gt;. It has also been featured on an episode on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

==Plot==
A narration by [[Frank C. Baxter|Dr. Frank Baxter]], an English professor at the [[University of Southern California]], explains the premise of the movie and its basis in reality. He briefly discusses the [[hollow earth]] theories of [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.|John Symmes]] and [[Cyrus Teed]] among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories.

[[Archaeologist]]s Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of [[Sumer]]ian [[albino]]s living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid [[mole (animal)|mole]] men as their slaves to harvest [[mushroom]]s, which serve as their primary food source because mushrooms can grow without sunlight (although the principles of thermodynamics would in reality prevent a fungus-based diet or other diet without input from [[photosynthesis]] from being sustainable on a trans-generational basis). The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. They believe the men are messengers of Ishtar, their goddess. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of [[Ishtar]]. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] skin who is disdained by the others since she has the "mark of darkness."

When one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye of Ishtar just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize it is really natural light coming from the surface and that the men had survived. They then climb to the surface. Unfortunately, Adad dies after reaching the surface, when an earthquake causes a column to fall over and crush her.

==Cast==
*[[John Agar]] as Dr. Roger Bentley
*Cynthia Patrick as Adad
*[[Hugh Beaumont]] as Dr. Jud Bellamin
*[[Alan Napier]] as Elinu, the High Priest
*[[Nestor Paiva]] as Prof. Etienne Lafarge
*[[Phil Chambers]] as Dr. Paul Stuart
*[[Rodd Redwing]] as Nazar
*[[Robin Hughes]] as First Officer
*[[Frank C. Baxter|Frank Baxter]] as Himself

==Reception==
The film currently has a 4.8/10 rating on [[IMDb]], 1.5/5 rating on [[AllMovie]], and an audience score of 27% on the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 2.6/5, based on 542 reviews.

==Home media==
Universal first released ''The Mole People'' on [[VHS]] on June 30, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mole_people/&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, the film was then released on [[DVD]] in a boxed set called ''The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection'', which features 4 other films (''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', ''[[The Monolith Monsters]]'', and ''[[Monster on the Campus]]''). Universal then re-released this film in 2015 as a stand-alone DVD as part of its ''Universal Vault Series''. There is also a Region 2 DVD release of this film.

==In other media==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2016}}
This movie was featured on the television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The characters respond to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending by bitterly declaring "And no one trusted a John Agar movie again."; the ending was changed from a typical happily-ever-after scenario because members of the studio felt that Bently's romance with Adad would promote interracial relationships.

A segment of this movie was used for the 1968 movie ''[[The Wild World of Batwoman]]'', as creatures created by one of the movie's villains. This use was itself parodied by Mystery Science Theater 3000, with [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]] mocking the classic slogan for [[Reese's]] Peanut Butter cups followed by [[Michael J. Nelson|Mike Nelson]] imitating the movie's villain, proclaiming "That's enough of THAT film."

==Mythology==
[[File:Kudurru Melishipak Louvre Sb23 Ishtar-star.jpg|thumb|One version of the star symbol of Inanna / Ishtar.]]
The fictionalized Mesopotamian history presented by the movie is based largely on [[Panbabylonism]], as both Sumerian and Judaic stories describe the same events of the movie. Dr. Bentley states that the [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]] is an established archaeological fact, and the stranding of the Sumerians atop the mountain is a reference to the tale of [[Noah's Ark]].

Similarly to the protagonists of the movie [[Ishtar]] descends to the underworld.&lt;ref name="Jastrow"&gt;[[#Reference-Jastrow|Jastrow]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Panbabylonic connection between Ishtar’s descent and the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The [[descent to the underworld]] is a common story of world mythologies, as is the [[flood myth]].

The movie erroneously associates Ishtar and the Sumerians. Ishtar was the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] counterpart of the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]]. The imagery associated with Ishtar in the movie is entirely fictional: Ishtar’s symbol was an eight-pointed star&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary'' by Jeremy Black and Anthony Green (1992, {{ISBN|0-292-70794-0}}), p. 156, pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; representing Venus rather than the uneven chevron in the movie. Viewers might also notice that all of the gods depicted on the temple walls are Egyptian, not Sumerian.

[[Adad]] is an Akkadian (male) storm-god, counterpart to the Sumerian Ishkur.

The '''three-mile limit''' refers to a traditional and now largely obsolete conception of the [[international law]] of the seas which defined a country's [[territorial waters]], for the purposes of trade regulation and exclusivity, as extending as far as the reach of [[cannon]]s fired from land. (Improvements in cannons eventually allowed them to be able to fire a shell more than three miles, but Earth's curvature made this moot. From a height of a few meters above sea level (say, atop the wall of a coastal fort), the horizon is only about {{convert|3|nmi|km}} away. Thus there was no need to be able to shoot farther, since more distant targets would not be visible.)

In ''[[Mare clausum]]'' (1635) [[John Selden]] endeavoured to prove that the sea was in practice virtually as capable of appropriation as terrestrial territory. As conflicting claims grew out of the controversy, maritime states came to modulate their demands and base their maritime claims on the principle that it extended seawards from land. A workable formula was found by [[Cornelius Bynkershoek]] in his ''De dominio maris'' (1702), restricting maritime dominion to the actual distance within which cannon range could effectively protect it. Most maritime nations adopted this principle, which developed into a limit of {{convert|3|nmi|km}}. (It has also been suggested that the three-mile limit derived, at least in some cases, from the general application of the [[League (unit)|league]] (a common unit of measurement at sea) rather than from the range of cannon.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kent |first1=H. S. K. |year=1954 |title=The Historical Origins of the Three-Mile Limit |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=537–553 |publisher=American Society of International Law |doi= 10.2307/2195021|jstor=2195021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-20th century, numerous nations have claimed territorial waters well beyond the traditional three-mile limit. Commonly these maritime territories extend {{convert|12|nmi|km}} from a [[coastline]], and this was eventually established as the international norm by the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. As a result, the three-mile limit has become largely obsolete. {{As of|2007}}, only [[Gibraltar]], [[Jordan]], [[Palau]], and [[Singapore]] retain it.

[[File:NorthIndiaCircuit 250.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Triveni Sangam, the intersection of Yamuna River and [[Ganges River]]]] 
In [[Hindu]] tradition '''Triveni Sangam''' is the "[[confluence]]" of three rivers. ''Sangam'' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for confluence. The point of confluence is a sacred place for [[Hinduism|Hindus]]. A bath here is said to flush away all of one's sins and free one from the cycle of rebirth.

==Triveni Sangam in Allahabad==

[[File:Triveni Sangam.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Pilgrims at the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of the [[Ganges]] , [[Yamuna]] and a third unseen one, the [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati River]], in [[Allahabad]].]]

One such Triveni Sangam, in [[Allahabad]], has the confluence of two rivers — the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yamuna]]. The two rivers maintain their visible identity and can be identified by their different colours. The water of the [[Ganges]] is clear, while that of the [[Yamuna]] is greenish in colour.&lt;ref name="Triveni Sangam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prayagdarshan.com/triveni-sangam.html | title=Triveni Sangam | accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A place of religious importance and the site for historic [[Kumbh Mela]] held every 12 years, over the years it has also been the site of immersion of ashes of several national leaders, including [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798222,00.html At the Three Rivers] ''[[TIME]]'', 23 February 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

The auspiciousness of the confluence of two rivers referred to in one of the latest sections of the [[Rigveda]], which says,"Those who bathe at the place where the two rivers flow together, rise up to heaven"{{cn|date=July 2018}}.

==Other Triveni Sangams==

===Bhagamandala===
{{main|Bhagamandala}}
Bhagamandala is a pilgrimage place in [[Kodagu]] district of [[Karnataka]]. It is situated on the river [[Kaveri]] in its upstream stretches. At this place, the Kaveri is joined by two tributaries, the Kannike and the mythical Sujyoti river. It is considered sacred as a river confluence (''kudala'' or ''triveni sangama'', in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]] respectively).

===Erode===
{{main|Kooduthurai}}
The Triveni Sangam in [[Erode]] is a confluence of 3 rivers, the Cauvery, Bhavani and Amudha. Of these three, the river Amudha is invisible and is said to flow underground and join the other two rivers from below. It is also called as [[Kooduthurai]], where the famous [[Sangameswarar Temple]] is located.

===Tirumakudalu Narasipura===
{{main|Tirumakudalu Narasipura}}
Tirumakudalu Narasipura, commonly known as T. Narasipura,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysore.nic.in/photographs/tnp_gp_vill_bnd.pdf Gram Panchayat and Taluk Boundary Map]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[panchayat town]] in [[Mysore district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]]. The first name refers to the land at the confluence, (trimakuta in Sanskrit) at the confluence of the [[Kaveri]], [[Kabini]] and Spatika Sarovara (a mythical lake or spring, also named Gupta Gamini). This is the place in [[South India]] where local Kumbhamela is held every three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/karnataka/preparations-on-for-regional-version-of-kumbh-mela/article4307593.ece |title=The Hindu : States / Karnataka : Preparations on for regional version of Kumbh mela |first=R.

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia''' is a Multilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] and entered into effect on 3 October 2008 under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. The MoU covers 29 range States (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Portugal (Madeira and Azores), São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain (Canary Islands) and Togo).&lt;ref&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;OYT&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:WATCH I meeting in Adeje, Tenerife, Spain, October 2007.jpg|thumb|240px|WATCH I meeting, Adeje, Tenerife, October 2007]]
In May 2000 a workshop on “Conservation and Management of small cetaceans of the coast of Africa” was held in [[Conakry, Guinea]]. It was during this workshop that the idea of developing an action plan for the conservation of West African small cetaceans and manatees was launched. The meeting was attended by representatives of seven range States (Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gambia and Togo) alongside international experts. The Conference of the Parties to the CMS Convention adopted two resolutions (Resolution 7.7&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 7.7: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop7/proceedings/pdf/en/part_I/Res_Rec/RES_7_07_Agreements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.5&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 8.5: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop8/documents/proceedings/pdf/eng/CP8Res_8_05_Review_ArticleIV_Agreements_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) and one recommendation (Recommendation 7.3&lt;ref&gt;Recommendation 7.3: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop7/proceedings/pdf/en/part_I/Res_Rec/REC_7_03_Cetaceans_Sirenians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) at its Seventh and Eight meeting in respectively 2002 and 2005, to support the development of a CMS instrument on these species as well as Action Plans.
[[File:WATCH II meeting, Lomé, Togo, October 2008.JPG|thumb|240px|WATCH II meeting, Lomé, Togo, October 2008]]
A first negotiation meeting, called WATCH I (Western African Talks on Cetaceans and their Habitats), held in [[Adeje, Spain|Adeje, Tenerife, Spain]] in October 2007 further elaborated on a MoU.&lt;ref&gt;Report WATCH I: http://www.cms.int/species/waam/watch1_docs/WATCH_I_Report_E_withAnnexes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  One year later, 2–3 October 2008, WATCH II meeting was held in [[Lomé, Togo]].&lt;ref&gt;Report WATCH II: http://www.cms.int/species/waam/watch2_docs/report_incl_annexes_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the final negotiation and signing of the MoU took place, including the adoption of two Action Plans, which are annexes to the MoU. The MoU was signed by 15 range States and four organizations and came into effect immediately. Later on, two other range States as well as two organizations also signed the MoU, bringing the total to 23.

Signatories to the West African Aquatic Mammals MoU:
* Angola (3 October 2008)
* Benin (3 October 2008)
* Cape Verde (3 October 2008)
* Chad (3 October 2008)
* Congo (3 October 2008)
* Côte d'Ivoire (3 October 2008)
* Equatorial Guinea (3 October 2008)
* Gabon (3 October 2008)
* Ghana (3 October 2008)
* Guinea-Bissau (3 October 2008)
* Liberia (3 October 2008)
* Mali (3 October 2008)
* Mauritania (3 October 2008)
* Niger (3 October 2008)
* Togo (3 October 2008)
* Portugal (5 December 2008)
* Guinea (8 December 2008)

In addition, the following organizations have signed the MoU:
* [[Wetlands International|Wetlands International Africa]] (3 October 2008)
* [[The Wildlife Trusts|Wildlife Trust]] (3 October 2008)
* GSM (Society for the Conservation of Marine Mammals) (3 October 2008)
* CMS Secretariat (3 October 2008)
* [[WDCS]] (5 December 2008)
* [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (5 December 2008)

== Aim of MoU ==
Direct and incidental catch, coastal development, pollution, over-fishing and habitat degradation are the most immediate threats for West African marine mammal population, causing a rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;Project GloBAL (Global Bycatch Assessment of Long-lived Species): http://bycatch.nicholas.duke.edu/regions/WestAfrica&lt;/ref&gt; The MoU aims to protect these species at a national, regional and global level. Efforts to protect marine mammals and raise awareness of their conservation needs include convening of meetings, undertaking of studies and filed activities, adoption of legal instruments, as well as the development of international agreements.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU protects the [[West African manatee]] ''(Trichechus senegalensis)'' and all populations of small [[cetaceans]] including the endemic [[Atlantic humpback dolphin]] ''(Sousa teuszi)''. About thirty species are thought to occur in the region of West Africa and [[Macaronesia]].

== Fundamental components ==
Concerned by the conservation status of the manatees and small cetacean populations frequently visiting the coastal and inland waters of the region’s Western African range States, the range States decide to work closely together to achieve and maintain a favorable conservation status for the species and their habitats. To this end they will, individually or collectively:&lt;ref&gt;Text of West African Aquatic Mammals Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/waam/MoU_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Take steps as range States for the respective species to conserve manatees and small cetaceans and fully protect those species listed in CMS Appendix I that occur in the region
# Consider, as appropriate, ratifying or acceding to those biodiversity-related international instruments that complement the intent of the MoU, including in particular CMS, so as to enhance the legal protection of the species
# Enact or update, as appropriate, legislation and enforce it to conserve the species concerned
# Implement the provisions of the Action Plans attached as annexes to the MoU
# Facilitate the rapid exchange of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to coordinate conservation measures, and cooperate with recognized experts and collaborating organizations to facilitate the work conducted in relation to the Action Plans
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and Action Plans at regular meetings
# Submit regularly to the Secretariat reports on implementation of the MoU

The MoU took effect following the signature by the seventh range State (3 October 2008) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all other Signatories.

== Meetings ==
Meetings of Signatories are organized regularly to review the conservation status of manatees and small cetaceans and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plans. National reports by individual Signatories and a report prepared by the secretariat are also submitted. As of August 2012, the first Meeting of Signatories is yet to take place.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. The secretariat organizes the regular meetings and prepares overview report compiled on the basis of information at its disposal.

== Action Plans ==
The MoU is accompanied by two Action Plans, one for manatees and one for small cetaceans.

'''The Acton Plan for the African manatee''', the least intensively studied of the Sirenians, aims to improve legislation for manatee protection, improve applied research, reduce pressures and promote a wide appreciation of the animal and their ecological and cultural value through communication and education.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan for African manatee: http://www.cms.int/species/waam/manatee_ap_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Action Plan for small cetaceans''' contains eight thematic sections: National, Regional and International Collaboration and Cooperation; Legislation and Policy; Ecosystem/Habitat Protection; Threat Reduction; Research and Monitoring; Capacity Building; Education and Awareness; Tourism Based on Small Cetaceans.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan for small cetaceans: http://www.cms.int/species/waam/smcet_ap_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Possibilities are being explored for the development of sub-regional implementation plans, probably through one or more workshops and potentially in collaboration with the University of Ghana. Meanwhile, Guinea has developed Action Plans based on those in the MoU for use in its own context at national level. A database tool modeled on that for [[Pacific Islands Cetaceans Memorandum of Understanding|the Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU]] is being developed by WDCS. Furthermore, an exploratory survey of cetaceans and their status in Cameroon was carried out in 2011, with support from the CMS Small Grants Programme. Finally, two projects are being explored, one for developing a [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]] project for implementation of the MoU and one for the establishment of a Technical Advisory Group for the MoU.

The [[palaearctic]] '''Western European broadleaf forests''' is an [[ecoregion]], in the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[Biome]], that covers a large area in [[Western Europe]] including: [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]]  and [[Czech Republic]].

==Geography==
The total Western European broadleaf forests area is around {{convert|490000|km²|0|abbr=on}}. In particular the ecoregion is found in the [[Massif Central]], Central German Uplands, [[Jura Mountains]], Bavarian Plateau, and [[Bohemian Massif]]. It is essentially composed of lowland and alti-[[Montane forest|montane]] [[beech]] and mixed beech forests. It also includes small part of sub-Mediterranean regions.

==Habitation==
This area has been inhabited for thousands of years. It hosts large cities ([[Lyon]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Munich]]), some forests, but most of the countryside is agricultural land, cultivated with [[cereal]]s ([[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[oat]]s). This ecoregion hosts a good variety of animal species, birds in particular, but most large mammals are in decline.

'''Willem Cornelisz Schouten''' ({{circa|lk=no|1567}} – 1625) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[navigator]] for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He was the first to sail the [[Cape Horn]] route to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Le Maire en Schouten - Reis via Kaap Hoorn naar Indie 1615-1616.png|thumb|left|Route of the 1615–1616 voyage]]

Willem Cornelisz Schouten was born in c. 1567 in [[Hoorn]], [[Holland]], [[Seventeen Provinces]].

In 1615 Willem Cornelisz Schouten and his younger brother Jan Schouten  sailed from [[Texel]] in the [[Netherlands]], in an expedition led by [[Jacob Le Maire]] and sponsored by [[Isaac Le Maire]] and his ''Australische Compagnie'' in equal shares with Schouten.  The expedition consisted of two ships: ''Eendracht'' and ''Hoorn''.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', pp. 222–33&lt;/ref&gt; A main purpose of the voyage was to search for ''[[Terra Australis]]''. A further objective was to explore a western route to the [[Pacific Ocean]] to evade the trade restrictions of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in the  [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1616 Schouten rounded [[Cape Horn]], which he named after the recently destroyed ship ''Hoorn'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;there was no loss of life in the bungled cleaning/burning attempt in Patagonia of the hull of ''Hoorn'' as recorded in Schouten’s journal ''The Relation''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch city of [[Hoorn]], after which the lost ship was named, the town in which Schouten himself was born. Schouten named the strait itself "Le Maire Strait". Jan Schouten died on 9 March 1616 after the expedition left [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]].&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; He crossed the Pacific along a southern role, discovering a number of atolls in the [[Tuamotu Islands]], including [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihi]], [[Rangiroa]] and [[Takapoto]], followed by [[Tafahi]], [[Niuafoʻou]] and [[Niuatoputapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]], and [[Alofi Island|Alofi]] and [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]] in the [[Wallis and Futuna Islands]].&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; He then followed the north coasts of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Guinea]] and visited adjacent islands, including what became known as the [[Schouten Islands]] before reaching [[Ternate]] in September 1616.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt;

Although he had opened an unknown route (south of Cape Horn) for the Dutch, the VOC claimed infringement of its monopoly of trade to the Spice Islands. Schouten was arrested (and later released) and his ship confiscated in [[Java (island)|Java]]. On his return he would sail again for the VOC, and on one of these trips he died off the coast of [[Madagascar]] in 1625.

[[Abel Tasman]] later used Shouten's charts during his exploration of the north coast of New Guinea.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt;

Schouten described his travels in the ''Journal,'' published in a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] edition at [[Amsterdam]] in 1618 and soon translated into several other languages.
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] edition: ''Journael ofte beschrijvinghe van de wonderlijcke reyse, gedaen door Willem Cornelisz. Schouten van Hoorn, in de Jaren 1615. 1616. en 1617: hoe hy bezuyden de straet van Magellanes een nieuwe passagie ofte strate, tot in de groote Zuyd-zee, ontdeckt, ende voort den geheelen aerdt-kloot omgezeylt heeft: wat eylanden, vreemde volcken en wonderlijcke avontueren hem ontmoet zijn.'' Amsterdam: Willem Jansz. 1618.
* [[French language|French]] edition: ''Journal ou Description du marveilleux voyage de Guilliaume Schouten'' ... Amsterdam: Willem Jansz. 1618.
* [[English language|English]] edition: ''The Relation of a Wonderfull Voiage made by Willem Cornelison Schouten of Horne. Shewing how South from the Straights of Magelan in Terra Delfuego: he found and discovered a newe passage through the great South Seaes, and that way sayled round about the world''. London: Imprinted by T.D. for Nathanaell Newbery. 1619.
* [[German language|German]] edition: ''Journal, oder Beschreibung der wunderbaren Reise W. Schouten auss Hollandt, im Jahr 1615–17 ...'' Frankfurt am Main. 1619.
* [[Latin]] edition: ''Novi Freti, a parte meridionali freti Magellanici in Magnum Mare Australe Detectio. Diarium vel descriptio laboriosissimi et molestissimi itineris, facti a Guilielmo Cornii Schoutenio annis 1615–17...'' Amsterdam: Janson. 1619.

Among historians, including [[A. L. Rowse]], there is no consensus about the authorship of this ''Journal''. Schouten has got the credit for it, and thus the voyage has come down to us under his name. The Dutch, French, German and Latin texts all have nine engraved maps and plates which are not present in the English version, ''THE RELATION''.
