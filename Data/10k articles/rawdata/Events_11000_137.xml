The '''2006 Dalit Bisaya''' (officially '''Dalit Bisaya: A Cebu Visayan Cultural Festival''') was a series of exhibits, cultural shows, and a symposium, sponsored by the Kapunongang Bisaya sa Manila and hosted by the [[University of San Carlos]] ([[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]]). It ran from December 1 to 3, 2006, with the activities held in SM Cebu and campuses of the host university. The tagline was ''Panaghiusa Pinaagi sa Kultura'' (Unity through Culture).

Various groups have thought of holding a Bisaya or [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]-[[Visayan]] [[cultural festival]] in [[Cebu]]. In 1999 the [[Kapunongang Bisaya sa Kadak-ang Manila]] under Gen. [[Lisandro Abadia]] ang [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Marcelo Fernan]] discussed a plan for it. Later in 1999 and 2000 another and a larger group led by Atty. [[Napoleon Rama]] and Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] made detailed plans for a Visayan concert in Cebu and adopted a plan to form the Kulturang Bisaya Foundation to support its cultural activities.

The 2006 Dalit Bisaya was orchestrated by a group composed of [[Jesus Alcordo]], Dr. Magdaleno Albarracin, Dr. [[Jose Abueva]], Dr. [[Francisco Nemenzo]], Baltazar Endriga and Yolanda Bacani.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19442">The [[Southeastern Conference]] 2009 [[college football]] season was particularly controversial.  Many coaches have complained about the officiating, and the conference has had to alter the punishments for violations of some of the rules.

==Games==

===Alabama-LSU===
On November 7, 2009, the LSU Tigers played against the Alabama Crimson Tide, and Alabama won the game, with the final score at 24-15.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this game, there was a controversial call dealing with a pass by Alabama quarterback [[Greg McElroy]] when there were just under six minutes left in the game and Alabama was ahead by six points, with the score at 21-15; LSU’s [[Patrick Peterson]] believed that he had secured the ball before going out of bounds, which would have made it an interception rather than an incomplete pass.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[[#Reference-idCasagrande2009|Casagrande, Michael.  "Saban defends SEC officials after LSU game."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ruling on the field was confirmed after an official review, and it remained an incomplete pass.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;  There was no “indisputable video evidence”&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[[#Reference-idZenor2009|Zenor, John.  "SEC's season one of contenders and complaints."]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the instant replay official to overturn the call.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;
Unlike Bobby Petrino, Dan Mullen, Lane Kiffin, and Urban Meyer, neither Alabama head coach [[Nick Saban]] nor LSU head coach [[Les Miles]] made negative comments about the officiating.  Saban acknowledged that the officials work very hard and do their best to get all of the calls right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;  Miles pointed out that the officials were doing the best that they could.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;   Javier Arenas, one of Alabama’s players, agreed with these coaches and stated that the referees have a very difficult job to do.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

===Alabama-Tennessee===
The Tennessee Volunteers played against the Alabama Crimson Tide, who was #1 coming into the game, on October 24, 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[[#Reference-idCollege2009|"College Football Scoreboard."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tennessee head coach [[Lane Kiffin]] believed that Alabama’s [[Terrence Cody]] should have been penalized for unsportsmanlike behavior when he took off his helmet and threw it after he blocked a field goal on the last play of the game.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[#Reference-idSEC2009|"SEC reprimands Kiffin, Mullen for knocking refs."]]&lt;/ref&gt; This gave Alabama a win, with the final score at 12-10.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  Kiffin complained about this to the Southeastern Conference, stating that he decided to run the clock down at the end because he was afraid that the officiating would prevent Tennessee from making much progress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; After he made that comment, he stated that he was certain that he would receive “one of those letters that really means nothing as Bobby [Petrino] got last week, but Alabama and Florida live on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;[[#Reference-idRusso2009|Russo, Ralph D.  "SEC Stiffens Penalties for Complaining Coaches."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Slive responded by giving Kiffin a public reprimand, and the Southeastern Conference did not recognize the possible bad call.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  Slive also stated, “Coach Kiffin is on notice that for any further violation of SEC policies will subject him to additional penalties including suspension”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  If Kiffin or another member of the University of Tennessee staff makes any more public comments such as these comments relating to the officiating, then Kiffin will be suspended for at least one game and the University of Tennessee could be fined.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;  Kiffin had already been reprimanded once this year, after he accused Florida Gators head coach [[Urban Meyer]] of breaking some rules concerning recruiting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  Kiffin and Meyer have had a lot of conflict this season as well, causing Slive to have to talk to both coaches about it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  After this new threat of suspension, Kiffin has not commented on the SEC’s recent changes in penalties for public criticism of officials.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  The SEC explained after the game why Cody and Alabama were not penalized:  The foul for removing your helmet is treated as a dead ball foul (even if it occurs while the play is live) and assessed on the next play; since time expired on that play, there was no next play and thus no penalty.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2009/10/no-penalty-for-tide-player-taking-helmet-off/1#.WEWWecnMfps&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkansas-Florida===
Arkansas played at Florida on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;   In this game, officials called a personal foul on [[Malcolm Sheppard]], a defensive lineman for Arkansas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[[#Reference-idWhiteside2009|Whiteside, Kelly.  "Officials taking hits over recent misses."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there was no video evidence for this penalty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[#Reference-idDirocco2009|Dirocco, Michael.  "SEC official defends referees."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, Florida won the game 23-20.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;    After [[Bobby Petrino]], the head coach for the Arkansas Razorbacks, publicly commented on these calls, [[Michael Slive]], the Southeastern Conference Commissioner, gave him a public reprimand.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

===Georgia-Florida===
The Georgia Bulldogs played against the Florida Gators on October 31, 2009, and were defeated, with the final score at 41-17.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  After this game, Urban Meyer believed that a flag should have been called on Georgia linebacker Nick Williams for “knocking [[Tebow]] to the ground well after he had gotten rid of the football”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;[[#Reference-idFines2009|"SEC fines Meyer $30,000."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tebow had handed the ball off to [[Jeff Demps]] and was watching the play when Williams hit him, before the play was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFlorida2009|Dirocco, Michael.  "Florida coach Urban Meyer is fined $30.000 by SEC."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview, Meyer stated that he believed that there should have been a flag on that play and acknowledged that that was one of the plays that he sent in for review.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idBarnhart2009|Barnhart, Tony.  "SEC made right call on Meyer."]]&lt;/ref&gt;
After he stated this, Michael Slive announced that Meyer had violated the code of ethics for the Southeastern Conference and that “SEC bylaw 10.5.4 clearly states that the coaches, players, and support personnel shall refrain from public criticism of officials.” &lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;  Meyer was fined $30,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;  He was the first to be fined under the harsher new penalties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Meyer responded by saying that he respected the league and its commissioner, and that he had not intended to criticize the official after being asked a question about that play.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;  He then apologized for his comments on the subject.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

===Georgia-LSU===
The game between LSU and Georgia, on October 3, 2009, was the beginning of this controversy.  In this game, [[AJ Green]], one of the players for the Georgia Bulldogs, was penalized for “excessive celebration” &lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; after a sixteen-yard catch in the end zone, giving Georgia a touchdown.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[[#Reference-idPaschall2009|Paschall, David.  "SEC suspends football officiating crew."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This gave Georgia a 13-12 lead with just over a minute left in the game.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; This penalty forced Georgia to kick off from its own fifteen-yard line, which helped LSU to win the game.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  The final score was 20-13.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Southeastern Conference did admit the mistakes in this call, however.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

===Florida-Mississippi State===
Florida played at Mississippi State on October 24, 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  With 8:25 left in the game, Florida’s Dustin Doe intercepted a pass by Mississippi State’s Tyson Lee and then returned it for twenty-three yards, giving Florida a 28-13 lead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[[#Reference-idTaylor2009|Taylor, John.  "Another day, another SEC 'controversy'."]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Doe crossed the goal line into the end zone for the touchdown, the ball was knocked out of his hand and recovered by wide receiver Brandon McRae.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  After review, it remained a touchdown for Florida, although from the replay, it appeared as if the ball “may have come out before Doe crossed the goal line”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  If the replay officials had decided that the ball did come out before he crossed the goal line, then Florida’s touchdown could have been taken away and Mississippi State would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard-line with the score at 22-13, with Florida in the lead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
After the game, Mississippi State’s head coach, [[Dan Mullen]], complained about this officiating, stating that he hoped that the official would be punished severely.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The Southeastern Conference replied by pointing out Rule 12-1-2 in the NCAA football rule book:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
"The instant replay process operates under the fundamental assumption that the ruling on the field is correct.  The replay official may reverse a ruling if and only if the video evidence convinces him beyond all doubt that the ruling was incorrect.  Without such indisputable video evidence, the replay official must allow the ruling to stand.
The SEC refused to make any further comment on the call."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  They gave Coach Mullen a public reprimand and did not acknowledge the possible error in officiating.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

==Effects==

===Suspension of officials===
Following the Arkansas-Florida game, the Southeastern Conference suspended the crew of referees that worked the LSU-Georgia game and the Arkansas-Florida game.  Michael Slive commented on the fact that the calls were not to the standard that officiating crews for the SEC are expected to have &lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  This was the first time that the SEC has suspended a crew publicly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; According to Michael Slive, “because the two calls we had to deal with came from the same crew we felt it was important to do something we don’t normally do, which is to talk publicly about the situations."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;   These referees were suspended until November 14, 2009.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Harsher penalties for publicly criticizing SEC officials===
After three Southeastern Conference coaches publicly criticized officiating and were reprimanded, the conference decided to fine or suspend coaches for future violations of the rule against public criticism of officiating, and Michael Slive will set the fines and determine the suspension length.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStiffer2009|"Stiffer penalties for critics. (Sports Desk)(SPORTS BRIEFING COLLEGE FOOTBALL)(Brief article)."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the comment is made by the head coach or by an assistant coach or other personnel involved in the institution’s athletic program, the head coach will receive the penalty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[[#Reference-idBylaw2009|"Bylaw 10.5.4 Penalties Strengthened."]]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to make the penalty for violations of this bylaw more severe was unanimous among the SEC’s Athletic Directors, and it had the full support of the twelve Presidents and Chancellors in the SEC.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
Although the penalties for violating bylaw 10.5.4 are harsher than in the past, the coaches will still have appropriate methods of addressing concerns of officiating; the conference will “continue to address reviews of officiating calls on specific plays with each institution’s head coach and no public comments will be made concerning these communications”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Conspiracy theory==
As a result of all the controversial officiating and the public reprimands for the criticisms made by the coaches who may or may not have been the victims of bad officiating, many people came to the conclusion that the Southeastern Conference was trying to help Florida and Alabama win their games.  Lane Kiffin intensified this conspiracy theory when he stated that he let the clock run down instead of making another play because he was afraid that the officiating would work against him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  He claimed that he was sure that he would get a letter of reprimand after saying these things, while Florida and Alabama continued their winning streaks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;
After these statements, however, Michael Slive argued,  “there is no conspiracy involved here.  I want to put that idea to rest”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;   He refuted the claim that SEC officiating crews were trying to help Alabama and Florida remain undefeated, adding that, “I think that takes these issues to a place that really doesn’t make sense”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;[[#Reference-idSlive2009|"Slive downplays SEC officiating issues."]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He pointed out that his job is to try to do what was best for the conference, and that that is what he is trying to do.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; 
The Southeastern Conference’s coordinator of officials stated that he did not believe that the officiating in the 2009 season was any worse than in other seasons, but that several incidents received a lot more attention because they were more high profile.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   David Parry, the national coordinator of College Football Officiating, argued that the SEC has some of the best officials and that the officiating is very good; it’s just that the mistakes that have been pointed out this year have greatly affected the game, so these are more memorable mistakes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;  Slive agreed with the idea that the officiating is no worse than usual when he asserted that he has not received more complaints from SEC coaches this year, but he believes that the comments this season were sharper.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;  
Slive also pointed out that the officials are human and will make mistakes, but that the league will evaluate the officiating program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;  He, along with Rogers Redding, who is the coordinator of officials, and others, are going to meet after the season to talk about the officiating mistakes and make sure the officiating is the best it can be.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; He firmly believes that the Southeastern Conference officials are honest, diligent, and loyal, and that they want the best for the league.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

The '''2016 CECAFA Cup''' was to be the 39th edition of the annual [[CECAFA Cup]], an international football competition consisting of the national teams of member nations of the [[Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations]] (CECAFA).
In September 2016, it was confirmed that Kenya would host the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37310529|title=Kenya step in to host Cecafa events|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was to be hosted in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35232983|title=Sudan named as 2016 Cecafa Cup hosts|work=BBC Sport|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Kenya announced they are not ready to host the tournament and CECAFA officials are looking to persuade Sudan to take over as hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2016-11-05/205055/|title=CECAFA looking for Cup hosts after Kenya withdrawals|work=New Times Rwanda|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, CECAFA announced the 2016 edition of the tournament will be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38265595|title=Cecafa 2016 tournaments cancelled|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aerial reconnaissance''' is [[reconnaissance]] for a [[military]] or [[Strategy|strategic]] purpose that is conducted using [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of [[imagery intelligence]], observation of enemy maneuvers and [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]].

==History==

===Early developments===
After the [[French Revolution]], the new rulers became interested in using the [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] to observe enemy manoeuvres and appointed scientist [[Jean-Marie-Joseph Coutelle|Charles Coutelle]] to conduct studies using the balloon ''L'Entreprenant'', the first military reconnaissance aircraft. The balloon found its first use in the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|1794 conflict with Austria]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} where in the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] they gathered information. Moreover, the presence of the balloon had a demoralizing effect on the Austrian troops which improved the likelihood of victory for the French troops.

After the invention of photography, primitive aerial photographs were made of the ground from manned and unmanned balloons, starting in the 1860s, and from tethered kites from the 1880s onwards.&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web |author=Nicholas M.

In the early 20th century, [[Julius Neubronner]] experimented with [[pigeon photography]].
The pigeons carried small cameras with timers.&lt;ref name="FASO"&gt;{{cite web |author=Nicholas M. Short, Sr. |title=Remote Sensing Tutorial Overview |url=https://fas.org/irp/imint/docs/rst/Front/overview.html |accessdate=2009-03-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226041129/https://fas.org/irp/imint/docs/rst/Front/overview.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} (photographs by Alfred Nobel's rocket and the Bavarian pigeon fleet)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Aerial Photography |url=http://northstargallery.com/aerialphotography/History%20Aerial%20Photography/history.htm |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Rahrmann in 1891 patented a means of attaching a camera to a large calibre artillery projectile or rocket, and this inspired [[Alfred Maul]] to develop his [[Maul Camera Rocket]]s starting in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id="wikide"&gt;Editors of German Wikipedia. [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Maul&amp;oldid=46822183] Retrieved 2009-03-13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1896 had already built the first rocket carrying a camera, which took photographs of the Swedish landscape during its flights.&lt;ref name="FAS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-01-08 |title=Cameras in Model Rockets: A Short History |url=http://rocketry.wordpress.com/2007/01/08/cameras-in-model-rockets-a-short-history/ |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maul improved his camera rockets and the Austrian Army even tested them in the [[Balkan Wars|Turkish-Bulgarian War]] in 1912 and 1913, but by then and from that time on camera-carrying aircraft were found to be superior.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Wade |title=Maul Camera Rocket |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/mauocket.htm |accessdate=2009-03-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307215811/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/mauocket.htm |archivedate=7 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (summary and photo)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of airplanes in combat missions was by the [[Italian Air Force]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911-1912. On 23 October 1911, an Italian pilot, Capt. Carlo Piazza, flew over the Turkish lines in [[Libya]] to conduct history's first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on 1 November 1911, the first ever aerial bomb was dropped on the Turkish troops in Libya.

The first reconnaissance flight in Europe took place in Greece, over Thessaly, on October the 5th over the Ottoman army. This was the first day of the Balkan wars, and during the same day a similar mission was flown by German mercenaries in Ottoman service in the Thrace front against the Bulgarians. The Greek and the Ottoman mission flown during the same day are the first military aviation combat missions in a conventional war. A few days later, on 16 October 1912 a [[Bulgaria]]n Albatros aircraft performed one of Europe's first reconnaissance flight in combat conditions,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} against the Turkish lines on the [[Balkan peninsula]], during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-1913.

===Maturation during World War I===
{{main article|Aerial reconnaissance in World War I}}
[[File:RFC aircraft with aerial reconnaissance camera.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2c]] reconnaissance aircraft of the [[Royal Flying Corps|RFC]] with an aerial reconnaissance camera fixed to the side of the fuselage, 1916.]]
The use of aerial photography rapidly matured during the [[First World War]], as aircraft used for reconnaissance purposes were outfitted with cameras to record enemy movements and defences. At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air.

[[Frederick Charles Victor Laws]] started experiments in aerial photography in 1912 with  [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]] using  the British dirigible  [[British Army airship Beta|''Beta'']]. He discovered that vertical photos taken with 60% overlap could be used to create a [[stereoscopic]] effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The dirigibles were eventually allocated to the [[Royal Navy]], so Laws formed the first aerial reconnaissance unit of fixed-wing aircraft; this became [[No. 3 Squadron RAF]].

Germany was one of the first countries to adopt the use of a camera for aerial reconnaissance, opting for a [[Goerz (company)|Görz]], in 1913. French Military Aviation began the war with several squadrons of [[Blériot Aéronautique|Bleriot]] observation planes, equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time.

[[File:Rumpler Taube monoplane.jpg|thumb|left|A German observation plane, the [[Rumpler Taube]].]]
The [[Royal Flying Corps]] recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915 the entire system of German trenches was being photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northstargallery.com/aerialphotography/history%20aerial%20photography/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Aerial Photography}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain [[John Moore-Brabazon]] in 1915 with the help of the [[Thornton-Pickard]] company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals.

Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/royal-flying-corps-founded|title=Royal Flying Corps Founded|publisher=History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J06OFiCSBroC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=How It Works: Science and Technology|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2003|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making.

By the end of the war, aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and [[optical power|focal power]] and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict.

In January 1918, [[General Allenby]] used five Australian pilots from [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron AFC]] to photograph a {{convert|624|sqmi|km2}} area in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front. This was a pioneering use of aerial photography as an aid for [[cartography]]. Lieutenants [[Leonard Taplin]], [[Allan Brown (aviator)|Allan Runciman Brown]], H. L. Fraser, [[Edward Patrick Kenny]], and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines {{convert|32|mi|km}} deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using [[Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12]] and [[Martinsyde]] airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also bucked 65 mile-per-hour winds, anti-aircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task circa 19 January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southsearepublic.org/2002_1999/afc_aces_taplin.htm#top |title=Lieutenant Leonard T.E.

===World War II===

====High-speed reconnaissance aircraft====
[[File:Lockheed 12A G-AGTL Ringway 14.04.58 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Sidney Cotton]]'s [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior|Lockheed 12A]], in which he made a high-speed reconnaissance flight in 1940.]]
In 1928, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/edgerton/www/pre-hee.html#aerial|title=Photography Before Edgerton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 [[Sidney Cotton]] and [[Flying Officer]] [[Maurice Longbottom (RAF officer)|Maurice Longbottom]] of the RAF suggested that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast, small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception. Although this may perhaps seem obvious today with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Cotton and Longbottom proposed the use of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s with their armament and [[radio]]s removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras. This led to the development of the '''[[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin-powered variants)#Early reconnaissance (PR) variants|Spitfire PR]]''' variants. These planes had a maximum speed of 396&amp;nbsp;mph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spies in the Sky |first=Taylor |last=Downing |isbn=978-1-4087-0280-2 |year=2011 |publisher=Little Brown Hardbacks (A &amp; C) |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 30,000&amp;nbsp;feet with their armaments removed, and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions. The aircraft were fitted with five cameras which were heated to ensure good results (while the cockpit was not). Spitfires proved to be extremely successful in their reconnaissance role and many Spitfire variants were built specifically for that purpose. They served initially with what later became [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotton, Sidney|title=Aviator Extraordinary: The Sidney Cotton Story|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1969|page=169|ISBN=978-0-7011-1334-6|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Aviator_extraordinary.html?id=TUHbAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were also adapted for photo-reconnaissance, including the British [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] and the American [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]. Such craft were painted in [[Air Force blue#Air superiority blue.2FPRU blue|PRU Blue]] or Pink camouflage colours to make them difficult to spot in the air, and often were stripped of weapons or had engines modified for better performance at high [[altitude]]s (over 40,000 feet).

The American '''F-4''', a factory modification of the '''[[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]''', replaced the nose-mounted four [[M2 Browning|machine gun]]s and cannon with four high-quality K-17 cameras. Approximately 120 F-4 and F-4As were hurriedly made available by March 1942, reaching the 8th Photographic Squadron in Australia by April (the first P-38s to see action). The F-4 had an early advantage of long range and high speed combined with ability to fly at high [[altitude]]; a potent combination for reconnaissance. In the last half of 1942 Lockheed would produce 96 F-5As, based on the P-38G with all later P-38 photo-reconnaissance variants designated '''F-5'''. In its reconnaissance role the Lightning was so effective that over 1,200 F-4 and F-5 variants were delivered by Lockheed, and it was the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]'s primary photo-reconnaissance type used throughout the war in all combat theatres. The '''[[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang F-6]]''' arrived later in [[World War II|the war]] and by spring 1945 became the dominant reconnaissance type flown by the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] in [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]]. [[United States|American]] photo-reconnaissance operations in Europe were based at [[RAF Mount Farm]], with the resulting photographs transferred to Medmenham for interpretation. Approximately 15,000 [[Fairchild K-20]] aerial cameras were manufactured for use in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reconnaissance aircraft between 1941 and 1945.

The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s '''[[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]''' excelled in the photo-reconnaissance role; the converted bomber was fitted with three cameras installed in what had been the bomb bay. It had a cruising speed of 255 mph, maximum speed of 362 mph and a maximum altitude of 35,000 feet. The first converted PRU (Photo-Reconnaissance Unit) Mosquito was delivered to [[RAF Benson]] in July 1941 by [[Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.|Geoffrey de Havilland]] himself. The '''[[de Havilland Mosquito#Photo-reconnaissance|PR Mk XVI]]''' and later variants had [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] [[cockpit]]s and also pressurized central and inner wing tanks to reduce fuel vaporization at high [[altitude]]. The Mosquito was faster than most [[Axis powers|enemy]] fighters above 40,000 ft,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and could roam almost anywhere. Colonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote; "I consider the Mosquito the best photo reconnaissance aircraft of the war".&lt;ref name="V Weapons Hunt, p35" &gt;[[#Colonel Roy M. Stanley II, V Weapons Hunt|V Weapons Hunt]] p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] designation for the photo-reconnaissance Mosquito was '''F-8'''.

Apart from (for example) the Mosquito, most World War II [[bomber]]s were not as fast as [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, although they were effective for aerial reconnaissance due to their long range, inherent stability in flight and capacity to carry large camera payloads. American bombers with top speeds of less than 300 mph used for reconnaissance include the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] (photo-reconnaissance variant designated '''F-7'''), [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] ('''F-10''') and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] ('''F-9'''). The revolutionary '''[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]]''' was the world's largest combat-operational bomber when it appeared in 1944, with a top speed of over 350 mph which at that time was outstanding for such a large and heavy aircraft; the B-29 also had a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cabin]] for high altitude flight. The photographic reconnaissance version of the B-29 was designated '''F-13''' and carried a camera suite of three K-17B, two K-22 and one K-18 with provisions for others; it also retained the standard B-29 defensive armament of a dozen [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber machine gun]]s. An F-13 conducted the [[1 November 1944 reconnaissance sortie over Japan|first flight by an Allied aircraft over Tokyo]] since the [[Doolittle Raid]] of April 1942.

The Japanese [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|Army]] '''[[Mitsubishi Ki-46]]''', a twin-engined aircraft designed expressly for the reconnaissance role with defensive armament of 1 light machine gun, entered service in 1941. [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Codename]]d "Dinah" this aircraft was fast, elusive and proved difficult for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighters to destroy. More than 1,500 Ki-46s were built and its performance was upgraded later in the war with the Ki-46-III variant. Another purpose-designed reconnaissance aircraft for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] was the [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] single engine '''[[Nakajima C6N]]''' ''Saiun'' ("Iridescent Cloud"). [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Codename]]d "Myrt" by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the Nakajima C6N first flew in 1943 and was also highly elusive to American aircraft due to its excellent performance and speed of almost 400 mph. As fate would have it on 15 August 1945, a C6N1 was the last aircraft to be shot down in [[World War II]]. Japan also developed the high-altitude '''[[Tachikawa Ki-74]]''' reconnaissance bomber, which was in a similar class of performance as the [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], but only 16 were built and did not see operational service.

The [[Luftwaffe]] began deploying [[jet aircraft]] in combat in 1944, and the twin-[[Jet engine|jet]] '''[[Arado Ar 234]]''' ''Blitz'' ("Lightning") reconnaissance bomber was the world's first operational jet-powered bomber. The '''Ar 234B-1''' was equipped with two Rb 50/30 or Rb 75/30 cameras, and its top speed of 460 mph allowed it to outrun the fastest non-jet Allied fighters of the time. The twin [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-engined '''[[Junkers Ju 388]]''' high-altitude bomber was an ultimate evolution of the [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]] by way of the [[Junkers Ju 188|Ju 188]]. The photographic reconnaissance '''Ju 388L''' variant had a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] [[cockpit]] from the Ju 388's original multi-role conception as not only a bomber but also a night fighter and [[Heavy fighter|bomber destroyer]], due to [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]]'s perceived threat of the [[United States|U.S.]]'s high-altitude [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] (which ended up not being deployed in [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]]). Approximately 50 Ju 388Ls were produced under rapidly deteriorating conditions at the end of the war. As with other high performance weapons introduced by [[Nazi Germany]], too many circumstances in the war's logistics had changed by late 1944 for such aircraft to have any impact.

The '''[[DFS 228]]''' was a [[Rocket engine|rocket]]-powered high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft under development in the latter part of [[World War II]]. It was designed by [[Felix Kracht]] at the [[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug]] (German Institute for Sailplane Flight) and in concept is an interesting precursor to the post-war [[United States|American]] [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], being essentially a powered long-[[wingspan]] [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] intended solely for the high-altitude aerial reconnaissance role. Advanced features of the DFS 228 design included a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] escape capsule for the pilot. The aircraft never flew under rocket power with only unpowered glider [[prototype]]s flown prior to May 1945.

[[File:Danesfield house 2005.jpg|300px|thumb|[[RAF Medmenham]], where aerial reconnaissance intelligence was analysed.]]
The collection and interpretation of aerial reconnaissance intelligence became a considerable enterprise during the war. Beginning in 1941, [[RAF Medmenham]] was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the [[European theatre of World War II|European]] and [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spies in the Sky |first=Taylor |last=Downing |isbn=978-1-4087-0280-2 |year=2011 |publisher=Little Brown Hardbacks (A &amp; C) |pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buckscc"&gt;[https://ubp.buckscc.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid='TBC563' Unlocking Buckinghamshire's Past]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Central Interpretation Unit]]'' (CIU) was later amalgamated with the Bomber Command Damage Assessment Section and the Night Photographic Interpretation Section of No 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, [[RAF Oakington]], in 1942.&lt;ref name="rcahms"&gt;[http://aerial.rcahms.gov.uk/isadg/isadg.php?refNo=GB_551_NCAP/17 Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU)]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312151307/http://aerial.rcahms.gov.uk/isadg/isadg.php?refNo=GB_551_NCAP%2F17 |date=March 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1942 and 1943, the CIU gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war, and in every aspect of intelligence. In 1945, daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints. Thirty-six million prints were made during the war. By [[VE-day]], the print library, which documented and stored worldwide cover, held 5,000,000 prints from which 40,000 reports had been produced.&lt;ref name=rcahms/&gt;

American personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the CIU and on 1 May 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the ''Allied Central Interpretation Unit'' (ACIU).&lt;ref name=rcahms/&gt; There were then over 1,700 personnel on the unit's strength. A large number of photographic interpreters were recruited from the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood Film Studios]] including [[Xavier Atencio]]. Two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters: [[Dorothy Garrod]], the first woman to hold an Oxbridge Chair, and [[Glyn Daniel]], who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show ''[[Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?]]''.&lt;ref name=Crossbow/&gt;

[[Sidney Cotton]]'s aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron, he pioneered the technique of high-altitude, high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At its peak, British reconnaissance flights yielded 50,000 images per day to interpret.

Of particular significance in the success of the work of Medmenham was the use of [[stereoscopic]] images, using a between plate overlap of exactly 60%. Despite initial scepticism about the possibility of German rocket development, stereoscopic analysis proved its existence and major operations, including the 1943 offensives against the [[V-2 rocket]] development plant at [[Peenemünde Army Research Center|Peenemünde]], where made possible by work carried out at Medmenham. Later offensives were also made against potential launch sites at [[Wizernes]] and 96 other launch sites in northern France.

Particularly important sites were measured, from the images, using Swiss [[stereoautograph]] machines made by [[Wild Heerbrugg|Wild (Heerbrugg)]] and physical models made to facilitate understanding of what was there or what it was for.

It is claimed that Medmanham's greatest operational success was [[Operation Crossbow]] which, from 23 December 1943, destroyed the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] infrastructure in northern France.&lt;ref name="Crossbow"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011cr8f "Operation Crossbow", BBC2, broadcast 15 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reginald Victor Jones|R.V. Jones]], photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2 rocket]].

===Cold War===
[[File:Photo interpretation.jpg|thumb|[[Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation|Photo interpretation]] at the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency#National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC)|National Photographic Interpretation Center]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].]]
Immediately after World War II long range aerial reconnaissance was taken up by adapted [[Jet aircraft|jet]] [[bomber]]s, such as the [[English Electric Canberra]] and its American development the [[Martin RB-57D Canberra|Martin B-57]], capable of flying higher or faster than enemy [[Interceptor aircraft|aircraft]] or [[Anti-aircraft warfare|defense]]s. After the [[Korean War]] the [[United States]] used [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|RB-47]] aircraft which at first were converted B-47 jet bombers, but later purposely built as RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft that carried no bombs. Large cameras were mounted in the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|plane]]'s belly and a truncated [[bomb bay]] used for carrying [[photoflash bomb]]s.  Later versions of the RB-47 such as the RB-47H were extensively modified for [[signals intelligence]] (ELINT), with additional equipment operator crew stations in the bomb bay; unarmed [[weather reconnaissance]] WB-47s with cameras and meteorological instruments also served the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] during the 1960s.

[[File:U-2 photo during Cuban Missile Crisis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] truck convoy deploying missiles near [[San Cristóbal, Cuba]] on 14 October 1962 (photograph taken by a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]].)]]
The onset of the [[Cold War]] led to development of highly specialized and clandestine strategic [[reconnaissance aircraft]], or spy planes, such as the [[Lockheed U-2]] and its successor the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] (both from the [[United States]]). Flying these aircraft became an exceptionally demanding task, with [[Aircrew#Military|crew]]s specially selected and trained due the aircraft's extreme performance characteristics in addition to risk of being captured as [[espionage|spies]]. The [[1960 U-2 incident|American U-2 shot down]] in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[airspace]] and capture of [[Francis Gary Powers|its pilot]] caused political turmoil at the height of the Cold War.  
[[File:RA-5C RVAH-6 in flight 1970.jpg|thumb|right|[[North American A-5 Vigilante|RA-5C Vigilante]] carrier-based supersonic reconnaissance aircraft of the U.S. Navy.]]
Beginning in the early 1960s, United States aerial and [[Reconnaissance satellite|satellite reconnaissance]] was coordinated by the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO). Risks such as loss or capture of reconnaissance aircraft [[Aircrew#Military|crewmember]]s also contributed to [[United States|U.S.]] development of the [[Ryan Model 147]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|RPV]] (Remotely Piloted Vehicle) unmanned drone aircraft which were partly funded by the [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA525674 |title=Air Force UAVs:  The Secret History|author=Ehrhard, Thomas P. |date=July 2010 |website=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC®) |publisher=Mitchell Institute for Airpower Studies |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1960s.

The [[United States Navy]] converted its [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] bomber, the [[North American A-5 Vigilante]], into the highly capable RA-5C Vigilante reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s. Beginning in the early 1980s the U.S. Navy outfitted and deployed [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]] aircraft in one squadron aboard an [[aircraft carrier]] with a system called [[Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System|TARPS]] which provided naval aerial reconnaissance capability until the Tomcat's 2006 retirement.

The United States has embarked on a [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] project called the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72|SR-72]] to replace the Blackbird.

===Miniature UAVs===
Due to the low cost of miniature UAVs, this technology brings aerial reconnaissance into the hands of soldiers on the ground. The soldier on the ground can both control the UAV and see its output, yielding great benefit over a disconnected approach. With small systems being man packable, operators are now able to deploy air assets quickly and directly. The low cost and ease of operation of these miniature UAVs has enabled forces such as the Libyan Rebels to use miniature UAVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeryon Scout Micro UAV Helps Libyan Rebels in March to Tripoli|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/271-libyanrebels.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Scorel - Maria Magdalena (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam version) - 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Magdalene]] is traditionally depicted with a vessel of ointment, in reference to the Anointing of Jesus.]]
{{Gospel Jesus|expanded=Passion}}
The anointing of Jesus’s feet are events recorded in the [[four gospels]]. The account in Matthew 26, Mark 14, and John 12 has as its location the city of [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] in the south and involves [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]] the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The event in Luke features an unknown sinful woman, and is in the northern region, as Luke 7 indicates Jesus was ministering in the northern regions of [[Nain (Biblical village)|Nain]] and [[Capernaum]]. The honorific anointing with perfume is an action frequently mentioned in other literature from the time; however, using long hair to dry Jesus's feet, as in John and Luke, is not recorded elsewhere, and should be regarded as an exceptional gesture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hornsby, 339-342&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable debate has discussed the identity of the woman, the location, timing, and the message.

== Description ==

:The anointing of Jesus’s feet are two events recorded in the [[four gospels]]. The honorific anointing with perfume is an action frequently mentioned in other literature from the time; however, using long hair to dry Jesus's feet, as in John and Luke, is not recorded elsewhere, and should be regarded as an exceptional gesture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mary of Bethany ===

:The account in Matthew 26, Mark 14, and John 12 has as its location the city of [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] in the south. In John's gospel the woman is named as [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]] the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Criticism surrounding the action is directed at Mary for using an expensive ointment which could have been sold and the proceeds given to the poor. In the Matthew/Mark/John accounts, Jesus links the anointing with a preparation for His burial as he would be crucified not many days hence.

=== The sinful woman ===

:The woman in John is Mary the sister of Martha and Lazarus. In Mark and Matthew she is unnamed. The event in Luke features an unknown sinful woman. It takes place in the northern region, as Luke 7 indicates Jesus was ministering in the northern regions of [[Nain (Biblical village)|Nain]] and [[Capernaum]]. The woman uses her tears, as well as perfume. Criticism in this account is directed at Jesus for allowing a sinner to touch him. In Luke, Jesus connects the action with the woman’s sins, his forgiveness, and the lack of hospitality of his host.

=== Conflation ===

:As with many events in the Gospels, ambiguous or missing details between the author's accounts lead to different interpretations by readers and scholars. The accounts are generally considered to be independent events, though often been conflated—a result being the assumption that Mary is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. This is furthered by the presence of a number of [[New Testament people named Mary|women named Mary in the New Testament]], leading to Mary of Bethany being interpreted as [[Mary Magdalene]].
:The rationale behind two events stems from the details in each account. All four have a setting in a house for a meal, a woman, and expensive perfume poured on Jesus to which someone objects. However, the geographic location is not identified as Bethany in Luke's account. The home in Matthew and Mark is of [[Simon the Leper]], while in Luke it is a house of a [[Pharisee]] named Simon. John identifies [[Mary of Bethany]] and Luke "a woman in that town who lived a sinful life"—which has usually been taken to mean a prostitute—while Matthew and Mark just say "a woman". The place of anointment also differs, with Mark and Matthew stating that it was over the head, with John and Luke recording an anointing of feet and wiping with hair.
:The morale of the stories are similar in Matthew, Mark, and John are very similar, recording slightly different wordings of "The poor you will always have with you" and "She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial". These are not in Luke, who instead records comments on hospitality and forgiveness of sins that are not in the other accounts.&lt;ref&gt;See for all points Hornsby, 339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel accounts==
The event (or events – see discussion below) is reported in [[Matthew 26]], [[Mark 14]], [[Luke 7]], and [[John 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textexcavation.com/synanointingjesus.html |title=The anointing of Jesus |date=2009-04-21 |publisher=TextExcavation.com |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208000804/http://www.textexcavation.com/synanointingjesus.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew and Mark are very similar:

[[File:Mary Magdalen anointing Christ’s feet (f. 15v) Cropped.jpg|thumb|Mary Magdalen anointing Christ’s feet. Illuminated manuscript, c. 1500]]
;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:6–13}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, 7 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked. 9 "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."  Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 11 The poor you will always have with you,&lt;ref&gt;Deut. 15:11: There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land,&lt;/ref&gt; but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.  Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;{{bibleverse||Mark|14:3–9}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.  Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?  It could have been sold for more than a year's wages&lt;ref&gt;Greek: ''three hundred denarii''&lt;/ref&gt; and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly. "Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.  The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. 8 She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:36–50}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.   When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner."  Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."  "Tell me, teacher," he said.  "Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,&lt;ref name=denarius&gt;A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day laborer.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"  Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven."  "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.  Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.  You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.  Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."  Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."   The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"  Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;{{bibleverse||John|12:1–8}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.  Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.  But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages."  He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.  "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The anointing of Jesus is a subject of considerable debate.

Some&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Burton L. &amp; Vernon K. Robbins, ''Patterns of Persuasion in the Gospels'' (2008), pp. 85-106 {{ISBN|1-60608-220-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold that the anointing is actually two separate events, one occurring at the beginning of Jesus' ministry (in which he offered forgiveness to a repentant woman) and the other in which he is anointed in preparation for his burial. Luke's gospel speaks of Jesus' feet being anointed by a woman who had been sinful all her life and who was crying; and when her tears started landing on the feet of Jesus, she wiped his feet with her hair. Also unique to Luke's version is the inclusion of the [[Parable of the Two Debtors]] in the middle of the event.  An argument can be made that this story could not have occurred only a few days before the crucifixion, due to the numerous events that followed in Luke's gospel. John 12:1-8&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|12:1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; names her Mary, and the text assumes her to be [[Mary, sister of Lazarus|Mary, a sister to Lazarus]], as it also identifies her sister Martha. The iconography of the woman's act has traditionally been associated with [[Mary Magdalene]], but there is no biblical text identifying her as such (she is mentioned by name for the first time, immediately following this episode, at the beginning of Luke chapter 8). According to the [[Gospel of Mark]] 14:3, the perfume in his account was the purest of [[Spikenard]].

Another debate is over the implications of "the poor you always have with you"; some{{Who|date=February 2012}} criticized this response as lax morality, others{{Who|date=February 2012}} have responded that, due to his impending crucifixion, Jesus is simply explaining that what was done was not a choice between two moral acts, but a necessity, and would no more be criticized in Jesus' day as a modern man purchasing a coffin for a loved one, even though there are poor that could be fed instead. In the autobiographical ''[[Palm Sunday (book)|Palm Sunday]]'', author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] reports being invited to preach on [[Palm Sunday]] in 1980, and chooses for his [[Chapters and verses of the Bible#Verses|text]] the [[Gospel of John]]'s version of the anointing.  Vonnegut did so because he had "seen so much un-Christian impatience with the poor encouraged by the quotation"; he questioned the translation, saying that it lacked the mercifulness of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and took the opportunity to offer his own translation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Palm Sunday| isbn= 0-440-57163-4 |first=Kurt | last= Vonnegut | authorlink= Kurt Vonnegut |year=1981 | publisher= Dell| pages= 324–330 |quote=
Whatever it was that Jesus really said to Judas was said in Aramaic, of course-and has come to us through Hebrew and Greek and Latin and archaic English. Maybe He only said something a lot like, "The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me." Perhaps a little something has been lost in translation....I would like to recapture what has been lost. Why? Because I, as a Christ-worshipping agnostic, have seen so much un-Christian impatience with the poor encouraged by the quotation "For the poor always ye have with you."...If Jesus did in fact say that, it is a divine black joke, well suited to the occasion. It says everything about hypocrisy and nothing about the poor. It is a Christian joke, which allows Jesus to remain civil to Judas, but to chide him for his hypocrisy all the same. 'Judas, don't worry about it. There will still be plenty of poor people left long after I'm gone.'....My own translation does no violence to the words in the Bible. I have changed their order some, not merely to make them into the joke the situation calls for but to harmonize them, too, with the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. The Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade.

[[File:Bouts anoiting.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Christ in the House of Simon'' by [[Dieric Bouts]]]]

Mark and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] say that this occurred while Jesus was in [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] relaxing at the home of [[Simon the Leper]], a man whose significance is not explained any further by surviving texts of Mark or Matthew. Some assume that the accounts in the four gospels are speaking of the same event and would identify the host as Simon the [[Pharisee]], as mentioned in Luke's account. However, this identification to come under considerable debate given the nearness in time to Jesus' crucifixion, and the fact that Simon the host is called a leper elsewhere. Luke's gospel states that Jesus had been invited to dinner, though the location is not specified. The Gospel of John identifies the location of the anointing prior to the crucifixion as Bethany, the city where Lazarus and his two sisters lived, but does not specify the precise location. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] follows the Synoptic Gospels in the location of the event. John and Luke also differ from Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. This, some argue, points to the idea that Luke is speaking of an entirely different event.

The ''Scholars Version'' note to Mark 14:3–9 states: "The disciples miss the point, which Jesus makes clear: the woman has signaled his impending death and burial. It must be unintentional irony when Mark has Jesus predict that this story will always be ''told in memory'' of a woman whose very name escapes him."

The '''Battle of Bagrevand''' was fought on 25 April 775, in the plains of [[Bagrevand]], between the forces of the [[Medieval Armenia|Armenian]] princes who had rebelled against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the caliphal army. The battle resulted in a crushing Abbasid victory, with the death of the main Armenian leaders. The [[Mamikonian]] family's power in particular was almost extinguished. The battle signalled the beginning of large-scale Armenian migration into the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Adalian|2010|p=xxxv}}

==Background and the battle==
Following the establishment of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Caliph [[al-Mansur]] (reigned 754–775) abolished the subsidies paid to the various [[Armenians|Armenian]] princes (''[[nakharar]]'') and in addition imposed heavy tax duties on them. Coupled with instances of religious persecution against the majority Christian Armenian population, these measures prompted the outbreak of a major anti-Abbasid revolt in 774.{{sfn|Whittow|1996|p=213}}{{sfn|Dadoyan|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=21–22}} The revolt was led by [[Artavazd Mamikonian]], but gathered the direct or tacit support of most ''nakharar'' families, most notably the hitherto pro-Arab [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]], while the [[Artsruni]] and [[Siwni]] families remained neutral. The rebellion spread through Armenia, including attacks against Arab tax-collectors, and the local Arab governor, [[al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba]], was unable to contain it. The Caliph sent 30,000 [[Khurasan]]is under Amir ibn Isma'il into the province, and at the Battle of Bagrevand on 25 April 775, the ''nakharar'' suffered a decisive defeat, losing their leaders, [[Smbat VII Bagratuni]] and [[Mushegh VI Mamikonian]]. After the battle, the revolt was brutally suppressed by the Abbasids.{{sfn|Whittow|1996|p=213}}{{sfn|Dadoyan|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=21–22}}

==Aftermath==
As the historian [[Mark Whittow]] writes, the battle was a "watershed in [[Transcaucasia]]n politics". The defeat of the Armenian revolt eliminated the power of several of the ''nakharar'' houses, most notably the [[Mamikonian]], [[Gnuni]], [[Amatuni]], [[Rshtuni]], [[Saharuni]] and [[Kamsarakan]] families, which survived "either as dependants of other families, or as exiles in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]" (Whittow).{{sfn|Whittow|1996|p=213}}{{sfn|Dadoyan|2011|p=85}} On the other hand, the Artsruni, who switched over to the Caliphate in time, profited from the power vacuum to rise to power in [[Vaspurakan]], while the Bagratuni, after retreating for a while to their mountain strongholds, managed to reclaim a [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia|dominant position]] in the country during the 9th century.{{sfn|Whittow|1996|pp=213–215}}

The Abbasids followed their re-imposition of control over Armenia by a similar purge of the native Christian nobility in neighbouring [[Principate of Iberia|Iberia]] in the 780s, as well as by a new settlement policy which saw increasing numbers of Arab Muslims settled in the Transcaucasus, with the effect that by the turn of the 9th century, the Arab element predominated in the towns and lowlands. In the next century, [[Caucasian Albania]] was effectively Islamicized, while Iberia and much of Armenia came under the control of a series of Arab emirates.{{sfn|Whittow|1996|p=213}}{{sfn|Ter-Ghewondyan|1976|pp=29ff.}}

'''"Casey Jones—the Union Scab"''' is a song, written by labor figure [[Joe Hill]] in [[San Pedro, California]], shortly after the first day of a nationwide walkout of 40,000 railway employees in the [[Illinois Central shopmen's strike of 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Gibbs M.|title=Joe Hill|date=2009|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFwsHQVuHVUC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[parody]] of the song "[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]" and is sung to its tune.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (commonly known as the Wobblies) are an [[industrial unionism|industrial union]]. Many of the railway workers were organized into the railway brotherhoods, which were [[craft unionism|craft unions]].

The song was published in the ''[[Little Red Songbook]]'' in 1912.&lt;ref name="Gibbs Smith Book"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gibbs M.|last=Smith|title=Joe Hill|page=26|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chaambi Operations''' or ''' Battle of Chaambi''' is part of the [[insurgency in the Maghreb (2002–present)]]. In December 2012, the [[Tunisian Army]] launched an offensive against the [[Salafist]] jihadists in [[Jebel ech Chambi]] near [[Kasserine]].

On June 6, a Tunisian vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Doghra in Jebel Chambi: Two soldiers were killed and two others wounded. According to the Tunisian government, jihadists belonging to militias Okba ibn Nafaâ, an al-Qaida cell in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al-Sharia. The latter group, led by Seifallah Ben Hassine, known as "Abu Iyadh" however say they have no connection with the clashes delivered Jebel Chambi.

On 18 July, in the wilaya of [[El Oued]], the Algerian army intercepted a pickup truck loaded with weapons from Libya to Jebel Chambi; two of its occupants were killed.

July 29, around 6 pm, a group of Tunisian soldiers were ambushed in [[Sabaa Diar]], in Jebel Chambi. Their truck was strafed by some thirty rebels Salafists, several soldiers being disarmed and executed. Eight soldiers were killed and three others injured, one fatally, several bodies being slaughtered. According to Mohamed Ali Aroui, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Gadhgadhi Kamel, suspected of being the murderer of Chokri Belaid man, took part in the slaughters. The same day at Talla an army vehicle hit a mine, wounding three men.

On the evening of August 1, the Tunisian army launched an offensive on the Djebel Chambi with ground forces and air force, saying combat katiba Okba Ibn Nafaâ.

'''Cheung Chau Bun Festival''' ({{zh|t=包山節}}) or '''Cheung Chau Da Jiu Festival''' ({{zh|t=長洲太平清醮}}) is a traditional [[China|Chinese]] [[festival]] on the island of [[Cheung Chau]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Held annually, and with therefore the most public exposure, it is by far the most famous of such [[Da Jiu festivals]], with ''Jiu'' (醮) being a [[Taoist]] sacrificial ceremony.
Such events are held by mostly rural communities in Hong Kong, either annually or at a set interval of years ranging all the way up to once every 60 years (i.e. the same year in the [[Chinese astrology#Luni-solar calendar|Chinese astrological calendar]]).  Other places that may share the folk custom include [[Taiwan]], [[Sichuan]], [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:Bun festival old.jpg|thumb|right|The old-style "Bun Mountain" made up of bamboo poles]]
[[Image:Bun festival Flying colors parade Cheung Chau.jpg|right|thumb|Dancers in the Flying Colors Parade.]]
Cheung Chau's Bun Festival, which draws tens of thousands of local and overseas tourists every year, is staged to mark the Eighth day of the Fourth Month, in the [[Chinese calendar]] (this is usually in early May). It coincides with the local celebration of [[Buddha's Birthday]].

The Cheung Chau Bun Festival began as a fun and exciting ritual for fishing communities to pray for safety from pirates. Today this religious origin has largely been forgotten, and the festival has mainly a become a showcase of traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]].

Kwok Kam Kee, the official [[bun]] supplier for the festival which was opened 40 years ago, makes over 60,000 buns for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/26/smallbusiness/hong-kong-bun-scramble/index.html?iid=SF_LN|title=Why one Hong Kong bakery makes 10,000 buns a day|first=Sophia|last=Yan|website=''[[CNN Money]]''|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Cheung Chau Bun Festival 1961.jpg|right|thumb|Cheung Chau Bun Festival in 1961.]]
One story of the origin of the festival is that in the 18th century, the island of [[Cheung Chau]] was devastated by a [[pandemic|plague]] and infiltrated by [[pirates]] until local fishermen brought an image of the god [[Pak Tai]] to the island. Paraded through the village lanes, the deity drove away evil spirits. Villagers also disguised themselves as different deities and walked around the island to drive away the evil spirits.

==Activities==
===Vegetarian===
[[Image:Bun festival veg.jpg|thumb|A notice announces that McDonald's is selling [[Veggie burger|McVeggie]]]]
Every year on the 8th day of the fourth month of the [[lunar calendar]], the islanders organise a weeklong thanksgiving, the Cheung Chau Bun Festival usually in April or May. The festival lasts for seven days. On three of these days the entire island goes [[vegetarian]]; most of the island's famous seafood restaurants adhere to this tradition. The local [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]] also takes meat off the menu and instead sells [[veggie burger]]s made of [[mushroom]]s.

===Parade of floats===
In addition to traditional [[lion dance]]s and [[dragon dance]]s, children dressed as legendary and modern heroes are suspended above the crowd on the tips of swords and paper fans (飄色). They form the parade-in-the-air and are all secured within steel frames, though they appear to glide through the air. Parents consider it a great honour for their offspring to be part of the parade.

This fascinating procession is accompanied by the bedlam of musicians loudly beating gongs and drums to scare away evil spirits. It is led by a spectacular image of [[Pak Tai]], the God of Water and Spirit of the North, to whom the island's [[Yuk Hui Temple|Temple of the Jade Vacuity]] is dedicated.

===Deities===
Here are some divinities [[Cheung Chau]] people celebrate in the festival:

====Pak Tai====
Since Cheung Chau is traditionally an island of fisherfolk, [[Pak Tai]] is its most revered divinity, since it is believed he has the power to confer smooth sailing for the fishing boats as well as providing good catches for their crews. Pious believers recognise him as "Pei Fang Chen Wu Hsuan T'ien Shang Ti" (True Soldier and Superior Divinity of the Deep Heaven of the North).

====Tin Hau (Lin Mo Niang) ====
The second of the significant deities involved in the pageant is the much-revered [[Matsu (goddess)|Tin Hau]], Goddess of the Seas and protector of all fishermen and boat people. Celebrated for providing warnings of imminent storms and saving countless lives from wreckage, she is in many ways Pak Tai's competitor for the fondness of the fisherfolk.

====Kuan Yin and Hung Hsing====
Two more gods complete the celestial divinities taking part in the parade: [[Kuan Yin]], the Goddess of Mercy with her tranquil and ever compassionate smile; and [[Hung Hsing]], the terrifying God of the South with his menacing head-dress, unkind face, bushy black beard, and stave at the ready to chastise all enemies.

=== Bun snatching ===
[[File:Bun Scrambling 1961.jpg|right|thumb|Bun snatching in 1961.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bun festival bun.jpg|frame|Steamed buns for the "Bun Mountain", being stamped the crimson characters of the respective district (北社, "Northern Society" shown in a combined way) on the island.]] --&gt;

The centrepiece of the festival is at [[Yuk Hui Temple|Pak Tai Temple]] where the "Bun Mountains" or "Bun Towers"(包山) stand. These are three giant 60-feet [[bamboo]] [[tower]]s covered with [[Chinese bakery|bun]]s. It is these bun-covered towers that give the festival its name. It originates from the custom in [[Southern Fujian]] and [[Chaozhou]] known as ''qianggu'' ({{Lang-zh|t=搶孤|poj=chhiúⁿ-ko·}})， where people snatch food that has been offered to the lonely spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.hkcd.com/content/2016-04/21/content_996886.html |title= 長洲飄色搶包山的傳統意義 |publisher= Hong Kong Commercial Daily |date=2016-04-21|accessdate=2018-06-12|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, young men would race up the tower to get hold of the buns; the higher the bun, the better fortune it was supposed to bring to the holder's family; the race was known as "Bun-snatching" (搶包山).&lt;ref name="TVB"&gt;[[TVB]] show 1st quarter of 2008: 賞識人間道, exclusive on the bun race.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during a race in 1978 one of the towers collapsed, injuring more than 100 people. In subsequent years, three designated climbers (one climber to each tower) raced up their respective towers and having cleared the top buns proceeded to strip the towers of their buns as they descended.

The three "Bun Mountains" are still placed in the area in front of Pak Tai Temple, and are constructed using the traditional fixation method — [[bamboo scaffolding]].

In 2005, a single tower climbing event in the adjacent sports ground was revived as a race—with extra safety precautions including proper mountain-climbing tools as well as tutorials for participants (which now include women). A teamwork version of the event was added in 2006.The revised version of "Bun-snatching" as well as the traditional three "Bun Mountains" still have their buns removed from the towers at midnight of the Festival.

In February 2007, it was further announced that the buns on the single-tower construct will henceforth be made of plastic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200702/16/P200702160249.htm HK government: Bun Festival upholding both tradition and safety]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the festival, [[Chinese opera]]s, [[lion dance]]s, and religious services also take place on the island.

===Burning of paper effigies===
At a quarter to midnight a paper effigy of the [[King of the Ghosts]] is set ablaze, enormous [[incense]] sticks are lit and the buns are harvested and distributed to the villagers, who, pleased to be sharing in this propitious good fortune, rejoice late into the night.

==Return of bun-snatching==
[[File:Steelbaoshan Cheung Chau.jpg|thumb|The new "Bun Mountain" used for bun-snatching competitions]] As mentioned above, the bun-snatching ritual was abandoned by government decree due to the 1978 collapse of a tower. Still, many Cheung Chau villagers regard this celebration as part and parcel of their life, and  also as an example of the precious [[culture of Hong Kong]]. In addition to the villagers' immense urge to resume the ritual, a local cartoon movie ''[[My life as McDull]]'' recalled the abandoned ceremony, giving rise to nostalgia in its viewers. Because of its great popularity, the long-awaited ritual was reintroduced on 15 May 2005. Safety measures were intensified: only 12 well-trained athletes selected from preliminary competitions were permitted to climb on one single "Bun Mountain", and instead of bamboo, the framework of the "Bun Mountains" was made of [[steel]].

===More about ''My life as McDull'' and bun-snatching===
''[[My life as McDull]]'' was a sizable hit in Christmas 2001. This Hong Kong animated feature was primarily targeted at children. Aside from the cute character designs, however, ''My Life as McDull'' had also shown many renowned qualities of [[Hong Kong]] people—hard-working, carefree, and never giving up. The "Hong Kong dream" depicted in the film charmed much of its audience. The animation is aided by computer-generated backgrounds, but it retains a delightful hand-drawn look that is pleasing to movie-goers. In a part of the film, [[McDull]] decides to train to be an Olympic-level athlete like the Hong Kong Olympian [[Lee Lai-shan]]. However, the trade he learns is Cheung Chau bun-snatching. Realising that bun-snatching is not a formal sporting event in the [[Olympic games]], McDull’s mother writes a letter to the chairman of the [[International Olympic Committee]] ([[IOC]]), asking him/her with her limited proficiency of English to sanctify the so-called sport event.

The '''Corning Opera House''' is a theater located in [[Corning, Iowa]], United States. This was the third of three opera houses built in town.  The other two were built in the 1880s, and this one was completed in 1902. It was the only opera house in Corning by 1907, and it served as a theater until 1934.  From its opening in 1902 until 1921 it staged theatrical performances, and from about 1920 to 1931 it showed movies. It also staged [[vaudeville]] performances and high school productions.&lt;ref name=Cunning&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=93000954}}|title=Corning Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-02-09|author1=Tracy A.

It featured raked seating on the main floor and in the horseshoe-shaped balcony, and it had a small stage and specialized rooms backstage.&lt;ref name=Cunning/&gt; Commercial space is located on the main floor of the building.

Since 1934 the second-floor opera house had been used for storage by the local newspaper. The western part of the building, the lobby and restroom area, was converted into apartments in 1943. The main floor in the opera house was leveled and marked for half-court basketball at some point.  The building was individually listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; In 2012 it was included as a [[contributing property]] in the [[Corning Commercial Historic District]].&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/75338209|title=Corning Commercial Historic District|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2017-11-27|author=James E.

A multi-year $3.5 million renovation was completed in 2012.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corningoperahouse.com/our-history.html|title=Our History...|publisher=Corning Opera House|accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the opera house was restored to a performance venue. A grand opening was held April 5 and 6, 2012.

The '''counterculture of the 1960s''' was an [[anti-establishment]] cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the [[Western world]] between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] continued to grow, and would later become revolutionary with the expansion of the U.S. government's extensive [[Vietnam War|military intervention in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Donald Hirsch|Hirsch, E. D.]] (1993). ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-65597-9}}. p. 419. "Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. in the 1960s and affected Europe before fading in the 1970s&amp;nbsp; ... fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson| first = Terry H.| title = The Movement and the Sixties| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1995| isbn = 978-0-19-510457-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Judson R.|title=Current Perspectives on Social Problems|date=1973|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Co.|location=Belmont, California|isbn=978-0-534-00289-3|page=2|edition=Third|quote=Culture is the "social heritage" of society. It includes the complex set of learned and shared beliefs, customs, skills, habits, traditions, and knowledge common to the members of society. Within a culture, there may be subcultures made up of specific groups that are somewhat separate from the rest of society because of distinct traits, beliefs, or interests.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding [[human sexuality]], [[Second-wave feminism|women's rights]], traditional modes of authority, experimentation with [[psychoactive drug]]s, and differing interpretations of the [[American Dream]]. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/POLSC301-9.1.3-Counterculture.pdf|title=Counterculture|last=|first=|date=|website=saylor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the era unfolded, new cultural forms and a dynamic [[Zeitgeist|subculture]] which celebrated experimentation, modern incarnations of [[Bohemianism]], and the rise of the [[hippie]] and other alternative lifestyles, emerged. This embracing of creativity is particularly notable in the works of [[British Invasion]] bands such as [[The Beatles]], and filmmakers whose works became far less restricted by censorship. In addition to the trendsetting Beatles, many other creative artists, authors, and thinkers, within and across many disciplines, helped define the counterculture movement.

Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian movements]] of previous eras. The post-World War II "[[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]]"&lt;ref name="CNN 2011-08-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2011/08/11/pf/recession_birth_rate/chart-birth-rate-2.top.gif |format=GIF |title=Birth Rate Chart |work=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=August 11, 2011 |quote=Annotated Chart of 20th Century US Birth Rates }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomerslife.org/baby_boom_population_us_census_bureau_by_state.htm |title=Baby Boom population - U.S. Census Bureau - USA and by state |publisher=Boomerslife.org |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated an unprecedented number of potentially disaffected young people as prospective participants in a rethinking of the direction of American and other democratic societies.&lt;ref name="Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Student Protest in the 1960s |journal=Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute: Curriculum Unit 79.02.03 |year=1979 |last=Churney |first=Linda |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1979/2/79.02.03.x.html |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote=This unit focuses on student protest in the 60s }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war affluence allowed many of the counterculture generation to move beyond a focus on the provision of the material necessities of life that had preoccupied their [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] parents.&lt;ref name="KidnerBucur2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Kidner|author2=Maria Bucur|author3=Ralph Mathisen|author4=Sally McKee |author5=Theodore Weeks|title=Making Europe: People, Politics, and Culture, Volume II: Since 1550|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIMSNu5OFHoC&amp;pg=PA831|date=December 27, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-00481-2|pages=831–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era was also notable in that a significant portion of the array of behaviors and "causes" within the larger movement were quickly assimilated within mainstream society, particularly in the US, even though counterculture participants numbered in the clear minority within their respective national populations.&lt;ref name="RubinCasper2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Joan Shelley Rubin|author2=Professor Scott E.

The counterculture era essentially commenced in earnest with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in November 1963. It became absorbed into the [[popular culture]] with the termination of US combat military involvement in Southeast Asia and the end of the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] in 1973, and ultimately with the [[Watergate scandal#Resignation|resignation]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1974.

===Social issues and calls to action===

Many social issues fueled the growth of the larger counterculture movement. One was a nonviolent movement in the United States seeking to resolve constitutional civil rights illegalities, especially regarding general [[racial segregation]], longstanding [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] of blacks in the South by white-dominated state government, and ongoing racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and access to public places in both the North and the South.

Many counterculture activists became aware of the plight of the poor, and [[community organizer]]s fought for the funding of [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s, particularly in the South and within [[ghetto|inner city]] areas in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/tcn/valocchi.htm |title=The Historical Development of Community Organizing |publisher=Trincoll.edu |accessdate=July 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821210336/http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/tcn/valocchi.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lillian|title=Our Faces, Our Words|date=1964|publisher=Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=9780393002515|page=114|edition=First (pbk)|quote=But there is something beyond rights, something not more important but more desperately urgent: bodily need.

[[Environmentalism]] grew from a greater understanding of the ongoing damage caused by [[industrialization]], resultant [[pollution]], and the misguided use of chemicals such as [[pesticides]] in well-meaning efforts to improve the quality of life for the rapidly growing population.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/worldgrgraph.php |title=International Data Base World Population Growth Rates: 1950–2050 |publisher=US Department of Commerce |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote=The world population growth rate rose from about 1.5 percent per year from 1950 to 1951, to a peak of over 2 percent in the early 1960s due to reductions in mortality. Growth rates thereafter started to decline due to rising age at marriage as well as increasing availability and use of effective contraceptive methods. Note that changes in population growth have not always been steady. A dip in the growth rate from 1959 to 1960, for instance, was due to the Great Leap Forward in China. During that time, both natural disasters and decreased agricultural output in the wake of massive social reorganization caused China's death rate to rise sharply and its fertility rate to fall by almost half |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220064433/http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/worldgrgraph.php |archive-date=February 20, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Rachel Carson]] played key roles in developing a new awareness among the [[world population|global population]] of the [[Ecology|fragility of our planet]], despite resistance from elements of the establishment in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muir|first1=Patricia|title=History of Pesticide Use|url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~muirp/pesthist.htm|website=oregonstate.edu|publisher=Oregon State College|accessdate=July 7, 2014|quote=Then, things began to temper the enthusiasm for pesticides.

In retrospect, this book really launched the environmental movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to address minority rights of women, gay people, the handicapped, and many other neglected constituencies within the larger population came to the forefront as an increasing number of primarily younger people broke free from the constraints of 1950s orthodoxy and struggled to create a more inclusive and tolerant social landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Skrentny, John (2002).

The availability of new and more effective forms of [[birth control]] was a key underpinning of the [[sexual revolution]]. The notion of "recreational sex" without the threat of unwanted pregnancy radically changed the social dynamic and permitted both women and men much greater freedom in the selection of sexual lifestyles outside the confines of traditional marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/ |title=American Experience &amp;#124; The Pill |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this change in attitude, by the 1990s the ratio of children born out of wedlock rose from 5% to 25% for Whites and from 25% to 66% for African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/99-09.pdf |title=Determinants of Planned and Unplanned Childbearing among Unmarried Women in the United States |last1=Musick |first1=Kelly |date=April 1999 |website=wisconsin.edu |publisher=Center for Demography and Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====

For those born after [[World War II]], the emergence of television as a source of entertainment and information—as well as the associated massive expansion of [[consumerism]] afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV [[advertising]]—were key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as [[ad agencies]] heavily courted the "hip" youth market.&lt;ref name="Frank1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Frank|title=The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHyIY2cctQIC&amp;pg=PA132|date=December 1, 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-26012-9|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonHerr2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary L.

====New cinema====
The breakdown of enforcement of the US [[Hays Code]]&lt;ref name="National Public Radio (US)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93301189 |title=Remembering Hollywood's Hays Code, 40 Years On |last=Mondello |first=Bob |publisher=npr.org |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote= ...

The end of censorship resulted in a complete reformation of the western film industry. With new-found artistic freedom, a generation of exceptionally talented [[New Hollywood|New Wave]] film makers working across all genres brought realistic depictions of previously prohibited subject matter to neighborhood theater screens for the first time, even as [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios were still considered a part of the establishment by some elements of the counterculture.

====New radio====
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|A family watches television, {{circa|1958}}]]
By the later 1960s, previously under-regarded [[FM radio]] replaced [[AM radio]] as the focal point for the ongoing explosion of [[rock and roll]] music, and became the nexus of youth-oriented news and advertising for the counterculture generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Christopher &amp; Keith, Michael (2008).

UNC Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-3215-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal Communications Commission (US)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/omd/history/radio/quality.html |title=The Quality that Made Radio Popular |publisher=US FCC |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote=It was not until the 1960s ... that the quality advantage of FM combined with stereo was enjoyed by most Americans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing lifestyles===

[[Commune]]s, [[collective]]s, and [[intentional communities]] regained popularity during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Power|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57h.asp|website=ushistory.org|publisher=ushistory.org/Independence Hall Association|accessdate=July 28, 2014|date=2014|quote=Like the utopian societies of the 1840s, over 2000 rural communes formed during these turbulent times. Completely rejecting the capitalist system, many communes rotated duties, made their own laws, and elected their own leaders. Some were philosophically based, but others were influenced by new religions. Earth-centered religions, astrological beliefs, and Eastern faiths proliferated across American campuses. Some scholars labeled this trend as the Third Great Awakening.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early communities, such as the [[Hog Farm]], [[Quarry Hill Creative Center|Quarry Hill]], and [[Drop City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616390/One-Americas-hippies-dies-94-founding-infamous-retreat.html |title=One of America's first 'hippies' dies at 94 after founding famous Vermont retreat

in the US were established as straightforward [[back to the land movement|agrarian]] attempts to return to the land and live free of interference from outside influences. As the era progressed, many people established and populated new communities in response to not only disillusionment with standard community forms, but also dissatisfaction with certain elements of the counterculture itself. Some of these self-sustaining communities have been credited with the birth and propagation of the international [[Green Politics|Green Movement]].

The emergence of an interest in expanded spiritual consciousness, [[yoga]], [[occult]] practices and increased [[Human Potential Movement|human potential]] helped to shift views on organized religion during the era. In 1957, 69% of US residents polled by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] said religion was increasing in influence. By the late 1960s, polls indicated less than 20% still held that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103459/Questions-Answers-About-Americans-Religion.aspx# |title=Questions and Answers About Americans' Religion |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Generation Gap]]", or the inevitable perceived divide in worldview between the old and young, was perhaps never greater than during the counterculture era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/1960s/videos/ask-steve-generation-gap#ask-steve-hippie-vs-yippie |title=Ask Steve: Generation Gap (Video)|website=history.com |publisher=History Channel/A&amp;E|quote=Explore the existence of the generation gap that took place in the 1960s through this Ask Steve video. Steve Gillon explains there was even a larger gap between the Baby Boomers themselves than the Baby Boomers and the Greatest Generation. The massive Baby Boomers Generation was born between 1946 and 1964, consisting of nearly 78 million people. The Baby Boomers were coming of age in the 1960s, and held different cultural values than the Greatest Generation. The Greatest Generation lived in a time of self-denial, while the Baby Boomers were always seeking immediate gratification. However, the Baby Boomers were more divided amongst themselves. Not all of them were considered hippies and protesters. In fact, people under the age of 28 supported the Vietnam War in greater numbers than their parents. These divisions continue to play out today. |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large measure of the generational chasm of the 1960s and early 1970s was born of rapidly evolving fashion and hairstyle trends that were readily adopted by the young, but often misunderstood and ridiculed by the old. These included the wearing of very long hair by men,&lt;ref name="Macan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Macan|title=Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b98dJ3cYAksC&amp;pg=PT127|date=November 11, 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988009-6|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wearing of natural or "[[Afro]]" hairstyles by black people, the donning of revealing clothing by women in public, and the mainstreaming of the psychedelic clothing and regalia of the short-lived hippie culture. Ultimately, practical and comfortable casual apparel, namely updated forms of [[T-shirts]] (often [[tie-dyed]], or emblazoned with political or advertising statements), and [[Levi's|Levi Strauss-branded]] blue denim jeans&lt;ref name="CunninghamLab1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Anne Cunningham|author2=Susan Voso Lab|title=Dress and Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoXKtfx4weoC&amp;pg=PA31|year=1991|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-507-5|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the enduring uniform of the generation. The fashion dominance of the counterculture effectively ended with the rise of the [[Disco]] and [[Punk Rock]] eras in the later 1970s, even as the global popularity of T-shirts, denim jeans, and casual clothing in general have continued to grow.

====Emergent middle-class drug culture====
In the western world, the ongoing criminal legal status of the recreational drug industry was instrumental in the formation of an anti-establishment social dynamic by some of those coming of age during the counterculture era. The explosion of [[marijuana]] use during the era, in large part by students on fast-expanding college campuses,&lt;ref name="The Nation 1966-01-31"&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Mervin B. |last2=Powelson |first2=Harvey |url=http://thenation.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/drugsoncampus1966.pdf |title=Drugs on Campus: Turned On &amp; Tuned Out |work=The Nation |location=New York |publisher=Nation Co.

The [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States|classification of marijuana as a narcotic]], and the attachment of severe criminal penalties for its use, drove the act of smoking marijuana, and experimentation with substances in general, deep underground.

===Law enforcement===
[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|upright|thumb|Anti-war protesters]]
The confrontations between college students (and other activists) and law enforcement officials became one of the hallmarks of the era. Many younger people began to show deep distrust of police, and terms such as "[[List of police-related slang terms|fuzz]]" and "pig" as derogatory [[epithets]] for police reappeared, and became key words within the counterculture lexicon. The distrust of police was based not only on fear of [[police brutality]] during political protests, but also on generalized police corruption - especially police manufacture of false evidence, and outright entrapment, in drug cases. In the US, the social tension between elements of the counterculture and law enforcement reached the breaking point in many notable cases, including: the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/timeline |title=1968:Columbia in Crisis |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University Libraries |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html |title=Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion

The Vietnam War, and the protracted national divide between supporters and opponents of the war, were arguably the most important factors contributing to the rise of the larger counterculture movement.

The widely accepted assertion that anti-war opinion was held only among the young is a myth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seanet.com/~jimxc/Politics/Mistakes/Vietnam_support.html |title=Support for Vietnam War |publisher=Seanet.com |date=November 21, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/commentary/?analysisid=57 |title=Generations Divide Over Military Action in Iraq - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=October 17, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enormous war protests consisting of thousands of mostly younger people in every major US city, and elsewhere across the Western world, effectively united millions against the war, and against the war policy that prevailed under five US congresses and during two presidential administrations.

===In Western Europe===
The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with London, Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Copenhagen and West Berlin rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers.[[File:Londons Carnaby Street, 1966.jpg|thumb|left| Carnaby Street, London, 1966]]

The [[UK Underground]] was a movement linked to the growing subculture in the US and associated with the hippie phenomenon, generating its own magazines and newspapers, fashion, music groups, and clubs. Underground figure [[Barry Miles]] said, "The underground was a catch-all sobriquet for a community of like-minded anti-establishment, anti-war, pro-rock'n'roll individuals, most of whom had a common interest in recreational drugs. They saw peace, exploring a widened area of consciousness, love and sexual experimentation as more worthy of their attention than entering the rat race. The straight, consumerist lifestyle was not to their liking, but they did not object to others living it. But at that time the middle classes still felt they had the right to impose their values on everyone else, which resulted in conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=Spirit of the underground: the 60s rebel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/30/underground-arts-60s-rebel-counterculture|website=theguardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] was a counterculture movement that focused on "provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait."&lt;ref name="Tusman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Tusman|title=Really Free Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA159|publisher=PediaPress|pages=159–|id=GGKEY:UWBUGNHU1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kommune 1]] or K1 was a commune in West Germany, and was known for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between [[satire]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]. These events served as inspiration for the "[[Revolutionary spontaneity|Sponti]]" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstraße in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music and drugs. Soon, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, including [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;''Keith Richards: The Biography'', by Victor Bockris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berke1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph H.

===In Eastern Europe===

''[[Mánička]]'' is a [[Czech language|Czech]] term used for young people with long hair, usually males, in [[Czechoslovakia]] through the 1960s and 1970s. Long hair for males during this time was considered an expression of political and social attitudes in [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|communist Czechoslovakia]]. From the mid-1960s, the long-haired and "untidy" persons (so called ''máničky'' or ''vlasatci'' (in English: [[wikt:Mops|Mops]]) were banned from entering pubs, cinema halls, theatres and using public transportation in several Czech cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"&gt;[[#Pokorná|Pokorná (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the public transportation regulations in [[Most (Most District)|Most]] and [[Litvínov]] excluded long-haired ''máničky'' as displeasure-evoking persons. Two years later, the municipal council in [[Poděbrady]] banned ''máničky'' from entering cultural institutions in the town.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; In August 1966, ''[[Rudé právo]]'' informed that ''máničky'' in [[Prague]] were banned from visiting restaurants of the I. and II. price category.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

In 1966, during a big campaign coordinated by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], around 4,000 young males were forced to cut their hair, often in the cells with the assistance of the state police.&lt;ref name="radioprague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/127919|title=Háro a Vraťe nám vlasy!|last=Faltýnek|first=Vilém|date=2010-05-16|website=[[Czech Radio|Radio Praha]]|language=Czech|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 1966, during a "safety intervention" organized by the state police, 140 long-haired people were arrested. As a response, the "community of long-haired" organized a protest in [[Prague]]. More than 100 people cheered slogans such as "Give us back our hair!" or "Away with hairdressers!". The state police arrested the organizers and several participants of the meeting. Some of them were given prison sentences.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; According to the newspaper ''[[Mladá fronta Dnes]]'', the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior in 1966 even compiled a detailed map of the frequency of occurrence of long-haired males in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct24.cz/domaci/97481-policejni-akce-vlasatci-kniha-vratte-nam-vlasy-prinasi-nove-dokumenty/|title=Policejní akce Vlasatci - kniha Vraťte nám vlasy přináší nové dokumenty|publisher=[[Česká televize]]|language=Czech|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1969, during the first anniversary of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the long-haired youth were one of the most active voices in the state protesting against the occupation.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; Youth protesters have been labeled as "vagabonds" and "slackers" by the official [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalized]] press.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

[[File:Oz-31-cover.jpg|thumb|''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' number 31 cover]]

''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine was first published as a satirical humour magazine between 1963 and 1969 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and, in its second and better known incarnation, became a "psychedelic hippy" magazine from 1967 to 1973 in [[London]]. Strongly identified as part of the [[underground press]], it was the subject of two celebrated [[obscenity]] trials, one in Australia in 1964 and the other in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=AnnMarie|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Alexandra|editor2-last=Leach|editor2-first=Andrew|title=Strategies of a Counter-Culture Oz Magazine and the Techniques of the Joke|journal=Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand Held on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia|date=July 2–5, 2013|volume=2|page=595–|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/536244/R03_04_Brennan_Strategies-of-a-Counterculture.pdf|accessdate=January 13, 2015|isbn=978-0-9876055-0-4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318033520/http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/536244/R03_04_Brennan_Strategies-of-a-Counterculture.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntyre2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain McIntyre|title=Tomorrow Is Today: Australia in the Psychedelic Era, 1966-1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGiu7Typ4iQC&amp;pg=PA51|date=January 1, 2006|publisher=Wakefield Press|isbn=978-1-86254-697-4|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, rock music was tied into the youth revolt of the 1960s. Mexico City, as well as northern cities such as [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Tijuana]], were exposed to US music. Many Mexican rock stars became involved in the counterculture. The three-day [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro]], held in 1971, was organized in the valley of Avándaro near the city of [[Toluca]], a town neighboring Mexico City, and became known as "The Mexican Woodstock". Nudity, drug use, and the presence of the US flag scandalized conservative Mexican society to such an extent that the government clamped down on rock and roll performances for the rest of the decade. The festival, marketed as proof of Mexico's modernization, was never expected to attract the masses it did, and the government had to evacuate stranded attendees en masse at the end. This occurred during the era of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Luis Echeverría]], an extremely repressive era in Mexican history. Anything that could be connected to the counterculture or student protests was prohibited from being broadcast on public airwaves, with the government fearing a repeat of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student protests]] of 1968. Few bands survived the prohibition; though the ones that did, like Three Souls in My Mind (now [[El Tri]]), remained popular due in part to their adoption of Spanish for their lyrics, but mostly as a result of a dedicated underground following. While Mexican rock groups were eventually able to perform publicly by the mid-1980s, the ban prohibiting tours of Mexico by foreign acts lasted until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-21514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cordobazo]] was a civil uprising in the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina]], in the end of May 1969, during the military dictatorship of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], which occurred a few days after the ''[[Rosariazo]]'', and a year after the French [[May '68]]. Contrary to previous protests, the Cordobazo did not correspond to previous struggles, headed by [[Marxist]] workers' leaders, but associated students and workers in the same struggle against the [[Military dictatorship|military government]].&lt;ref name=Bermand&gt;Carmen Bernand, « D'une rive à l'autre », ''Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Materiales de seminarios'', 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the [[EHESS]]), Put on line on June 15, 2008.

===Civil Rights Movement===
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}

The Civil Rights Movement, a key element of the larger counterculture movement, involved the use of applied [[nonviolence]] to assure that equal rights guaranteed under the [[US Constitution]] would apply to all citizens. Many states illegally denied many of these rights to African-Americans, and this was successfully addressed in the early and mid-1960s in several major nonviolent movements.&lt;ref name="HillBuckler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett D.

===Free Speech===
{{Main|Free Speech Movement}}

Much of the 1960s counterculture originated on college campuses. The 1964 Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, which had its roots in the Civil Rights Movement of the [[southern United States]], was one early example. At Berkeley a group of students began to identify themselves as having interests as a class that were at odds with the interests and practices of the University and its corporate sponsors. Other rebellious young people, who were not students, also contributed to the Free Speech Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsm-a.org/ |title=Free Speech Movement Archives Home Page - events from 1964 and beyond |publisher=FSM-A |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Left===
{{Main|New Left}}

The ''New Left'' is a term used in different countries to describe [[left-wing]] movements that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in the [[Western world]]. They differed from earlier leftist movements that had been more oriented towards [[labour movement|labour]] activism, and instead adopted [[social activism]]. The US "New Left" is associated with college campus mass protests and radical leftist movements. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "[[Old Left]]" parties in the post-World War II period. The movements began to wind down in the 1970s, when activists either committed themselves to party projects, developed [[social justice]] organizations, moved into [[identity politics]] or [[alternative lifestyles]], or became politically inactive.&lt;ref name="Marcuse2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Marcuse|title=The New Left and the 1960s: Collected Papers of Herbert Marcuse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML6GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=October 14, 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-77459-3|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almeida2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dimitri Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD7bKbo0FYEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=April 27, 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-34039-0|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchanan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Buchanan|title=Europe's Troubled Peace: 1945 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAHcBeZhm6UC&amp;pg=PA102|date=January 30, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-65578-8|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], was an influential [[libertarian socialist]] thinker on the radical student movements of the era&lt;ref&gt;"During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as "the guru of the New Left," publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism."

The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in America, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy].

By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement."

Opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] began in 1964 on United States college campuses. Student activism became a dominant theme among the baby boomers, growing to include many other demographic groups. Exemptions and deferments for the middle and upper classes resulted in the induction of a disproportionate number of poor, working-class, and minority registrants. Countercultural books such as [[MacBird]] by [[Barbara Garson]] and much of the counterculture music encouraged a spirit of non-conformism and anti-establishmentarianism. By 1968, the year after a large march [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|to the United Nations]] in [[New York City]] and a large protest at the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Pentagon]] were undertaken, a majority of people in the country opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Feminism===
{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}
The role of women as full-time homemakers in industrial society was challenged in 1963, when US feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', giving momentum to the women's movement and influencing what many called [[Second-wave feminism]]. Other activists, such as [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[Angela Davis]], either organized, influenced, or educated many of a younger generation of women to endorse and expand feminist thought. Feminism gained further currency within the protest movements of the late 1960s, as women in movements such as [[Students for a Democratic Society]] rebelled against the "support" role they had been consigned to within the male-dominated New Left, as well as against manifestations and statements of [[sexism]] within some radical groups. The 1970 pamphlet ''Women and Their Bodies'', soon expanded into the 1971 book ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'', was particularly influential in bringing about the new feminist consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/history/us-history-ii/the-new-frontier-and-the-great-society/the-counterculture-of-the-1960s|title=The Counterculture of the 1960s|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s counterculture embraced a [[Back-to-the-land movement|back-to-the-land]] ethic, and communes of the era often relocated to the country from cities. Influential books of the 1960s included [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' and [[Paul Ehrlich]]'s ''[[The Population Bomb]]''. Counterculture environmentalists were quick to grasp the implications of Ehrlich's writings on [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], the Hubbert "[[peak oil]]" prediction, and more general concerns over [[pollution]], [[litter]], the environmental effects of the Vietnam War, automobile-dependent lifestyles, and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. More broadly they saw that the dilemmas of energy and resource allocation would have implications for geo-politics, lifestyle, environment, and other dimensions of modern life. The "back to nature" theme was already prevalent in the counterculture by the time of the 1969 Woodstock festival, while the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970 was significant in bringing environmental concerns to the forefront of youth culture. At the start of the 1970s, counterculture-oriented publications like the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and ''[[The Mother Earth News]]'' were popular, out of which emerged a [[back to the land]] movement. The 1960s and early 1970s counterculture were early adopters of practices such as [[recycling]] and [[organic farming]] long before they became mainstream. The counterculture interest in [[ecology]] progressed well into the 1970s: particularly influential were New Left eco-anarchist [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Jerry Mander]]'s criticism of the effects of [[television]] on society, [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s novel ''[[Ecotopia]]'', [[Edward Abbey]]'s fiction and non-fiction writings, and [[E.F. Schumacher]]'s economics book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]''.

===Gay liberation===
{{Main|Gay liberation}}
[[File:Stonewall Inn 1969.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village, New York City, September 1969]]

The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], a gay bar in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. This is frequently cited as the first instance in US history when people in the gay community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and became the defining event that marked the start of the [[Gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.

==Culture and lifestyles==

===Hippies===
{{Further|History of the hippie movement}}

After the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]] in [[San Francisco]] organized by artist [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]], the media's attention on culture was fully activated.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Lee, Acid Dreams The CIA, LSD, and the Sixties Rebellion, [[Grove Press]] 1985, Pgs.&amp;nbsp;157–163 {{ISBN|978-0-394-62081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Scott McKenzie]]'s rendition of the song "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]" brought as many as 100,000 young people from all over the world to celebrate San Francisco's "[[Summer of Love]]." While the song had originally been written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] to promote the June 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], it became an instant hit worldwide (#4 in the United States, #1 in Europe) and quickly transcended its original purpose.

San Francisco's [[flower children]], also called "hippies" by local newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], adopted new styles of dress, experimented with [[psychedelic drug]]s, lived communally and developed a vibrant music scene. When people returned home from "The Summer of Love" these styles and behaviors spread quickly from San Francisco and Berkeley to many US and Canadian cities and European capitals. Some hippies formed communes to live as far outside of the established system as possible. This aspect of the counterculture rejected active political engagement with the mainstream and, following the dictate of Timothy Leary to "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]", hoped to change society by [[dropping out]] of it. Looking back on his own life (as a Harvard professor) prior to 1960, Leary interpreted it to have been that of "an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis&amp;nbsp; ... like several million [[middle-class]], liberal, intellectual robots."

As members of the hippie movement grew older and moderated their lives and their views, and especially after US involvement in the Vietnam War ended in the mid-1970s, the counterculture was largely absorbed by the mainstream, leaving a lasting impact on philosophy, morality, music, art, alternative health and diet, lifestyle and fashion.

In addition to a new style of clothing, philosophy, art, music and various views on anti-war, and anti-establishment, some hippies decided to turn away from modern society and re-settle on ranches, or communes. The very first of communes in the United States was a seven-acre land in Southern Colorado, named [[Drop City]]. According to Timothy Miller, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Drop City brought together most of the themes that had been developing in other recent communities-anarchy, pacifism, sexual freedom, rural isolation, interest in drugs, art-and wrapped them flamboyantly into a commune not quite like any that had gone before&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, M. (2010) Droppers: America's First Hippie Commune, Drop City. University of Oklahoma Press. p56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the inhabitants practiced acts like reusing trash and recycled materials to build Geodesic domes for shelter and other various purposes; using various drugs like marijuana and LSD, and creating various pieces of [[Drop Art]]. After the initial success of Drop City, visitors would take the idea of communes and spread them. Another commune called "The Ranch" was very similar to the culture of Drop City, as well as new concepts like giving children of the commune extensive freedoms known as "children's rights".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, B. (1981). The Survival of a Counterculture: Ideological work and everyday life among rural communards. University of California Press. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana, LSD, and other recreational drugs===
{{See also|History of LSD}}
{{Psychedelic sidebar|Culture}}
{{Cannabis sidebar|Arts and Culture}}

During the 1960s, this second group of casual [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) users evolved and expanded into a [[subculture]] that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising [[consciousness]]. The personalities associated with the subculture, gurus such as Timothy Leary and [[psychedelic rock]] musicians such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Pink Floyd]], Jimi Hendrix, [[The Byrds]], [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], [[Ultimate Spinach]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]], [[The Doors]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and the Beatles, soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.

The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as [[Ken Kesey]] participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of these early days of LSD's entrance into the non-academic world in his book ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', which documented the cross-country, acid-fueled voyage of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus "Furthur" and the Pranksters' later "Acid Test" LSD parties. In 1965, [[Sandoz]] laboratories stopped its still legal shipments of LSD to the United States for research and psychiatric use, after a request from the US government concerned about its use. By April 1966, LSD use had become so widespread that ''[[Time Magazine]]'' warned about its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899158,00.html |title=Drugs: The Dangers of LSD |publisher=TIME |date=April 22, 1966 |accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1966, the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Hallucination Generation]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|60488|Hallucination Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' in 1967 and ''[[Psych-Out]]'' in 1968.

====Psychedelic research and experimentation====
As most research on psychedelics began in the 1940s and 50s, heavy experimentation made its effect in the 1960s during this era of change and movement. Researchers were gaining acknowledgment and popularity with their promotion of psychedelia. This really anchored the change that counterculture instigators and followers began. Most research was conducted at top collegiate institutes, such as [[Harvard University]].

[[Timothy Leary]] and his Harvard research team had hopes for potential changes in society. Their research began with [[psilocybin]] mushrooms and was called the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. In one study known as the [[Concord Prison Experiment]], Leary investigated the potential for psilocybin to reduce [[recidivism]] in criminals being released from prison. After the research sessions, Leary did a follow-up. He found that "75% of the turned on prisoners who were released had stayed out of jail."&lt;ref name="Lattin"&gt;Lattin, Don. The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America. New York: HarperOne, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed he had solved the nation's crime problem. But with many officials skeptical, this breakthrough was not promoted.

Because of the personal experiences with these drugs Leary and his many outstanding colleagues, [[Aldous Huxley]] (''[[The Doors of Perception]]'') and [[Alan Watts]] (''The Joyous Cosmology'') believed that these were the mechanisms that could bring peace to not only the nation but the world. As their research continued the media followed them and published their work and documented their behavior, the trend of this counterculture drug experimentation began.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy. Flashbacks: An Autobiography. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary made attempts to bring more organized awareness to people interested in the study of psychedelics. He confronted the Senate committee in Washington and recommended for colleges to authorize the conduction of laboratory courses in psychedelics. He noted that these courses would "end the indiscriminate use of LSD and would be the most popular and productive courses ever offered".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Warren R., and Joseph R. Hixson. LSD on Campus. New York: [[Dell Pub.]], 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these men were seeking an ultimate enlightenment, reality eventually proved that the potential they thought was there could not be reached, at least in this time. The change they sought for the world had not been permitted by the political systems of all the nations these men pursued their research in. Ram Dass states, "Tim and I actually had a chart on the wall about how soon everyone would be enlightened ... We found out that real change is harder. We downplayed the fact that the psychedelic experience isn't for everyone."&lt;ref name="Lattin"/&gt;

Leary and his team's research got shut down at Harvard and everywhere they relocated around the globe. Their outlawish behavior and aggressive approach with these drugs did not settle well with the law. Officials did not agree with this chaotic promotion of peace.

Research with [[psychedelic drug]]s and those who conducted it was a radical understanding for the vast majority of the world. However, it did create a change. A ripple of curiosity was created as a result and the wave is continuing to swell.

====Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters====
Ken Kesey and his [[Merry Pranksters]] helped shape the developing character of the 1960s counterculture when they embarked on a cross-country voyage during the summer of 1964 in a psychedelic school bus named "Furthur". Beginning in 1959, Kesey had volunteered as a research subject for medical trials financed by the CIA's ''[[Project MKULTRA|MK ULTRA]]'' project. These trials tested the effects of LSD, psilocybin, [[mescaline]], and other psychedelic drugs. After the medical trials, Kesey continued experimenting on his own, and involved many close friends; collectively they became known as "The Merry Pranksters". The Pranksters visited Harvard LSD proponent Timothy Leary at his [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]], New York retreat, and experimentation with LSD and other psychedelic drugs, primarily as a means for internal reflection and personal growth, became a constant during the Prankster trip.

The Pranksters created a direct link between the 1950s [[Beat Generation]] and the 1960s psychedelic scene; the bus was driven by Beat icon [[Neal Cassady]], Beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] was on board for a time, and they dropped in on Cassady's friend, Beat author [[Jack Kerouac]] - though Kerouac declined to participate in the Prankster scene. After the Pranksters returned to California, they popularized the use of LSD at so-called "[[Acid Tests]]", which initially were held at Kesey's home in [[La Honda, California]], and then at many other West Coast venues. The cross country trip and Prankster experiments were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', a masterpiece of [[New Journalism]].

====Other psychedelics====
Experimentation with LSD, [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and other psychedelic drugs became a major component of 1960s counterculture, influencing philosophy, [[Psychedelic art|art]], music and styles of dress. Jim DeRogatis wrote that peyote, a small cactus containing the psychedelic alkaloid mescaline, was widely available in [[Austin, Texas]], a countercultural hub in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;J. DeRogatis, Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), {{ISBN|0-634-05548-8}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual revolution===
{{Main|Sexual revolution}}
The sexual revolution (also known as a time of "sexual liberation") was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[Western world]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;{{harvnb|Allyn|2000}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Escoffier|2003}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control|Contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], the normalization of [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]] and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative media===
{{Main|Alternative media}}

[[Underground newspapers]] sprang up in most cities and college towns, serving to define and communicate the range of phenomena that defined the counterculture: radical political opposition to "[[The Establishment]]", colorful experimental (and often explicitly drug-influenced) approaches to art, music and cinema, and uninhibited indulgence in sex and drugs as a symbol of freedom. The papers also often included comic strips, from which the [[underground comix]] were an outgrowth.

As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives.

===Avant-garde art and anti-art===
{{See also|Happening}}

The [[Situationist International]] was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in [[Marxism]] and the 20th-century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the ''construction of situations'', namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and [[advertising]] have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. [[Raoul Vaneigem]] wrote ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' which takes the field of "[[everyday life]]" as the ground upon which communication and participation can occur, or, as is more commonly the case, be perverted and abstracted into pseudo-forms.

[[Fluxus]] (a name taken from a [[Latin]] word meaning "to flow") is an international network of artists, composers and designers noted for blending different artistic media and disciplines in the 1960s. They have been active in [[Neo-Dada]] [[noise music]], [[visual art]], literature, [[urban planning]], architecture, and design. Fluxus is often described as [[intermedia]], a term coined by Fluxus artist [[Dick Higgins]] in a famous 1966 essay. Fluxus encouraged a "[[do-it-yourself]]" aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]] wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth."&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|978-0-948518-88-1}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; After, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] grew out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts. [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] (often referred to as simply "the Motherfuckers", or UAW/MF) was an [[anarchist]] [[affinity group]] based in [[New York City]].

During the early 1960s, [[British Invasion|Britain's new wave of musicians gained popularity and fame in the United States]]. Artists such as the Beatles paved the way for their compatriots to enter the US market.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shuker, 1998, p. 34{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles themselves were influenced by many artists, among them American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], who was a lyrical inspiration as well as their introduction to [[marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown and S. Gaines, 1984, p. 134{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's early career as a [[protest singer]] had been inspired by artists like [[Pete Seeger]]&lt;ref&gt;J.

J. Matusow, 1984, p. 295{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the 1960s moved towards an electric, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] version of rock, thanks largely to Bob Dylan's decision to play an electric guitar at the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32}}&lt;ref name="Sounes"&gt;H. Sounes, 2002, p. 218{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly popularized electric sound of rock was then built upon and molded into [[psychedelic rock]] by artists like [[The 13th Floor Elevators]]&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Strong, 1997, p. 276{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British bands [[Pink Floyd]] and the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 234{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beach Boys]]' 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' also paved the way for later [[hippie]] acts, with [[Brian Wilson]]'s writing interpreted as a "plea for love and understanding."&lt;ref&gt;J. Derogatis, 1996, p. 19{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pet Sounds'' served as a major source of inspiration for other contemporary acts, most notably directly inspiring the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. The single "[[Good Vibrations]]" soared to number one globally, completely changing the perception of what a record could be.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 37}} It was during this period that the highly anticipated album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' was to be released. However, the project collapsed and The Beach Boys released a downgraded version called ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', which failed to make a big commercial impact but was also highly influential, most notably on [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]].

The Beatles went on to become the most prominent commercial exponents of the "psychedelic revolution" (e.g., ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'') in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=1) Sgt.

These included [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] (''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]''), [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''), Jimi Hendrix (''[[Are You Experienced]]''), [[Jefferson Airplane]] (''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]''), [[The Doors]] (''[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]'') and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] (''[[Stand!]]''). Bands and other musicians, such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]] (Canada), [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[The Fugs]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|CSNY]], [[Shocking Blue]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], and [[The Holy Modal Rounders]] were considered key to the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;M.

While the hippie scene was born in [[California]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 41-42}}&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 72{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an edgier scene emerged in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;B. Longhurst, 1995, p. 108{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that put more emphasis on [[avant-garde]] and art music. Bands such as [[The Velvet Underground]] came out of this underground music scene, which was predominantly centered at [[Andy Warhol]]'s legendary [[The Factory|Factory]]. The Velvet Underground supplied the music for the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]], a series of [[multimedia]] events staged by Warhol and his collaborators in 1966 and 1967. The Velvet Underground's lyrics were considered risqué for the era, since they discussed [[sexual fetishism]], [[transgender]] identities, and the use of [[hard drugs]] associated with Warhol's Factory and its [[Warhol superstars|superstars]].&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 44{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fenklup.png|left|thumb|The [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] performs for the Dutch television show Fenklup in March 1967]]

Detroit's [[MC5]] also came out of the underground rock music scene of the late 1960s. They introduced a more aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with sociopolitical and countercultural lyrics of the era, such as in the song "Motor City Is Burning" (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit Race Riot]] of 1943 to the Detroit riot of 1967). MC5 had ties to radical leftist organizations such as "[[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]" and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]],&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;{{rp|117}} and MC5 performed a lengthy set before the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and the recent assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Snowman, 1978, p. 155{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MC5, [[The Stooges]] and the aforementioned Velvet Underground, are now seen as an influence on the [[protopunk]] sound that would lead to [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 237{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hotbed of the 1960s counterculture was [[Austin, Texas]], with two of the era's legendary music venues-the [[Vulcan Gas Company]] and the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]-and musical talent like [[Janis Joplin]], the [[13th Floor Elevators]], [[Shiva's Headband]], the Conqueroo, and, later, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Austin was also home to a large New Left activist movement, one of the earliest underground papers, [[The Rag]], and cutting edge graphic artists like [[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers|Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]] creator [[Gilbert Shelton]], underground comix pioneer [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]] (Jaxon), and surrealist armadillo artist [[Jim Franklin (artist)|Jim Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim DeRogatis]], ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), {{ISBN|0-634-05548-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s was also an era of [[rock festival]]s, which played an important role in spreading the counterculture across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mankin |first=Bill |url=http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ |title=We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America |work=Like the Dew: A Journal of Southern Culture and Politics |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which launched Hendrix's career in the US, was one of the first of these festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 95{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's 1968–1970 [[Isle of Wight Festival]]s drew big names such as [[The Who]], [[The Doors]], [[Joni Mitchell]], Hendrix, Dylan, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2002, p. 296{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in New York state became a symbol of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|title=3 Days of Peace and Music, 40 Years Later|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19love.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival drew a larger crowd.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;{{rp|58}} Some believe the era came to an abrupt end with the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]] held by [[The Rolling Stones]], in which heavy-handed security from the [[Hells Angels]] resulted in the stabbing of an audience member, apparently in self-defense, as the show descended into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 305{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Doors in Copenhagen 1968.jpg|thumb|[[The Doors]] performing for [[Television in Denmark|Danish television]] in 1968]]
As the psychedelic revolution progressed, lyrics grew more complex, (such as [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]"&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 297{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Long-playing albums enabled artists to make more in-depth statements than could be made in just a single song (such as the [[Mothers of Invention]]'s satirical ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1997, p. 317{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even the rules governing single songs were stretched, and singles lasting longer than three minutes emerged, such as Dylan's "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s "[[Alice's Restaurant]]", and [[Iron Butterfly]]'s 17-minute-long "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]].".&lt;ref name="Sounes" /&gt;

The 1960s saw the protest song gain a sense of political self-importance, with Phil Ochs's "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]" and Country Joe and the Fish's "[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die-Rag]]" among the many anti-war anthems that were important to the era.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;

[[Free jazz]] is an approach to [[jazz]] music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Although the music produced by free jazz composers varied widely, the common feature was a dissatisfaction with the limitations of [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]], which had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Each in their own way, free jazz musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down the conventions of jazz, often by discarding hitherto invariable features of jazz, such as fixed [[chord change]]s or [[tempo]]s. While usually considered experimental and avant-garde, free jazz has also oppositely been conceived as an attempt to return jazz to its "primitive", often religious roots, and emphasis on collective improvisation. Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Cecil Taylor]] and the later works of saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]. Other important pioneers included [[Charles Mingus]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]], [[Joe Maneri]] and [[Sun Ra]]. Although today "free jazz" is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including "avant-garde", "energy music" and "The New Thing". During its early and mid-60s heyday, much free jazz was released by established labels such as Prestige, Blue Note and Impulse, as well as independents such as [[ESP Disk]] and BYG Actuel. [[Free improvisation]] or ''free music'' is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the logic or inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable genre in its own right. [[Free improvisation]], as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of [[free jazz]] and [[contemporary music|modern classical]] musics. None of its primary exponents can be said to be famous within mainstream; however, in experimental circles, a number of free musicians are well known, including saxophonists [[Evan Parker]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Peter Brötzmann]] and [[John Zorn]], drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], guitarists [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Fred Frith]] and the improvising groups The [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] and [[AMM (group)|AMM]].

[[Allmusic Guide]] states that "until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, "[[jazz-rock]]" (or "jazz/rock") is often used as a synonym for the term "[[Fusion jazz|jazz fusion]]". However, some make a distinction between the two terms. [[The Free Spirits]] have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz-rock band.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unterberger1998|Unterberger 1998]], pg. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s, at the same time that jazz musicians were experimenting with rock rhythms and electric instruments, rock groups such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] were "beginning to incorporate elements of jazz into their music" by "experimenting with extended free-form improvisation". Other "groups such as [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]] directly borrowed harmonic, melodic, rhythmic and instrumentational elements from the jazz tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liraproductions.com/jazzrock/htdocs/histhome.htm The Jazz/Rock Fusion Page:a site is dedicated to Jazz Fusion and related genres with a special emphasis on Jazz/Rock fusion]&lt;/ref&gt; The rock groups that drew on jazz ideas (like [[Soft Machine]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] and [[Frank Zappa]]) turned the blend of the two styles with electric instruments.&lt;ref name="tesser"&gt;N. Tesser, ''The Playboy Guide to Jazz'', (Plume, 1998), {{ISBN|0452276489}}, P. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late 1960s and early 70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer-songwriter movement."&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2776|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles Davis]]' ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' sessions, recorded in August 1969 and released the following year, mostly abandoned jazz's usual swing beat in favor of a [[rock music|rock]]-style [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] anchored by [[electric bass]] grooves. The recording "... mixed free jazz blowing by a large ensemble with electronic keyboards and guitar, plus a dense mix of percussion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm Jazzitude &amp;#124; History of Jazz Part 8: Fusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114032732/http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm |date=January 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis also drew on the rock influence by playing his trumpet through electronic effects and pedals. While the album gave Davis a [[gold record]], the use of electric instruments and rock beats created a great deal of consternation amongst some more conservative jazz critics.

{{Main|1960s in film}}
The counterculture was not only affected by cinema, but was also instrumental in the provision of era-relevant content and talent for the film industry. ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' struck a chord with the youth as "the alienation of the young in the 1960s was comparable to the director's image of the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Jackson and J. E. O'Connor, 1980, P237&lt;/ref&gt; Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media.

In France the [[french new wave|New Wave]] was a [[blanket term]] coined by critics for a group of [[Cinema of France|French filmmakers]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, influenced by [[Italian Neorealism]] and [[classical Hollywood cinema]]. Although never a formally organized movement, the New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful [[iconoclasm]] and is an example of [[European art cinema]]. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. The Left Bank, or ''Rive Gauche'', group is a contingent of filmmakers associated with the French New Wave, first identified as such by [[Richard Roud]].&lt;ref name=hfa&gt;"The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda", ''Harvard Film Archive'', [http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907190306/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html |date=September 7, 2015 }} Access date: August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding "right bank" group is constituted of the more famous and financially successful New Wave directors associated with ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' ([[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]).&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Left Bank directors include [[Chris Marker]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Agnès Varda]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Roud described a distinctive "fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making", as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Other film "new waves" from around the world associated with the 1960s are [[New German Cinema]], [[Czechoslovak New Wave]], Brazilian [[Cinema Novo]] and [[Japanese New Wave]]. During the 1960s, the term "[[art film]]" began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly, to include foreign-language (non-English) [[auteur theory|"auteur"]] films, [[independent film]]s, [[experimental film]]s, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s  "art film" became a euphemism in the U.S. for racy Italian and French [[B-movies]]. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe [[pornography|sexually explicit]] European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]''. The 1960s was an important period in art film; the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the [[European art cinema]] which had countercultural traits in filmmakers such as [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].

Cultural historians–such as [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] in his 1986 essay "From Satori to Silicon Valley" and John Markoff in his book ''[[What the Dormouse Said]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html "From Satori to Silicon Valley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070447/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html |date=June 8, 2011 }} - Roszak, Stanford&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out that many of the early pioneers of [[personal computing]] emerged from within the West Coast counterculture. Many early computing and networking pioneers, after discovering [[LSD]] and roaming the campuses of UC Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT in the late 1960s and early 1970s, would emerge from this caste of social "misfits" to shape the modern world of technology, especially in [[Silicon Valley]].

===Religion, spirituality and the occult===

Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. If they adhered to mainstream faiths, hippies were likely to embrace [[Buddhism]], [[Daoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]] and the [[restorationist]] Christianity of the [[Jesus Movement]]. Some hippies embraced [[neo-paganism]], especially [[Wicca]]. Wicca is a witchcraft religion which became more prominent beginning in 1951, with the repeal of the [[1735 Witchcraft Act|Witchcraft Act of 1735]], after which [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and then others such as [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Cecil Williamson]] began publicising their own versions of the Craft. Gardner and others never used the term "Wicca" as a religious identifier, simply referring to the "witch cult", "witchcraft", and the "Old Religion". However, Gardner did refer to witches as "the Wica".&lt;ref name="WitchcraftToday"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald B |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) |title=Witchcraft Today |publisher=Mercury Publishing |location=Lake Toxaway, NC |year=1999 |origyear=1954 |oclc=44936549 |isbn=978-0-8065-2593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the name of the religion normalised to "Wicca".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=vii}}&lt;ref name="Seims 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica_or_wicca.htm |title=Wica or Wicca? – Politics and the Power of Words |journal=The Cauldron |first=Melissa |last=Seims |issue=129 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's tradition, later termed [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerianism]], soon became the dominant form in [[England]] and spread to other parts of the [[British Isles]]. Following Gardner's death in 1964, the Craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in British tabloids, with new traditions being propagated by figures like [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], [[Sybil Leek]] and most importantly [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], whose [[Alexandrian Wicca]], which was predominantly based upon Gardnerian Wicca, albeit with an emphasis placed on [[ceremonial magic]], spread quickly and gained much media attention.

In his 1991 book, ''Hippies and American Values'', Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a "religious movement" whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. "Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7F31yYxOMAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;q=hippie%20as%20a%20religious%20movements |first=Timothy|last= Miller|title=Hippies and American Values |publisher=Univ Tennessee Press; 1st edition|accessdate=October 11, 2013|isbn=9780870496943|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal, contemporaneous work, ''The Hippie Trip'', author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called "high priests" who emerged during that era.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hippie Trip'', Lewis Yablonsky, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

One such hippie "high priest" was San Francisco State College instructor [[Stephen Gaskin]]. Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's "Monday Night Class" eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings. In 1970, Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]], and he still lists his religion as "Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |title=Communal Religions |publisher=Thefarm.org |date=October 6, 1966 |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511184303/http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/12/new_book_tells_inside_story_of_biggest_hippie_comm.php |title=New Book Tells Inside Story Of Biggest Hippie Commune In U.S. - Toke of the Town - cannabis news, views, rumor and humor |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stephen Gaskin |isbn=9781570671814 |title=Monday Night Class |publisher=Amazon.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Leary was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents based on a "freedom of religion" argument. ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' was the inspiration for John Lennon's song "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" in The Beatles' album ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="Sante"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sante| first = Luc| title = The Nutty Professor | work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]| date = June 26, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25sante.html| accessdate = July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet in 1967 called ''Start Your Own Religion'' to encourage just that (see below under "writings") and was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]]  a gathering of 30,000 [[hippie]]s in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]] In speaking to the group, he coined the famous phrase "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eFaq_I24teQC&amp;pg=PA641 |title=Timothy Leary: A Biography|first=Robert|last= Greenfield |accessdate=October 11, 2013|isbn=9780151005000|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' is the founding text of [[Discordianism]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). It was originally published under the title "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The title, literally meaning "Discordant Principles", is in keeping with the tendency of [[Latin]] to prefer hypotactic grammatical arrangements. In English, one would expect the title to be "Principles of Discord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and legacy==
The lasting impact, including unintended consequences, creative output and general legacy of the counterculture era continue to be actively discussed, debated, despised and celebrated.

Even the notions of when the counterculture subsumed the Beat Generation, when it gave way to the successor generation, and what happened in between are open for debate. According to notable UK Underground and counterculture author Barry Miles, "It seemed to me that the Seventies was when most of the things that people attribute to the sixties really happened: this was the age of extremes, people took more drugs, had longer hair, weirder clothes, had more sex, protested more violently and encountered more opposition from the establishment. It was the era of sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, as [[Ian Dury]] said. The countercultural explosion of the 1960s really only involved a few thousand people in the UK and perhaps ten times that in the USA – largely because of opposition to the Vietnam war, whereas in the Seventies the ideas had spread out across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=In the Seventies: Adventures in the Counterculture (Comments from the Author's Website)|url=http://barrymiles.co.uk/all-books/in-the-seventies/|website=barrymiles.co.uk|publisher=Barry Miles|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Columbia University teaching unit on the counterculture era notes: "Although historians disagree over the influence of the counterculture on American politics and society, most describe the counterculture in similar terms. Virtually all authors—for example, on the right, [[Robert Bork]] in [[Slouching Towards Gomorrah|''Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline'']] (New York: Regan Books,1996) and, on the left, [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1987)—characterize the counterculture as self-indulgent, childish, irrational, narcissistic, and even dangerous. Even so, many liberal and leftist historians find constructive elements in it, while those on the right tend not to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235327/http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-28 |title=The Legacy of the Counterculture |last1=George |first1=Jason |date=2004 |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen legend [[John Wayne]] equated aspects of 1960s social programs with the rise of the [[welfare state]], "... I know all about that. In the late Twenties, when I was a sophomore at USC, I was a socialist myself—but not when I left. The average college kid idealistically wishes everybody could have ice cream and cake for every meal. But as he gets older and gives more thought to his and his fellow man's responsibilities, he finds that it can't work out that way—that some people just won't carry their load ... I believe in welfare—a welfare work program. I don't think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I'd like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I'd like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters.

The "generation gap" between the affluent young and their often poverty-scarred parents was a critical component of 1960s culture. In an interview with journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] during the 1968 US presidential campaign, soon-to-be First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] exposed the generational chasm in worldview between Steinem, 20 years her junior, and herself after Steinem probed Mrs. Nixon as to her youth, role models, and lifestyle. A hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, Pat Nixon told Steinem, "I never had time to think about things like that, who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do ... I've kept working. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I never had it easy. I'm not at all like you ... all those people who had it easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halberstam|first1=David|title=The Fifties|date=1993|publisher=Random House/Villard|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-41559-6|page=324|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the counterculture movement reached its peak of influence, the concept of the adoption of socially-responsible policies by establishment corporations was discussed by economist and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] (1962): "Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine. If businessmen do have a social responsibility other than making maximum profits for stockholders, how are they to know what it is? Can self-selected private individuals decide what the social interest is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silk|first1=Leonard|last2=Silk|first2=Mark|title=The American Establishment|date=1980|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00134-7|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, author and former Free Speech activist [[Greil Marcus]] was quoted, "What happened four decades ago is history. It's not just a blip in the history of trends. Whoever shows up at a march against war in Iraq, it always takes place with a memory of the efficacy and joy and gratification of similar protests that took place in years before ... It doesn't matter that there is no counterculture, because counterculture of the past gives people a sense that their own difference matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/style/a-movement-yes-but-no-counterculture.html? |title=A Movement, Yes, but No Counterculture

When asked about the prospects of the counterculture movement moving forward in the digital age, former Grateful Dead lyricist and self-styled "cyberlibertarian" [[John Perry Barlow]] said, "I started out as a teenage beatnik and then became a hippie and then became a cyberpunk. And now I'm still a member of the counterculture, but I don't know what to call that. And I'd been inclined to think that that was a good thing, because once the counterculture in America gets a name then the media can coopt it, and the advertising industry can turn it into a marketing foil. But you know, right now I'm not sure that it is a good thing, because we don't have any flag to rally around.

During the era, conservative students objected to the counterculture and found ways to celebrate their conservative ideals by reading books like [[J.

Free Speech advocate and social anthropologist  Jentri Anders observed that a number of freedoms were endorsed within a countercultural community in which she lived and studied: "freedom to explore one's potential, freedom to create one's Self, freedom of personal expression, freedom from scheduling, freedom from rigidly defined roles and hierarchical statuses ..." Additionally, Anders believed some in the counterculture wished to modify children's education so that it didn't discourage, but rather encouraged, "aesthetic sense, love of nature, passion for music, desire for reflection, or strongly marked independence."&lt;ref&gt;Jentri Anders, Beyond Counterculture, Washington State University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitchell, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

We've embraced diversity in a lot of ways in this country. I do think it's done us a tremendous service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/SUMMER-OF-LOVE-40-YEARS-LATER-Just-a-season-2559193.php#photo-2702198 |title=SUMMER OF LOVE: 40 YEARS LATER

==Key figures==
[[File:Jerry Rubin - Spectrum 13Mar1970.jpg|thumb|Jerry Rubin, University at Buffalo, March 10, 1970]]

The following people are well known for their involvement in 1960s era counterculture. Some are key incidental or contextual figures, such as Beat Generation figures who also participated directly in the later counterculture era. The primary area(s) of each figure's notability are indicated, per these figures' Wikipedia pages. This section is not intended be exhaustive, but rather a representative cross section of individuals active within the larger movement. Although many of the people listed are known for civil rights activism, some figures whose primary notability was within the realm of the Civil Rights Movement are listed elsewhere.  This section is not intended to create associations between any of the listed figures beyond what is documented elsewhere. (see also: [[List of civil rights leaders]]; [[New Left#New Left|Key figures of the New Left]]; [[Timeline of 1960s counterculture]]). &lt;!-- all people listed below should have Wikipedia articles --&gt;

Danmarks Grimmeste Festival features a broad range of genres, including rock, pop, electronic, hip hop and punk music. It is based on volunteers and about 5,000 people attended the 2015 festival. The festival started out as a garden party of four friends at the farm in 2004, and has grown continuously. The 2015 event was the 12th festival and lasted three days from 30 July to 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://stiften.dk/kultur/danmarks-grimmeste-festival-for-12.-gang|title=Danmarks Grimmeste Festival for 12. gang|newspaper=Århus Stiftstidende|author=Thomas Nygaard|date=30 July 2015|language=Danish|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De-extinction''', or '''resurrection biology''', or '''species revivalism''' is the process of creating an [[organism]], which is either a member of, or resembles an [[extinct species]], or breeding population of such organisms.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170320"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yin |first=Steph |title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species.

Similar techniques have been applied to [[endangered species]].

There is significant controversy over de-extinction.&lt;ref name="minteer_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minteer | first1 = BA | year = 2014 | title = Is it right to reverse extinction? | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 509 | issue = 7500| page = 261 | doi=10.1038/509261a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics assert that efforts would be better spent conserving existing species, that the [[habitat]] necessary for formerly extinct species to survive is too limited to warrant de-extinction, and that the evolutionary conservation benefits of these operations are questionable.&lt;ref name="robert_et_al_2016"&gt;A Robert, C Thévenin, K Princé, F Sarrazin, J Clavel (2016) De-extinction and Evolution [[Functional Ecology (journal)|Functional Ecology]] {{DOI|10.1111/1365-2435.12723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
===Cloning===
[[Cloning]] is the method discussed as an option for bringing back extinct species, by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into the egg of the nearest living relative. This egg can then be inserted into a relative host. It is important to note that this method can only be used when a preserved cell is available. This means that it is most feasible for recently extinct species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/should-we-bring-extinct-species-back-dead|title=Should we bring extinct species back from the dead?|date=2016-09-23|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pyrenean ibex Cloning.svg|thumb|left|Pictured above is the process used to clone the [[Pyrenean ibex]] in 2003. The tissue culture was taken from the last living, female Pyrenean ibex named Celia. The egg was taken from a [[goat]] (''Capra hircus'') and the nuclei removed to ensure the offspring was purely Pyrenean ibex. The egg was implanted into a surrogate goat mother for development.]]

Although de-extinction efforts have not yet succeeded in producing viable offspring of a previously extinct species, the same process has been applied successfully to endangered species. The [[banteng]] is an endangered species that was successfully [[cloning|cloned]], and the first to survive for more than a week (the first was a [[gaur]] that died two days after being born).&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax Digital, [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/08/1049567684834.html Banteng clone leads charge for endangered animals], April 9, 2003.

Visited October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists at [[Advanced Cell Technology]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], United States extracted [[DNA]] from banteng cells kept in the [[San Diego Zoo]]'s "[[Ex-situ conservation|Frozen Zoo]]" facility, and transferred it into eggs from domestic cattle, a process called [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]. Thirty hybrid embryos were created and sent to [[Trans Ova Genetics]], which implanted the fertilized eggs in domestic cattle. Two were carried to term and delivered by [[Caesarian section]].&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Cell Technology, [http://www.advancedcell.com/press-release/collaborative-effort-yields-endangered-species-clone Collaborative Effort Yields Endangered Species Clone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023235648/http://www.advancedcell.com/press-release/collaborative-effort-yields-endangered-species-clone |date=2006-10-23 }}, April 8, 2003.  Visited October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The first hybrid was born on April 1, 2003, and the second two days later.

Scientists from the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and the University of New South Wales, including Andrew French, Michael Mahony, Simon Clulow and Mike Archer reported in May 2013 the successful cloning of the extinct frog ''[[Rheobatrachus silus]]'' using the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer. The embryos developed for several days but died. In an important development the scientists from Newcastle reported associated technologies that provide a "proof of concept" for the proposal that frozen zoos (also referred to as genome banks and seed banks) are an effective mechanism to provide an insurance against species extinction and the loss of population genetic diversity. They connected the circle between de-extinction and the prevention of extinction for threatened animal species. The important advances were the capacity to successfully recover live frozen embryonic cells from animals that produce large yolky eggs ([[anamniotes]] such as fishes and amphibians)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawson|first1=Bianca |last2=Clulow |first2=Mahony |title=Towards Gene Banking Amphibian Maternal Germ Lines: Short-Term Incubation, Cryoprotectant Tolerance and Cryopreservation of Embryonic Cells of the Frog, Limnodynastes peronii |journal=PLoS ONE |year=2013 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=e60760.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060760 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060760 |pmid=23577155 |pmc=3618038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kouba |first1=Andrew |last2=Lloyd |first2=RE |last3=Houck |first3=ML |last4=Silla |first4=AJ |last5=Calatayud |first5=N |last6=Trudeau |first6=VL |last7=Clulow |first7=J |last8=Molinia |first8=F |last9=Langhorne |first9=C |last10=Vance |first10=C |last11=Arregui |first11=L |last12=Germano |first12=J |last13=Lermen |first13=D |last14=Della |first14=Togna, G.|title=Emerging trends for biobanking amphibian genetic resources: The hope, reality and challenges for the next decade |journal=Biological Conservation |year=2013 |volume=164 |pages=10–21 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2013.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clulow |first1=John |last2=Clulow |first2=S |last3=Jitong |first3=G |last4=French |first4=AJ |last5=Mahony |first5=MJ |last6=Archer |first6=Michael |last7=M|title=Optimisation of an oviposition protocol employing human chorionic and pregnant mare serum gonadotropins in the Barred Frog Mixophyes fasciolatus (Myobatrachidae) |journal=Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 10:60. |year=2013 |volume=10 |page=60 |doi=10.1186/1477-7827-10-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this development is combined with [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT) it enables the genome to be recovered. The scientists point out that many embryonic cells can be frozen and when combined with frozen sperm storage enables the genetic diversity of populations to be stored. With groups of vertebrates such as the amphibians facing an extinction crisis they propose this as an effective means to prevent extinction while the causes of declines can be identified and remedied. The technical difference between frozen tissue samples commonly used for genetic studies (e.g. [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] reconstruction) and those in a frozen zoo is the use of cryoprotectants and special freezing rates at the time of freezing and thawing.

=== Genome editing ===
With recent, rapid advances in genome sequencing and assembly, and gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9, it may soon be possible to insert relevant genes from extinct species into the genomes of their closest extant relatives. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|date=2016-08-09|title=Pathways to de-extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/1365-2435.12705|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996–1002|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|issn=0269-8463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the methods needed to carry out genome editing for de-extinction are advancing, there are still several limitations. First, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging. Additionally, a close relative must be living and able to be reared in captivity for insertion of edited cells. Because a near relative is used as a host for the edited cells, the resulting individuals will not be exactly the same as the extinct species, but may also possess traits of the extant relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/Rep-2016-009.pdf|title=Guiding Principles on Creating Proxies of Extinct Species for Conservation Benefit|last=IUCN SSC|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective breeding===
Selective breeding is the process by which living relatives of the extinct species are identified and specifically mated to reproduce the traits of the extinct species. This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[aurochs]], which became extinct in 1627, could possibly be brought back by taking DNA samples from bone and teeth fragments in museums in order to obtain genetic material to recreate its DNA. Researchers would then compare the DNA to that of modern European [[cattle]] to determine which breeds still carry the creature's genes, and then undertake a selective breeding program to reverse the evolutionary process. The intention would be that with every passing generation, the cattle would more closely resemble the ancient aurochs.&lt;ref name="Breeding Ancient Cattle Back from Extinction"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1961918,00.html|title=Breeding Ancient Cattle Back from Extinction|date=12 February 2010|work=TIME.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[quagga]], a subspecies of zebra which has been extinct since the 1880s, has been revived using selective breeding of [[zebras]]. Since the new animal is not genetically identical to the extinct subspecies, the new animal is called the [[Rau quagga]].&lt;ref name="Zebra cousin became extinct 100 years ago.

''[[Chelonoidis elephantopus]]'', an extinct tortoise, originally discovered on the [[Galapagos Islands]] by [[Charles Darwin]], has hopes of being revived through selective breeding. A group of scientists have collected over 1,700 blood samples from tortoises on [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela Island]] during an expedition in 2012 having identified 80 tortoises with traces of the extinct species DNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_GALAPAGOS_EXTINCT_TURTLE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2017-09-13-18-30-43 Scientists Hope to Restore Extinct Tortoise]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments ==

=== Arguments against de-extinction ===
Opponents of de-extinction have claimed that efforts and resources used to resurrect extinct species could have been better used trying to conserve endangered species that might themselves become extinct.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nature-up/2013/jun/07/deextinction-critics-scientific-american | title=De-extinction critics at Scientific American have missed the point | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=2013-06-07 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Welz | date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring in the journal ''Life Sciences, Society and Policy'', a 2014 article claimed that the cost of reviving just a single species could amount to millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cottrell|first1=Sarah|last2=Jensen|first2=Jamie|last3=Peck|first3=Steven|title=Resuscitation and resurrection: The ethics of cloning cheetahs, mammoths, and Neanderthals|journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy|date=10 January 2014|volume=10|issue=3|url=https://lsspjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2195-7819-10-3|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, more than 20,000 extant species are currently threatened with extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IUCN|title=Annual Report IUCN 2015|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|publisher=International Union for the Conservation of Nature|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the negative impacts on extant species could be highly direct. For instance, it is proposed that the Asian elephant would act as a surrogate mother for the woolly mammoth embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pina-Aguilar|first1=R.E.|last2=Et al.|title=Revival of extinct species using nuclear transfer: hope for the mammoth, true for the Pyrenean ibex, but is it time for "conservation cloning"?|journal=Cloning and Stem Cells|date=11 September 2009|volume=11|issue=3|pages=341–6|pmid=19594389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian elephant is currently endangered, and it could be detrimental to its existence to use the few individuals left to bring back another species.

It has also been noted that a resurrected species, while being genetically the same as previously living specimens, will not have the same behaviour as its predecessors. The first animal to be brought back will be raised by parents of a different species (the fetus's host), not the one that died out and thus have differing mothering techniques and other behaviors.&lt;ref name="back to life"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://t.nbcnews.com/science/how-bring-extinct-animals-back-life-8C10995683|title=How to bring extinct animals back to life|last=Lewis|first=Tanya|date=August 24, 2013|work=National Geographic|accessdate=23 November 2014|agency=NBCNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that de-extinction plans have not discussed bringing back parasites or mutualists which co-existed with extinct species, which may have strong effects on the survival and success of resurrected species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selbach|first=Christian|last2=Seddon|first2=Philip J.|last3=Poulin|first3=Robert|date=January 2018|title=Parasites Lost: Neglecting a Crucial Element in De-Extinction|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471492217301915|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=9–11|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2017.08.003|issn=1471-4922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have published ethical concerns regarding de-extinction. In ''Conservation Biology'', Robert Sandler argues that introducing extinct species to environments may produce harm to modern species, as invasive species. Issues regarding scientific hubris, human and animal health, and the ecology of sensitive environments have been raised by the scientific community. Further research must be performed regarding de-extinction to investigate advantages and disadvantages to the technology. New technological practices must be examined to prevent environmental hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandler|first1=Robert|title=The ethics of reviving long extinct species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=354–356|doi=10.1111/cobi.12198}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for de-extinction===

Counter arguments have been made, however, in regards to the benefits of bringing back extinct species. Harvard geneticist, [[George M. Church|George Church]], gives an example of the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment. He explains that if the newly developed mammoth hybrids were to be placed in areas such as Siberia and Alaska, the outcome may reverse the damage that [[global warming]] has caused.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Church, George. "George Church: De-Extinction Is a Good Idea." Scientific American. Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc., 1 Sept. 2013. Web. 13 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and their characteristic of felling trees would increase the absorption of sunlight. If the theories are proven true, global warming could eventually be lessened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'', in an editorial condemning de-extinction, pointed out that the technologies involved could have secondary applications, specifically to help species on the verge of extinction regain their [[genetic diversity]], for example the [[black-footed ferret]] or the [[northern white rhinoceros]]. It noted, however, that such research "should be conducted under the mantle of preserving modern biodiversity rather than conjuring extinct species from the grave."&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt;

It's been argued that revived species can be utilised as a tool to support other conservation initiatives by acting as a "[[flagship species]]" - a charismatic organism that generates popular support and funds for conserving entire ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Joseph|title=Biodiversity gains from efficient use of private sponsorship for flagship species conservation|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=25 March 2015|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1805/20142693|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along this vein, it is thought that resurrecting the aurochs would boost the European "rewilding" movement, in turn, transforming abandoned farmland into wildlife corridors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittle|first1=Patrick|last2=Et al.|title=Re-creation tourism: de-extinction and its implications for nature-based recreation|journal=Current Issues In Tourism|date=12 Dec 2014|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13683500.2015.1031727|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; De-extinction would act as a kind of "flagship technology' where the excitement stirred from the possibility of seeing an extinct species in the wild strengthens the focus on preserving ecosystems. Similarly, the conservationist Josh Donlan claims that if the passenger pigeon were resurrected, there would inevitably be a legal impetus for the protection of its habitat under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donlan|first1=Josh|title=De-extinction in a crisis discipline|journal=Frontiers of Biogeography|date=2014|volume=6|issue=1|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2x70q4nk/qt2x70q4nk.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current candidates for de-extinction ==
[[File:Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) - Mauricio Antón.jpg|thumb|The woolly mammoth (''Mammthus primigenius'') is a candidate for de-extinction using either cloning or genome editing.]]

=== Woolly Mammoth ===
The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and [[DNA]] of [[woolly mammoth]]s has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first is [[cloning]], which would involve removal of the DNA-containing [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the [[Ovum|egg cell]] of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and inserted back into a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. To date, even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.&lt;ref name="Lister 2007 42 43"&gt;Lister, 2007. pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43&lt;/ref&gt; The second method involves [[artificially inseminating]] an elephant egg cell with [[sperm]] cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring would be an elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are potent for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method.&lt;ref name="Lister 2007 42 43" /&gt; In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named [[Motty]], but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=R.|year=1999|title=Cloning the Woolly Mammoth|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1999/apr/cover|journal=Discover Magazine|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years. They hope to use similar methods to find usable mammoth DNA.&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,446570,00.html|title=Cloned Mammoths Made More Likely by Frozen Mice|date=5 November 2008|work=FOX News|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Japanese scientists announced plans to clone mammoths within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/17/scientists-trying-to-clone-resurrect-extinct-mammoth/?hpt=T2|title=Scientists trying to clone, resurrect extinct mammoth|last=Lendon|first=B.|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=22 May 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the woolly mammoth genome has been mapped, a complete strand of DNA may be synthesised in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mammoth.psu.edu|title=Mammoth Genome Project|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammoth expert Adrian Lister questions the ethics of such recreation attempts. In addition to the technical problems, he notes that there is not much habitat left that would be suitable for woolly mammoths. Because the species was [[gregarious]], creating a few specimens would not be ideal. He also notes that the time and resources required would be enormous, and that the scientific benefits would be unclear; these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered.&lt;ref name="Lister 2007 42 43" /&gt; However, it was reported in March 2014 that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 now provides a "High chance" of cloning the woolly mammoth, despite previous hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/welcome-pleistocene-park-russian-scientists-say-high-chance-cloning-woolly-mammoth/|title=Welcome to Pleistocene Park: Russian scientists say they have a ‘high chance’ of cloning a woolly mammoth|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to revive the woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living in a much colder environment than modern day elephants. This is currently being done by Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church|George Church]], and they have already successfully made changes in the elephant genome with the genes that gave the woolly mammoth its cold-resistant blood, longer hair, and extra layer of fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-plan-to-turn-elephants-into-woolly-mammoths-is-already-underway|title=The Plan to Turn Elephants Into Woolly Mammoths Is Already Underway|work=Motherboard|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revived woolly mammoth or mammoth-elephant hybrid may find suitable habitat in the tundra and taiga forest ecozones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/hendrik_poinar_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth|title=Hendrik Poinar: Bring back the woolly mammoth! - Talk Video - TED.com|author=Hendrik Poinar|publisher=Ted.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also find refuge in [[Pleistocene Park]], a [[Pleistocene rewilding]] experiment by Russian scientist [[Sergey Zimov]] to recreate the mammoth steppe, the former habitat of the woolly mammoth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/|title=Pleistocene Park: Restoration of the Mammoth Steppe Ecosystem|publisher=Pleistocenepark.ru|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mammoths are not required for the recreation of the steppe, they would be highly effective in doing so by quickly clearing brush and forest and allowing grasses to colonize the area, a capability that modern arctic [[megafauna]] do not have.

=== Pyrenean ibex ===
The [[Pyrenean ibex]] was one of four original subspecies of [[Spanish ibex]] that roamed on the Iberian peninsula. However, while it was abundant during [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park|Ordesa National Park]]. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into [[domestic goat]] egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de-extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]], and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25052233|title=BBC News – Fresh effort to clone extinct animal|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aurochs ===
The [[Aurochs]] was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''[[Aurochs|Bos primigenius primigenius]]'') survived into historic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0|title=Bos primigenius|publisher=Iucnredlist.org|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature – Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]], in which they were used as fighting animals for entertainment, and were noted by [[Julius Caesar]] for their strength and prowess. Following the fall of the [[Roman empire]], however, overhunting of the aurochs by nobility and royalty caused its population to dwindle to a single population in the [[Jaktorów]] forest in Poland, where the last wild aurochs, a female, died of natural causes in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8280392&amp;fileId=S1014233900004582|title=Cambridge Journals Online – Animal Genetic Resources / Resources génétiques animales / Recursos genéticos animales – Abstract – HISTORY OF THE AUROCHS (''BOS TAURUS PRIMIGENIUS'') IN POLAND|publisher=Journals.cambridge.org|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the auroch is ancestral to most modern cattle breeds and has close relatives in primitive cattle breeds, it is possible for it (or a superficial ecological replacement) to be brought back through artificial selection. The first attempt at this was by [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]] using modern cattle breeds, which resulted in the creation of [[Heck cattle]]. This breed has been introduced to nature preserves across Europe; however, it differs strongly from the aurochs in both physical characteristics and behavior, and modern attempts have tried to create an animal that is nearly identical to the aurochs in morphology, behavior, and even genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/jurassic-farm-can-bring-prehistoric-barnyard-animals-back-extinction/|title=Jurassic Farm – Modern Farmer|work=Modern Farmer|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[TaurOs Project]] aims to recreate the aurochs through selectively breeding primitive cattle breeds over a course of twenty years to create a self-sufficient bovine grazer in herds of at least 150 animals in rewilded nature areas across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atnatureza.org/index.php/en/projects-hidder/2-uncategorised/125-programa-tauros-en|title=TaurOs Programme|author=Bárbara Pais|publisher=Atnatureza.org|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134425/http://www.atnatureza.org/index.php/en/projects-hidder/2-uncategorised/125-programa-tauros-en#|archive-date=2014-10-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization is partnered with the organization Rewilding Europe to help restore balance to European nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewildingeurope.com/tauros-programme/|title=Tauros Programme|author=OKIA|publisher=Rewildingeurope.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competing project to recreate the aurochs is the [[Uruz Project]] by the True Nature Foundation, which aims to recreate the aurochs through a more efficient breeding strategy and through genome editing, in order to decrease the number of generations of breeding needed and the ability to quickly eliminate undesired traits from the new aurochs population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truenaturefoundation.org/wildlife/aurochs|title=Aurochs|publisher=|access-date=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116173809/http://www.truenaturefoundation.org/wildlife/aurochs#|archive-date=2015-01-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the new aurochs will reinvigorate European nature by restoring its ecological role as a keystone species, and bring back biodiversity that disappeared following the decline of European megafauna, as well as helping to bring new economic opportunities related to European wildlife viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewildingeurope.com/publications/the-aurochs-born-to-be-wild/|title=The Aurochs – Born to be Wild|author=OKIA|publisher=Rewildingeurope.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quagga ===
The [[Quagga]] is a subspecies of the [[plains zebra]] that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to [[South Africa]], but was wiped out in the wild due to over-hunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Equus_quagga/|title=ADW: Equus quagga: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga could be revived through artificial selection.

[[File:"Benjamin".jpg|alt=|thumb|516x516px|The last known thylacine, named "Benjamin", died from neglect in the [[Hobart Zoo]] in 1936.]]

=== Thylacine ===
The [[Thylacine]] is native to continental [[Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[New Guinea]]. It is believed to have become [[extinct]] in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the [[Australia (continent)|Australian mainland]] before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including the [[Tasmanian devil]]. Intensive hunting encouraged by [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat. Despite its official classification as extinct, sightings are still reported, though none has been conclusively proven. The last known thylacine, named Benjamin, died at the [[Hobart Zoo]], on 7 September 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night.&lt;ref name="P195"&gt;[[De-extinction#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]], p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;  National Threatened Species Day has been held annually since 1996 on 7&amp;nbsp;September in Australia, to commemorate the death of the last officially recorded thylacine. Although there had been a conservation movement pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936.

Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.&lt;ref name="TSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/ts-day/index.html|title=National Threatened Species Day|year=2006|publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage, Australian Government|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709141827/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/ts-day/index.html|archivedate=July 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thylacine held the status of [[endangered species]] until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] in 1982&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;{{IUCN2010|id=21866|title=Thylacinus cynocephalus|downloaded=23 July 2010|version=2011.2|year=2008|assessor=McKnight, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) in 2013.&lt;ref name="CITES2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/notif/2013/E-Notif-2013-012.pdf|title=Amendments to appendices I and II of the Convention|date=19 April 2013|publisher=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Museum]] in Sydney began a [[cloning]] project in 1999.&lt;ref name="GU"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4424142,00.html|title=Back from the dead|author=Leigh, Julia|date=30 May 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to use [[genetics|genetic material]] from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to [[cloning|clone]] new individuals and restore the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists have dismissed the project as a public relations stunt and its chief proponent, [[Mike Archer (paleontologist)|Mike Archer]], received a 2002 nomination for the Australian Skeptics [[Bent Spoon Award]] for "the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo-scientific piffle."&lt;ref name="AGE"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/21/1029114134051.html|title=Tasmanian tiger clone a fantasy: scientist|date=22 August 2002|accessdate=28 December 2006|publisher=Melbourne Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable [[DNA]] from the specimens.&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/The-Thylacine|title=Attempting to make a genomic library of an extinct animal|year=1999|publisher=Australian Museum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414003805/http://australianmuseum.net.au/The-Thylacine|archivedate=14 April 2010|accessdate=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the DNA retrieved from the specimens had been too badly degraded to be usable.&lt;ref name="abc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200502/s1303501.htm|title=Museum ditches thylacine cloning project|date=15 February 2005|publisher=ABC News Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015173047/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200502/s1303501.htm|archivedate=15 October 2008|accessdate=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smhclone2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/tassie-tiger-cloning-pieinthesky-science/2005/02/16/1108500157295.html|title=Tassie tiger cloning 'pie-in-the-sky science'|author=Smith, Deborah|date=17 February 2005|accessdate=22 November 2006|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, Archer, the [[University of New South Wales]] Dean of Science at the time, former director of the [[Australian Museum]], and evolutionary biologist, announced that the project was being restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute.&lt;ref name="smhclone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Clone-again/2005/05/14/1116024405941.html|title=Researchers revive plan to clone the Tassie tiger|author=Dasey, Daniel|date=15 May 2005|accessdate=22 November 2006|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1302459.htm|title=Thylacine cloning project dumped|author=Skatssoon, Judy|date=15 February 2005|publisher=ABC Science Online|accessdate=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Thylacine Specimen Database]] was completed in April 2005, and is the culmination of a four-year research project to catalog and digitally photograph, if possible, all known&lt;ref name="CM2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/thylacine|title=Pelt of a thylacine shot in the Pieman River-Zeehan area of Tasmania in 1930: Charles Selby Wilson collection|publisher=National Museum of Australia, Canberra|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skins occasionally turn up in private ownership, such as the Wilson skin purchased by the National Museum of Australia in 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; surviving thylacine specimen material held within museum, university and private collections.

In December 2017 it was announced in [[Nature Ecology and Evolution]] that the full nuclear genome of the Thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008 with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/thylacine-genome-extinct-tasmanian-tiger-cloning-science/|title=Tasmanian Tiger Genome May Be First Step Toward De-Extinction|date=2017-12-11|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thylacine genome was reconstructed by mapping the thylacine genome to that of one of its closest living relatives, the [[Tasmanian devil]], and generating a reference based assembly of the full nuclear genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feigin|first=Charles Y.|last2=Newton|first2=Axel H.|last3=Doronina|first3=Liliya|last4=Schmitz|first4=Jürgen|last5=Hipsley|first5=Christy A.|last6=Mitchell|first6=Kieren J.|last7=Gower|first7=Graham|last8=Llamas|first8=Bastien|last9=Soubrier|first9=Julien|date=2017-12-11|title=Genome of the Tasmanian tiger provides insights into the evolution and demography of an extinct marsupial carnivore|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=182–192|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0417-y|issn=2397-334X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew J. Pask from the [[University of Melbourne]] has stated that the next step toward de-extinction will be to create a functional genome, which will require extensive research and development, estimating that a full attempt to resurrect the species may be possible as early as 2027.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

=== Passenger pigeon ===
The [[Passenger pigeon]] numbered in the billions before being wiped out due to commercial hunting and habitat loss. The non-profit Revive &amp; Restore obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive &amp; Restore focuses on identifying mutations in the DNA that would cause a phenotypic difference between the extinct passenger pigeon and its closest living relative the [[band-tailed pigeon]]. In doing this, they can determine how to modify the DNA of the band-tailed pigeon to change the traits to mimic the traits of the passenger pigeon. In this sense, the de-extinct passenger pigeon would not be genetically identical to the extinct passenger pigeon, but it would have the same traits. The de-extinct passenger pigeon hybrid is expected to be ready for captive breeding by 2024 released into the wild by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longnow.org/revive/what-we-do/passenger-pigeon//|title=Passenger Pigeon Comeback – Revive &amp; Restore|last=|first=|date=|work=Revive &amp; Restore|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future potential candidates for de-extinction==
&lt;!--Each of these must be sourced. Some of the existing sources (December 2015) appear to be unreliable.--&gt;

===Birds===

* [[Moa]] – this group of large (up to {{convert|12|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=sqbr}} tall and {{convert|250|lb|kg|-1|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=sqbr}}), flightless birds became extinct in approximately 1400 AD following the arrival and proliferation of the [[Maori people]] on New Zealand; however, intact DNA from both preserved specimens and eggshells makes the moa a candidate for resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/03/pictures/130305-bring-back-extinct-species/#/07-tedx-rebirth-moa_64855_600x450.jpg|title=Pictures: Extinct Species That Could Be Brought Back|work=National Geographic|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} New Zealand politician [[Trevor Mallard]] has suggested bringing back a medium-sized species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10216641/Time-to-bring-back-the-moa|title=Time to bring back... the moa|work=Stuff|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Heath hen]] – this subspecies of the prairie chicken became extinct on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in 1932 despite conservation efforts; however, the availability of usable DNA in museum specimens and protected areas in its former range makes this bird a possible candidate for de-extinction and reintroduction to its former habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvgazette.com/news/2014/07/24/heath-hen-debate-contains-vineyard-dna?k=vg53ebfb1806549|title=Heath Hen Debate Contains Vineyard DNA|work=The Vineyard Gazette – Martha's Vineyard News|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dodo]] – this large, flightless ground bird endemic to [[Mauritius]] became extinct in the 1640s due to exploitation by humans and due to introduced species such as rats and pigs, which ate their eggs. Due to a wealth of bones and some tissues, it is possible that this species may live again as it has a close relative in the surviving [[Nicobar pigeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/03/pictures/130305-bring-back-extinct-species/#/03-tedx-rebirth-dodo-skeleton_64851_600x450.jpg|title=Pictures: Extinct Species That Could Be Brought Back|work=National Geographic|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire dodo bird genome has been sequenced, but further steps towards de-extinction have not yet been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviverestore.org/dodo-bird-de-extinction-the-dialogue-has-begun-in-the-island-nation-of-mauritius/|title=Dodo Bird De-extinction?

* [[Elephant bird]] – of the largest birds to have ever existed, the elephant bird was driven to extinction by the early colonization of Madagascar. Ancient DNA has been obtained from the eggshells but may be too degraded for use in de-extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/7405923/Extinct-elephant-bird-of-Madagascar-could-live-again.html|title=Extinct elephant bird of Madagascar could live again|date=10 March 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Panthera leo spelaea|Cave lion]] - The discovery of two preserved cubs in the [[Sakha Republic]] ignited a project to clone the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/scientists-trying-to-clone-ice-age-cave-lion-after-finding-two-nearperfectly-preserved-cubs/news-story/2cd211fb23f944aa63e08862d564625e|title=Scientists to clone Ice Age cave lion|date=5 March 2016|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Steppe bison]] - The discovery of the mummified steppe bison of 9,000 years ago could help people clone the ancient bison species back, even though the steppe bison would not be the first to be "resurrected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/19666/20141106/9-000-year-old-bison-found-mummified-in-siberia.htm|title=9,000-year-old bison found mummified in Siberia|date=6 November 2014|work=techtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reptiles===
* [[List of species of Galápagos tortoise|Floreana Island Tortoise]] - In 2008, mitochondrial DNA from the Floreana tortoise species was found in museum specimens.  In theory, a breeding programme could be established to "resurrect" a pure Floreana race from living hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/40/15464.full |title=Historical DNA analysis reveals living descendants of an extinct species of Galápagos tortoise |publisher=PNAS |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ludden |first=Maizy |url=http://dailyorange.com/2017/11/extinct-tortoise-species-may-return-galapagos-thanks-suny-esf-professor/ |title=Extinct tortoise species may return to the Galápagos thanks to SUNY-ESF professor - The Daily Orange - The Independent Student Newspaper of Syracuse, New York |publisher=The Daily Orange |date=2017-11-12 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibians===
* [[Gastric-brooding frog]] - In 2013, scientists in Australia successfully created a living embryo from non-living preserved genetic material, and hopes by using somatic-cell nuclear transfer methods, they can produce an embryo that can survive to the tadpole stage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/scientists-successfully-create-living-embryo-extinct-species.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Detroit Windsor International Film Festival''' ('''DWIFF'''), launched in 2008, is a publicly attended [[film festival]] held each June in the [[Detroit–Windsor]] region, with events taking place in both [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]]. The festival is closely associated with [[Wayne State University]] as they incorporated their own pre-existing student film festival into the DWIFF and many of the festivities are held on Wayne State's campus in [[Midtown Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.withoutabox.com/03film/03t_fin/03t_fin_fest_01over.php?festival_id=6091&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Like most film festivals the DWIFF plays host to a variety of films ranging from student films to major Hollywood productions, but it is also known for special events that have been held as a part of the festival since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.detnews.com/article/20100624/ENT02/6240306/1034/ent02/Film-fest-stars-Michigan-talent&lt;/ref&gt;

===DWIFF Challenge===
Modeled after the [[48 Hour Film Project]] contestants are assigned a genre, a character, a prop, and a line of dialogue, and have 48 hours to create a short film containing those elements. The submissions are then judged and given their own screening as a part of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metromode.com/waynecounty/features/filmspotlight0014.aspx?referrerID=a5dd6703-2797-4d9e-ba52-a645803bdca3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tech Fair===
Held at [[Wayne State University]] the DWIFF Tech Fair provides viewers with a look at emerging technology and a variety of how-to courses on everything from personal electronics to film making.&lt;ref&gt;http://events.creativecow.net/event/210/detroit-windsor-international-film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

===MovingMedia===
Launched in 2001, MovingMedia is Wayne State University's official film festival. Inclusion in the festival is selective, and there is a juried competition with prizes. DWIFF and MovingMedia entered in partnership in 2009. The festival is open to local, national and international students. The festival includes 6 categories:
- Narrative,
- Documentary,
- Music Video,
- Experimental,
- Animation
- and New Media. 
For the first time in 2012, the festival was open to high school students.&lt;ref&gt;http://movingmediafilmfestival.com&lt;/ref&gt;
The festival usually occurs in June.

The '''Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market''' 2016/0280(COD), also known as the '''EU Copyright Directive''', is a controversial proposed [[European Union]] [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] intended to ensure "a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject-matter... taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content".&lt;ref name="EC2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52016PC0593|title= Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market|author=[[European Commission]]|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends existing [[copyright law of the European Union|European Union copyright law]] and is a component of the EU's [[Digital Single Market]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-copyright-legislation |title=The EU copyright legislation |author=European Commission|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First introduced by the [[European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs]] on 20{{Nbsp}}June 2018, the directive was approved by the European Parliament on 12{{Nbsp}}September 2018, and is currently passing through formal [[Formal Trilogue meeting|Trilogue]] discussions that are expected to conclude in January 2019. If formalised, each of the EU's member countries would then be required to enact laws to support the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/eu-article-13-passed-meme-war|title=The EU has passed Article 13, but Europe's meme war is far from over|last=Volpicelli|first=Gian|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Council]] describe their key goals as protecting press publications, reducing the "value gap" between the profits made by internet platforms and content creators, encouraging "collaboration" between these two groups, and creating [[copyright exceptions]] for [[text and data mining]].&lt;ref name="EUJune252"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/05/25/copyright-rules-for-the-digital-environment-council-agrees-its-position/|title=Copyright rules for the digital environment: Council agrees its position – Consilium|publisher=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive's specific proposals include giving press publishers direct copyright over use of their publications by internet platforms such as online [[News aggregator|news aggregators]] ([[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market#Article 11|Article 11]]) and requiring websites who primarily host [[User-generated content|content posted by users]] to take "effective and proportionate" measures to prevent unauthorised postings of copyrighted content or be liable for their users' actions ([[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market#Article 13|Article 13]]).

Articles 11 and 13 have attracted widespread criticism from European and American parties. Article 11 has been criticised as a "link tax" which would require websites "to obtain a license before linking to news stories",&lt;ref name="effdeeplinks"/&gt; and Article 13 as a "[[Internet meme|meme]] ban", on the basis that the content-matching technologies employed to meet its requirements cannot identify [[fair dealing]] such as [[parody]].&lt;ref name="BBC2018Meme" /&gt; Supporters of the directive, largely media groups and publishers, reject these arguments and claim that a [[disinformation]] and [[astroturfing]] campaign is being carried out by big internet platforms such as [[Google]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mythbuster"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersright.eu/mythbuster|title=MYTHBUSTER|last=|first=|date=|website=publishersright.eu|publisher=[[European Magazine Media Association]] and others|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukmusic.org/news/uk-music-chief-slams-google-as-corporate-vultures-as-figures-show-googles-3|title=UK Music chief slams Google as “corporate vultures” as figures show Google’s €31m EU lobbying bid|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[UK Music]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/google-funds-activist-site-that-pushes-its-views-rg2g5cr6t|title=Google funds website that spams for its causes|last=Media&amp;nbsp;Correspondent|first=Matthew Moore|date=2018-08-06|work=The Times|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018 Google began openly campaigning against the proposal, threatening to shut down [[YouTube]] in the EU unless concessions are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/saveyourinternet/|title=#SaveYourInternet - Article 13|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
The European Union's (EU) first attempt to unify copyrights in light of digital technologies was adopted in 2001 as the [[Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-528_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes adoption of the Directive on copyright in the information society by the Council|author=[[European Commission]]|date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive's major objectives were to harmonise EU legislation with international law (as set by the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaties), to strengthen intellectual property protection, to reduce conflicts in copyright laws between member states, and to assure adequate remuneration to content producers.&lt;ref name="CESP 2015"&gt;{{cite report | url = https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SR120_0.pdf | title = The Implementation, Application and Effects of the EU Directive on Copyright in the Information Society | authors = Andrea Renda, Felice Simonelli, Giuseppe Mazziotti, Alberto Bolognini and Giacomo Luchetta | publisher = [[Centre for European Policy Studies]] | date = November 2015 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some parts of the 2001 Directive were effective, other parts of the directive were not satisfactory for the current digital market long after its implementation. In 2012, the [[European Commission]] (EC) announced that they would be reviewing the 2001 Directive and having stakeholder discussions in light of several issues raised with failed copyright proposals from those in the [[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/battle-on-eu-copyright-law-re-opened-by-commission/|title=Battle on EU copyright law re-opened by Commission|date=5 December 2012|work=POLITICO|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC took public comments from December 2013 through March 2014, and published its first report on the state of the EU copyright law in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/docs/contributions/consultation-report_en.pdf|title=Report on the responses to the Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules|last=Directorate General Internal Market and Services Directorate D – Intellectual property D1|date=July 2014|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] was elected to the [[President of the European Commission|presidency of the European Commission]] and took office in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27679170 | title = Profile: EU's Jean-Claude Juncker | date =15 July 2014 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | publisher = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his campaign position, Juncker saw the potential to improve the EU's financial status by harmonising the various digital marketplaces among member nations to create job opportunities and drive a knowledge-based society. Juncker placed [[Andrus Ansip]] as Vice-President for the Digital Single Market within the EC that year, tasked with working with the [[European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society]] (at the time, [[Günther Oettinger]]) and other sections within the EC to come up with the necessary legislative steps that would be required to implement a Digital Single Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-523_en.htm | title = Questions and Answers: The Juncker Commission | date = 10 September 2014 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | publisher = [[European Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial plans for the legislative steps and their potential impact were announced by the EC in May 2015. Ansip stated that by the implementation of a Digital Single Market, they could increase the European [[gross domestic product]] by as much as {{€|415{{nbsp}}billion|link=yes}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/eu-unveils-plans-digital-single-market-online-firms |title = EU unveils plans to set up digital single market for online firms | first =Ian | last = Traynor | date = 6 May 2015 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1447773803386&amp;uri=CELEX:52015DC0192|title=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe|date=6 May 2015|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|series=COM/2015/0192|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Parliament]], following up on a report on the state of European Copyright from MEP [[Julia Reda]] that identified several inadequacies of the 2001 Copyright Directive, affirmed support for the EC's goal of a Digital Single Market as well as supporting an initiative with the EP for similar copyright reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2015-0273&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A8-2015-0209|title=European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2015 on the implementation of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (2014/2256(INI))|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC subsequently began working on establishing the legal framework by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2015:626:FIN|title=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – Towards a modern, more European copyright framework|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|series=COM/2015/0626|archive-date=9 December 2015|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative process===
The first draft of the proposed Directive from the EC was issued on 14{{Nbsp}}September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url = https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-593-EN-F1-1.PDF | title = Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Copyright in the Digital Single Market | date = 14 September 2016 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | publisher = [[European Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following revisions, the [[Council of the European Union]]'s [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER) approved of the EC's legislative directives on 25 May 2018 and prepared to bring the matter to vote in the EP,&lt;ref name="consilium_europa01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/35373/st09134-en18.pdf|title=Proposal for a directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market|last=|first=|date=25 May 2018|website=|page=26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a final text, without the support of Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium, or Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=22 June 2018|title=EU Council agrees Copyright Directive position|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/eu-council-agrees-copyright-directive-position/|newspaper=CREATe|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs]] finalised their amendments to the directive on 20 June 2018 and put them toward the parliament for negotiation.&lt;ref name="EUJune25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/05/25/copyright-rules-for-the-digital-environment-council-agrees-its-position/|title=Copyright rules for the digital environment: Council agrees its position|last=|first=|date=2018-05-25|website=|publisher=[[European Council]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) voted on 5{{Nbsp}}July 2018 not to proceed to the negotiation stage, but instead to reopen the directive for debate in September 2018.&lt;ref name="theguardianeuvote"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/05/youtube-could-escape-billions-in-copyright-payouts-after-eu-vote|title=YouTube and Facebook escape billions in copyright payouts after EU vote|last=Sweney|first=Mark|last2=Rankin|first2=Jennifer|date=2018-07-05|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rejectjuly-5-2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc235d20-803d-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d|title=MEPs reject EU copyright reforms in victory for internet giants|last=Khan|first=Mehreen|date=2018-07-05|website=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 318 votes to re-open the debate, 278 to proceed, and 31 abstentions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44712475|title=EU's controversial copyright plan rejected|date=2018-07-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/eu-parlament-zu-urheberrecht-umstrittene-reform-ueberraschend-ausgebremst-a-1216741.html |title=EU-Parlament bremst Urheberrechtsreform aus |access-date=2018-07-06 |date=2018-07-05 |last=Böhm |first=Markus |website=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12{{Nbsp}}September 2018, an updated position of the parliament was approved with the final vote being 438{{Nbsp}}in favour and 226{{Nbsp}}against,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved|title=EU approves controversial Copyright Directive, including internet ‘link tax’ and ‘upload filter’|date=12 September 2018|last=Vincent|first=James|website=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that [[Formal Trilogue meeting|trilogue negotiations]] can start between the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Parliament]], with an expected conclusion in early 2019. Should the three groups agree to the final language, then the directive will be sent to governments of the 28 member states to be passed as laws within those countries, with each country formalising certain processes as necessary to meet their existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/european-parliament-approves-copyright-bill-slammed-by-digital-rights-groups/ | title=  What’s in the sweeping copyright bill just passed by the European Parliament | first=  Timothy | last=  Lee | date = 12 September 2018 | accessdate = 12 September 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 3 ===

Article 3 proposes a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|copyright exception]] for [[text and data mining]] (TDM) for the purposes of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=9 June 2018|title=Copyright Reform: Help Us Ensure an Effective TDM Exception! – LIBER|url=https://libereurope.eu/blog/2017/09/25/copyright-reform-help-us-ensure-an-effective-tdm-exception/|newspaper=LIBER|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COREPER version has both a mandatory and an optional extension.&lt;ref name ="consilium_europa01"/&gt;

Depending on whether it acknowledges the [[public domain]] status of facts and information, the TDM exception could increase or decrease restrictions compared to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=12 June 2018|title=24 organisations urge Rapporteur Axel Voss MEP to strike a more ambitious deal on TDM – European Alliance for Research Excellence|url=http://eare.eu/24-organisations-urge-rapporteur-voss-reach-ambitious-deal-tdm/|newspaper=European Alliance for Research Excellence|date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 4 ===

Article 4 proposes a mandatory exception for the use of copyrighted works as part of "digital and cross-border teaching activities". This article, when implemented, would clarify that educational establishments can make non-commercial use of copyrighted works for illustrative purposes.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

There have been worries from the educational sector that the exception proposed in article 4 is too limiting. For example, the sector proposes to broaden the scope of "educational establishments" to include cultural heritage institutions. The most debated part of the article is 4(2), under which the exception would not be available if there are "adequate licenses" available in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.okfn.org/educators-ask-for-a-better-copyright/|title=Educators ask for a better copyright|date=16 January 2018|work=Open Education Working Group|access-date=5 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COREPER version has changes to reflect the arguments of the education sector, but still includes the debated article 4(2).{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Article 11 ===

Article 11 extends the 2001 [[Copyright Directive]] to grant publishers direct copyright over "online use of their press publications by information society service providers".&lt;ref name="EUJune25" /&gt; Under current EU law, publishers instead rely on authors assigning copyright to them and must prove rights ownership for each individual work.&lt;ref name="EPstudy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=IPOL_STU(2017)596810|title=Strengthening the Position of Press Publishers and Authors and Performers in the Copyright Directive – Think Tank|publisher=European Parliament|access-date=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal attaches several new conditions to the right, including expiry after one year and exemptions for either copying an "insubstantial" part of a work or for copying it in the course of academic or scientific research.&lt;ref name="EUJune25" /&gt; It is derived from the [[ancillary copyright for press publishers]] which was introduced in Germany in 2013.&lt;ref name="EPstudy" /&gt; Press publishing, "whose purpose is to inform the general public and which are periodically or regularly updated", is distinguished from [[academic publishing|academic]] and [[Scientific literature|scientific]] publishing (Recital 33).&lt;ref name ="consilium_europa01"/&gt;

In their explanatory memorandum, the Council describe existing rights enforcement for online use of press publications as "complex and inefficient" and draw particular attention toward the use of news articles by "news aggregators or media monitoring services" for commercial purposes, and the problems faced by press publishers in licensing their work for such services.&lt;ref name ="consilium_europa01"/&gt; A study commissioned by the European Commission, which analysed the implementation of similar laws in Germany and Spain (with the latter having, notably, resulted in discontinuation of [[Google News]] in that country), found that newspapers actually benefited from the increased exposure (and in turn, ad revenue from traffic) that news aggregation platforms attracted to their online articles, noting that "the German and Spanish cases show that the law can create a right", but that "market forces have valued this right at a zero price".&lt;ref name="ECstudy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/4776/response/15356/attach/6/Doc1.pdf|title=Online News Aggregation and Neighbouring Rights for News Publishers|id=Ref.

The version of the directive voted on by [[European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs]] contained explicit exemptions for the act of [[hyperlinking]] and "legitimate private and non-commercial use of press publications by individual users".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://juliareda.eu/2018/06/article-11-13-vote/|title=What’s at stake in the July 5 #SaveYourInternet vote: The text, explained|last=Reda|first=Julia|work=Julia Reda|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 12a ===
Article 12a proposes granting sports event organisers copyright over recordings of their events.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P8-TA-2018-0337|title=Amendments adopted by the European Parliament on 12 September 2018 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright in the Digital Single Market|last=|first=|date=12 September 2018|website=|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 13 ===

Article 13 replaces the "[[Electronic Commerce Directive 2000|mere conduit]]" exemption from copyright infringement from for-profit "[[User-generated content|online content sharing service]] providers" with a new, conditional exemption to liability. These conditions are the implementation of "effective and proportionate measures" to "prevent the availability of specific [unlicensed] works identified by rightsholders", acting "expeditiously" to remove them, and demonstrating that "best efforts" have been made to "[[Notice and stay down|prevent their future availability]]". The article also extends any licenses granted to content hosts to their users, as long as those users are not acting "on a commercial basis".&lt;ref name="consilium_europa01" /&gt;

The article directs member states to consider the size of the provider, the amount of content uploaded, and the effectiveness of the measures imposed "in light of technological developments". It also mandates an appeals process,&lt;ref name="consilium_europa01" /&gt; and requires content hosts to share "information on the use of content" with its owners, the lack of which has been a point of contention in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/internet/03youtube.html|title=Royalty Dispute Stops Music Videos in Germany|last=O’Brien|first=Kevin J.|date=|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 13 has faced widespread criticism over the possibility that it could create a [[chilling effect]] on online expression. Although the article requires only "best efforts" from providers, it is widely accepted by critics and proponents alike that in order to meet the requirement of preventing future availability, larger companies would need to implement content matching technology similar to [[YouTube]]'s [[Content ID (algorithm)|Content ID]] system.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2018Meme"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44546620|title='Disastrous' copyright bill vote approved|last=|first=|date=20 June 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics emphasise the issue of [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]] within such systems, and their inability to account for copyright limitations such as [[fair dealing]] (leading, they allege, to a "[[Internet meme|meme]] ban").&lt;ref name="CNET2018June22"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/article-13-europes-hotly-debated-eu-copyright-law-explained/|title=Everything you need to know about Europe's new meme-ending war|date=22 June 2018|accessdate=1 July 2018|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters and third parties point out that YouTube has used Content ID for a decade and yet remains a successful host for content of all kinds.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/censorship-machines-are-destroying-the-internet-as-we-speak-180624/|title=Censorship Machines are 'Destroying The Internet' As We Speak?|last=|first=|date=2018-06-24|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet YouTube CEO expressed concerns the new legislation could shut down the ability of millions of people to upload to YouTube.&lt;ref name="YouTubeCreatorBlog"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2018/10/a-final-update-on-our-priorities-for.html|title=A Final Update on Our Priorities for 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-10-22|work=YouTube Creator Blog|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other claims from critics include suggestions that all content providers will be forced to use expensive content filters, that only major U.S. technology firms had sufficient resources to develop such systems,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/eu/2018/06/19/the-eus-disastrous-copyright-reform-explained/|title=The EU's disastrous Copyright Reform, explained by its lovers and haters|last=Maack|first=Már Másson|date=19 June 2018|work=The Next Web|access-date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that outsourcing the task has privacy implications.&lt;ref name="Rom20182"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romero-Moreno|first1=Felipe|date=29 May 2018|title=‘Notice and staydown’ and social media: amending Article 13 of the Proposed Directive on Copyright|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/13600869.2018.1475906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coverage ====
Article 13's provisions target commercial web hosts which "store and give the public access to a large amount of works or other subject-matter uploaded by its users which [they] organise and promote for profit-making purposes". The proposal makes explicit that this does not include private [[cloud storage]] services, non-profit encyclopedias (such as [[Wikipedia]]), non-profit educational or scientific repositories, nor a variety of other cases.&lt;ref name="consilium_europa01" /&gt;

The article's provisions do not apply to all commercial content hosts equally. The proposal explains that "[small and micro enterprises] should only be expected to expeditiously remove specific unauthorised works and other subject matter upon notification by {{Sic|rightholders}}", and that "different measures may be appropriate and proportionate per type of content" &lt;ref name="consilium_europa01" /&gt;.  "Small" and "micro" are defined in Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC; {{As of|2018|June}}, this covers businesses with less than 50{{Nbsp}}employees and less than 10{{Nbsp}}million on their annual turnover or annual balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-05-20|title=Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 1422)|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2003/361/oj/eng|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 13b ===
Article 13b requires websites which "automatically reproduce or refer to significant amounts of copyright-protected visual works" to "conclude fair and balanced licensing agreements with any requesting rightholders".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Article 15 ===

Article 15 aims to allow authors to increase their remuneration in some cases where it is disproportionately low. The proposed articles 14–16, while weaker than systems existing in many member states, would improve the bargaining position of authors and performers.&lt;ref name=EPstudy/&gt;

Associations of authors had proposed a "rights reversion mechanism" which would allow cancelling a [[copyright transfer agreement]] proven to be disadvantageous.&lt;ref name="basca01" &gt;{{cite web |title=Music creators call for EU-wide rights reversion mechanism |url=https://basca.org.uk/2017/10/19/music-creators-call-eu-wide-rights-reversion-mechanism/|website=BASCA|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofauthors.org/SOA/MediaLibrary/SOAWebsite/Submissions/20170811-ALCS-and-SoA-Briefing-note-on-DSM-directive-and-Juri-amendments.pdf|title=Our Views on the European Commission's Draft Legislation to Modernise the European Copyright Framework and Proposed Amendments|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other articles ===

Other passages of the proposal attempt to clarify the legal status of certain common activities by libraries and of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=22 June 2018|title=European Parliament votes to improve access to digitised cultural heritage |url=https://pro.europeana.eu/post/european-parliament-votes-to-improve-access-to-digitsed-cultural-heritage|website=Europeana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments approved by some [[European Parliament]] committees would address issues with the [[public domain]] and [[freedom of panorama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-37/synopsis_report_-_panorama_exception_-_final_17049.pdf|title=Synopsis report on the 'panorama exception'|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support in the European Parliament is led by the directive's [[rapporteur]], [[Axel Voss]], a member of the European Parliament for Germany and a member of the [[European People's Party group]], another proponent of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/news/Axel-Voss-appointed-new-Rapporteur-for-Copyright-Directive|title=Axel Voss appointed new Rapporteur for Copyright Directive|last=|first=|date=2017-06-15|work=eppgroup.eu|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political supporters at a national level include the United Kingdom [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/the-industry-is-totally-united-on-this-issue-uk-music-leads-copyright-delegation-to-brussels/072965|title='The industry is totally united on this issue': UK Music leads copyright delegation to Brussels|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voss rejects critics' arguments against the directive, and in particular describes talk of censorship as "unjustified, excessive, objectively wrong and dishonest".

Newspapers in open support of the directive pejoratively label some of those opposed as "the largest, richest corporate entities in the world".

A group of nine major European press publishers including [[Agence France-Presse]], the [[Press Association]], and the [[European Alliance of News Agencies]] issued a letter strongly supporting the proposal, describing it as "key for the media industry, the consumer’s future access to news, and ultimately a healthy democracy". In the letter, they cite existing state support for struggling news media and argue that it should instead be provided by the "internet giants" which have been "siphoning off" advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="9agencies"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://images.derstandard.at/2017/12/14/brief.pdf|title=Letter by 9 news agencies|last=|first=|date=2017-12-14|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the European member states, observers believed that Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium and Hungary had voiced opposition to the directive as introduced in May 2018 with the language for Articles 11 and 13, though the votes themselves are not part of public record. Under European law, a proposal can be blocked by the minority if this minority includes 13 member states or represents more than 35% of the EU's population; the opposing states in May 2018 only amounted to about 25% of the population and thus could not block the Directive. Since then, Italy has issued its statements critical of Articles 11 and 13; Italy's 11% of the EU's population would be sufficient to block any proposal should such a vote happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/italy-steps-defend-eu-internet-users-against-copyright-filters-who-will-be-next | title = Italy Steps Up To Defend EU Internet Users Against Copyright Filters – Who Will Be Next? | first=  Danny | last = O'Brein | date = 23 October 2018| accessdate = 23 October 2018 | work = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]], the owner of video-sharing website, [[YouTube]], has opposed the directive since its first inception in 2016, when they argued that the proposals would "turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/european-copyright-theres-better-way/|title=European copyright: there's a better way|date=2016-09-14|work=Google|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the company encouraged news publishers in its [[Digital News Initiative]], members of which are eligible for grants from a €150m fund, to lobby MEPs on the proposals.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a8031d7a-78a0-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d|title=Google criticised for push against EU copyright reform|last=|first=|date=26 June 2018|website=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube's chief executive officer, [[Susan Wojcicki]], urged content creators on the platform to take action to oppose the legislation, as it "poses a threat to both [their] livelihood and [their] ability to share [their] voice with the world", and stressing that their [[ContentID]] system was intended to help assure fair management and payments for copyright holders already without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/youtube-susan-wojcicki-creators-protest-eu-article-13-copyright-law.html | title = YouTube CEO urges YouTube creators to protest European copyright law | first = Julianne| last = D'onfo | date = 22 October 2018 | accessdate = 23 October 2018 | work = [[CNBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wojcicki later wrote that any company implementing the necessary protocols to meet the directive would be a significant financial burden, and for a company the scale of YouTube, "the potential liabilities could be so large that no company could take on such a financial risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/12/18087250/youtube-ceo-copyright-directive-article-13-european-union | title = YouTube CEO calls EU’s proposed copyright regulation financially impossible | first = Julie | last= Alexander | date = 12 November 2018 | accessdate = 12 November 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facebook]] is also opposed, arguing that the proposal "could have serious, unintended consequences for an open and creative internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/european-parliament-votes-against-publishers-right-copyright-law-changes-as-facebook-warns-of-unintended-consequences/|title=European Parliament votes against ‘publisher’s right’ copyright law changes as Facebook warns of ‘unintended consequences’|last=|first=|date=2018-07-05|website=|publisher=Press Gazette|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigners criticise Article 11 as a "[[link tax]]" which would require website publishers "to obtain a license before linking to news stories",&lt;ref name="effdeeplinks"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/crucial-next-few-days-eus-copyright-filter-and-link-tax-battle|title=The Crucial Next Few Days In the EU's Copyright Filter and Link Tax Battle|last=O&amp;#039;Brien|first=Danny|date=29 June 2018|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=4 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 13 as a "[[Internet meme|meme]] ban", on the basis that the content-matching technologies employed to meet its requirements cannot identify [[fair dealing]] such as [[parody]].&lt;ref name="BBC2018Meme" /&gt; 

Other campaigners, like the [[Copyright for Creativity]] coalition, claim the duration of copyright is too long, the proposals are outdated, create no harmonisation and a dysfunctional implementation and enforcement of the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copyright4creativity.eu/2015/01/19/c4ccopyrightmanifesto/ |title=The Copyright Manifesto |publisher=Consensus Optimus, Nicholai Hart Ashton Hart, France |access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic criticism has instead emphasised concern about the effectiveness of Article 11's impact on the readership of online publication and of Article 13's obligations on service providers that will "benefit big players".&lt;ref name="Create20180629" /&gt; Individuals who have publicly opposed the law include comedian [[Stephen Fry]]; author [[Neil Gaiman]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/pro/paul-mccartney-joins-celeb-lobbying-european-parliament-over-copyright-reform-vote/|title=Paul McCartney joins crowded fight over online rules|last=|first=|date=4 July 2018|website=|publisher=[[Politico]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Berners-Lee]], creator of the [[World Wide Web]]; [[Vint Cerf]], co-inventor of the [[Internet protocol suite]]; and [[Jimmy Wales]], co-founder of Wikipedia; who raise concerns regarding the costs and effectiveness of upload filters and the negative effects on [[free speech]] online.&lt;ref name="BBC2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44482381|title=Protests over Brussels copyright reform|date=15 June 2018|work=''BBC News''|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Reporters Without Borders]] were among signatories of an open letter opposing article 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copybuzz.com/copyright/50-human-rights-media-freedom-ngos-ask-eu-delete-censorship-filter-stop-madness/|title=Over 50 Human Rights &amp; Media Freedom NGOs ask EU to Delete Censorship Filter &amp; to Stop © Madness – Copybuzz|website=copybuzz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition|SPARC Europe]] called for the removal of Article 11, arguing that it would "make the last two decades of news less accessible to researchers and the public, leading to a distortion of the public's knowledge and memory of past events", and if extended to academic publishing, would "in effect ask readers to pay publishers for access to works for which authors, institutions or research funders had already paid publishers to make freely accessible to all under '[[open access]]' terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sparceurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CopyrightReformBrief.pdf|title="Copyright in the Digital Single Market" briefing|publisher=SPARC Europe|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Create20180629"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Academic_Statement_Copyright_Directive_29_06_2018.pdf|title=Copyright Reform: Open Letter from European Research Centres|last=|first=|date=29 June 2018|website=|work=CREATe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic publishing ===
The proposal is generally supported by academic publishers including the [[International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers]].&lt;ref name="Nature2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiermeier|first1=Quirin|date=5 April 2018|title=EU copyright reforms draw fire from scientists|journal=Nature|volume=556|issue=7699|pages=14–15|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-03837-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group has nevertheless criticised the proposal for excluding scientific publishers from the provisions of Article 11, describing the exclusion as "unwarranted and potentially discriminatory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stm-assoc.org/2016_09_14_News_Release_STM_response_to_Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Single_Digital_Market.pdf|title=STM response to Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market|last=|first=|date=2016-09-14|website=|publisher=[[International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers|STM]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eurodoc|European Council for Doctoral Candidates and Junior Researchers]] opposes the proposal on the grounds that Article 13's exemption for non-commercial groups does not cover all scientific repositories, and cites the [[Horizon 2020]] project as an example of commercial work in the sector. They also generally agree with the claims of other opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurodoc.net/eurodoc-open-letter-copyright-directive.pdf|title=Eurodoc Open Letter to European Parliament on Copyright Directive|date=2 July 2018|website=[[Eurodoc]]|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]], an [[open access]] advocacy group, opposes the proposal in principle.&lt;ref name="Nature2018" /&gt;

=== Case law ===
In 2012, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that existing EU law "must be interpreted as precluding a national court from issuing an injunction against a hosting service provider which requires it to install a system for filtering...with a view to preventing works from being made available to the public in breach of copyright", arguing that such an injunction "could potentially undermine freedom of information, since that system might not distinguish adequately between unlawful content and lawful content, with the result that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=119512doclang=EN&amp;cid=2283803|title=Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten en Uitgevers CVBA (SABAM) v Netlog NV|last=|first=|date=16 February 2012|website=[[CURIA]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view can be seen in Case C-160/15 ''GS Media BV v Sanoma Media Netherlands BV, Playboy &amp; Britt Geertruida Dekker'' and in Case C-70/10 ''Scarlet Extended SA v SABAM, BEA Video, BEA Music &amp; ISPA''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Human rights ===
The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] raised concerns that the proposal was incompatible with the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In a public letter, special rapporteur, [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], argued that the proposal's reluctance to pin down precise obligations on content hosts created "significant legal uncertainty" inconsistent with the covenant's requirement that any restrictions on freedom of expression be "provided by law". He concluded that this could lead to "pressure on content sharing providers to err on the side of caution". Kaye also criticised the lack of "prior judicial review" inherent in the system, and the similarly extrajudicial nature of its appeals process.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Opinion/Legislation/OL-OTH-41-2018.pdf|title=European Union draft directive on copyright in the digital single market|author=Kaye|first=David|date=13 June 2018|website=|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UNHCHR]]|id=OL OTH 41/2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter also raised concerns regarding the lack of protection for non-profit groups, although such groups had been excluded from the proposal's provisions prior to its publication.&lt;ref name="consilium_europa01" /&gt; The EU was invited to respond within 60{{Nbsp}}days.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Douglas Daniel Clark''' (born March 10, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]].&lt;ref name=Levin05&gt;{{cite book|author = James Alan Fox, Jack Levin|year = 2005|title = Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=txPYzY1_HLQC|pages = 79–81|publisher = SAGE|isbn = 0761988572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark and his accomplice, [[Carol M. Bundy]], were collectively known as the '''Sunset Strip Killers'''. They were accused and subsequently convicted of a series of murders in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

== Biography ==
Doug Clark was the son of Franklin Clark, a [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] officer.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved frequently during Clark's childhood due to his father's job, and he later claimed to have lived in 37 different countries. In 1958, his father left the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for a civilian position as an engineer with the Transport Company of Texas, but the family still moved around.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 40"/&gt; They lived in the [[Marshall Islands]] for a time, moved back to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and then moved again to [[India]]. Clark was sent to an exclusive international school in [[Geneva]] and later attended [[Culver Military Academy]] while his father continued to move around the world. When he graduated in 1967, Clark enlisted in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 40"/&gt;

Clark was eventually discharged from the Air Force and he [[Vagrant|drifted]] around for the next decade, often working as a mechanic.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 40"/&gt; He moved to [[Los Angeles]] and was employed as a steam plant operator for the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]], working at the Valley Generating Station, before abruptly quitting. Subsequently, Clark became a boiler operator at the [[Jergens]] soap factory in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], but was fired due to a high rate of absence and violent threats he had made against his coworkers. One of the bars he frequented in the area was called Little Nashville, where he met [[Carol M. Bundy]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 40"/&gt; He soon moved in with her and learned they shared dark sexual fantasies.

== Murders ==
Clark started bringing [[prostitution|prostitutes]] back to the couple's apartment to have [[threesome]]s. Then, when Clark took an interest in an 11-year-old neighbor, Bundy helped lure the girl into posing for [[child pornography|pornographic photographs]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark quickly escalated from [[pedophilia]], talking about how much he would like to kill a girl during sex. He persuaded Bundy to purchase two automatic pistols for him to use, reportedly seeking to fulfill his fantasy of killing a woman during sex and feeling her [[vagina]]l contractions during the death spasms.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=James Alan|title=Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder|year=2005|publisher=SAGE.|isbn=0761988572|pages=79–81|author2=Jack Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One night, during June 1980, Clark came home and told Bundy about two teenagers, Gina Marano and Cynthia Chandler, whom he had murdered after picking them up on the [[Sunset Strip]]. He had ordered them to perform [[fellatio]] on him and then shot them both in the head before taking them to a garage and [[necrophilia|raping their dead bodies]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 41"/&gt; He had then dumped the bodies near the [[Ventura Freeway]], where they were found the next day. An uneasy Bundy phoned the police, admitting to having some knowledge of the murders, but refused to provide any clues as to Clark's identity.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 41"/&gt; Clark told Bundy that, if either of them were apprehended, he would take the blame in the hope that she would be allowed to go free.&lt;ref name=Schmid06&gt;{{cite book|author = Schmid, David|year = 2006|title = Natural Born Celebrities: Serial Killers in American Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a_GwiSGfZFoC|pages = 232|publisher = University of Chicago Press|isbn = 0226738698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doug Clark unidentified victim.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of Clark's unidentified victim, found in 1980.]]

Twelve days after the initial murders, Clark killed two [[prostitute]]s, Karen Jones and Exxie Wilson. Like before, Clark lured them into the car, shot them, and dumped their bodies in plain sight, but not before removing Wilson's head.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark took the head back home and stored it in the refrigerator. Bundy, upon seeing it, put make-up on it before Clark used it again for another "bout of necrophilia."&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt; Two days later, the couple put the freshly cleaned head in a box and dumped it in an alleyway. Three days later, another victim was found in the woods in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. The victim was a runaway named Marnette Comer, who appeared to have been killed three weeks earlier, making it Clark's first known victim.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Bundy attended country music performances by Jack Murray, her former apartment manager and lover. After one such performance, Bundy conversed with Murray and drunkenly talked about the things she and Clark were doing. Murray was alarmed and implied that he might tell the police. To prevent this from happening, in August 1980, Bundy lured Murray into his van after a show to have sex. Once they were inside, she shot and [[decapitation|decapitated]] him.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt; However, Bundy left various clues behind, including shell casings in the van.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt; Two days later, Bundy bowed to psychological pressure and confessed to her co-workers that she had killed Murray. They called the police and she gave a full confession to her and Clark's crimes.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt;

Clark is believed to have murdered an [[Newhall Jane Doe|unidentified youth]] who was discovered on August 26, 1980 in [[Newhall, California]]. The victim had been shot in the head and was found wearing only a red sweatshirt. Her face was reconstructed by the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] in efforts to identify her, as her remains were unrecognizable due to skeletonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People vs. Clark|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/3C4t41.htm|website=3online.ceb.com|publisher=Los Angeles County Sheriff Department|accessdate=4 November 2014|date=30 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest and conviction ==
The murder weapons were found hidden at Clark's work-place upon his arrest. Bundy was charged with two murders: Murray and the unknown victim whose killing she confessed to having been present at.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt; Clark was charged with six murders. At his trial, he [[Pro se|acted as his own defense counsel]] and tried to blame Bundy for everything, claiming he had been manipulated. The jury did not believe him and he was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] in 1983. He remains on California's [[death row]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2005|title = Douglas Daniel Clark |publisher = Bookrags|url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/douglas-daniel-clark-cri/|accessdate = 2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy, on the other hand, made a [[plea bargain]] and in return for her testimony was sentenced to fifty-two-years-to-[[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt; Bundy died in prison from heart failure on December 9, 2003, at the age of 61.&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 42"/&gt;

However, some doubt has been cast on the nature of Clark's conviction. [[Criminologist]] Christopher Berry-Dee has contested that Clark could actually provide [[alibi]]s for five of the seven murders he was convicted of, and that the presiding judge refused to accept key physical evidence, including a witness and several banking documents that exonerated Clark in Wilson's murder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Talking With Serial Killers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = John Blake|year = 2003|isbn = 978 1 90403 453 7|location = London, England.|pages = 263–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundy's testimony was proven to be highly inconsistent; she claimed at first that Clark had murdered "Jane Doe 18" two weeks before her interview on August 11 without her involvement or knowledge. When she was told that Clark had an alibi for that date, she was allowed to change her story, and subsequently provided intricate details on the manner of the murder and location of the body, even though she had initially claimed to know nothing about it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bundy also admitted that police allowed her to withdraw $3000 from Murray's bank account, although she claimed the police took the money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With an almost total lack of physical evidence, Bundy's testimony formed the entire basis of Clark's conviction. Additionally, Clark's lawyer was drunk during most of the trial, and fell asleep several times while he was being [[cross-examination|cross-examined]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, Clark requested to defend himself. He was denied co-counsel, advisory counsel and the services of a law clerk, with the judge improperly telling him to "go it alone."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Cockfighter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cockerel that appears to have been dubbed]]
'''Dubbing''' is the procedure of removing the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] and sometimes earlobes of [[poultry]]. Removing the wattles is sometimes called "dewattling".

==Procedure==
To perform dubbing, the tissues are first disinfected and, if available, an [[anesthetic]] is applied to limit pain. Sterile scissors or dubbing shears are used to cut the tissues off, and a [[styptic]], an [[astringent]] chemical that reduces bleeding, is applied. The wounds are left uncovered. Some recommend dubbing should be done on day old chicks whilst others advise waiting until the bird’s comb is more developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shahbazinanatolianshepherds.com/dubbing.htm|title=Dubbing by Jennifer A. Floyd|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405112642/http://www.shahbazinanatolianshepherds.com/dubbing.htm|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/cajunyankee/dubbing.htm|title=Dubbing Poultry on freewebs|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115143751/http://www.freewebs.com/cajunyankee/dubbing.htm|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Dubbing is sometimes performed to limit damage caused by injury or [[frostbite]]. Dubbing for some breeds has become a tradition and is required for some birds to meet breed-specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/3885370/Just-a-trim-but-SPCA-inspector-objects|title=Report in The Nelson Mail by Alice Cowdrey|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include removing combs which have become so large they prevent the bird from taking food into its mouth or making the head so heavy it sinks into the bird's chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theleghornclub.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=problems&amp;thread=50&amp;page=1|title=Leghorn club forum comments on dubbing|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the US, the [[National Chicken Council]] (2003) listed dubbing of cockerels as one of the acceptable procedures that may cause short-term stress but which are necessary for the long-term welfare of the flock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalchickencouncil.com/files/NCCanimalWelfare.pdf|title=National Chicken Council view on dubbing|accessdate=9 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505134845/http://www.nationalchickencouncil.com/files/NCCanimalWelfare.pdf#|archive-date=2018-05-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbing is also performed to prevent injuries from other birds or while being kept in pens.

==Criticism==
In practice, an anesthetic is rarely used during dubbing and as a consequence, the [[RSPCA Australia]] is opposed to dubbing on poultry intended to be exhibited at shows, and describes the practice as a cause of pain and distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-RSPCAs-view-on-dubbing-poultry-for-show-purposes_297.html|title=RSPCA view on dubbing|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comb and wattles function in [[thermoregulation]]; [[blood]] circulating from the comb and the wattles helps the bird lose heat during hot weather. The comb is also used in mate-assessment in some poultry species.&lt;ref name="Jones and Prescott, (2000)"&gt;Jones, E.K.M. and Prescott, N.B., (2000). Visual cues used in the choice of mate by fowl and their potential importance for the breeder industry. World's Poultry Science Journal, 56: 127-138. {{doi|10.1079/WPS20000010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbing would interfere with both these functions of the comb and wattles.

In commercial laying hens, those dubbed at hatching exhibit few effects on egg production but the older the birds are when dubbed, the greater the negative effects of dubbing.&lt;ref name="Fairfull et al., (1985)"&gt;Fairfull, R.W., Crober, D.C. and Gowe, R.S., (1985). Effects of comb dubbing on the performance of laying stocks. Poultry Science, 64: 434–439. {{doi|10.3382/ps.0640434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] (FAWC) concludes "that removal of the comb offers no welfare advantages to offset the disturbance caused by the procedure and believe the practice should be phased out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb3907/broil028.htm|title=FAWC report on broiler breeds|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617154058/http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb3907/broil028.htm|archivedate=17 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra) writes: "Removal of the comb offers few, if any, welfare advantages in comparison with the disturbance and pain likely to be caused and should be avoided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?id=000IL3890W.182NF3V0DMMFGX|title=DEFRA statement on dubbing|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons|Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966]] (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1988 (SI 1988 No. 526) permits only a veterinary surgeon to remove the combs of a domestic fowl which has reached the age of 72 hours.

In [[New Zealand]], the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee stated in 2002 they were "working towards a strategy to prevent this practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/files/regs/animal-welfare/pubs/nawac/nawac-ar-01.pdf|title=NAWAC statement on dubbing|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) reviewed scientific evidence and concluded "that no mutilation with an effect on welfare as severe as those resulting from cutting off toes or dubbing the comb should be carried out unless justified by evidence for a substantial and unavoidable level of poor welfare in the birds themselves and other birds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1667|title=EFSA (2010). Scientific opinion on welfare aspects of the management and housing of the grandparent and parent stocks raised and kept for breeding purposes. |journal=EFSA Journal|volume= 8|issue=7|pages=1667|DOI=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1667|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''eMachines''' was a brand of low-end [[personal computer]]s. In 2004, it was acquired by [[Gateway, Inc.]], which was in turn acquired by [[Acer Inc.]] in 2007. The eMachines brand was discontinued in 2013.

==History==
eMachines was founded in September 1998 by [[Lap Shun Hui]] as a [[joint venture]] of South Korean companies Korea Data Systems and [[TriGem]].&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/31/business/emachines-is-fourth-in-us-sales-of-pc-s.html | title=Emachines Is Fourth in U.S. Sales of PC's | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 31, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sold PCs at prices of $399 or $499, all without a monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/29/emachines.idg/index.html | title=Emachines readies sub-$500 PCs | first=Ephraim | last=Schwartz | work=[[CNN]] | date=September 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1999, the company was ranked 4th in U.S. computer sales, with a 9.9% [[market share]].&lt;ref name=fourth/&gt;

In August 1999, the company released the [[eOne]], a computer that resembled the [[iMac]], priced at $799, with a $400 [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] for customers who signed a 3-year agreement with [[CompuServe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/emachines-imac-like-pc-ships-this-week/ | title=eMachines' iMac-like PC ships this week | first=Margaret | last=Kane | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=August 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, the company announced plans to launch an [[internet service provider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/emachines-net-not-just-another-isp/ | title=eMachines.net not just another ISP | first=John G. | last=Spooner | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=September 10, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, the company acquired Free-PC, which had previously given away free computers in exchange for advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/30/business/fi-38943 | title=Low-Cost PC Maker EMachines in Deal to Acquire Free-PC | first=JONATHAN | last=GAW | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=November 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, at the peak of the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], raising $180 million. By that time, the company had sold 2 million computers, but had lost $84.5 million in the previous year on $815 million in sales and a 4% [[profit margin]]. Shares fell 8% in their debut. At that time, major shareholders included [[AOL]] with a 6.4% stake and [[Bill T. Gross]] with a 12.4% stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/25/business/fi-12413 | title=EMachines' IPO Takes 8% Dip in the Market | first=ROBIN | last=FIELDS | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2001, the stock was trading at 38 cents per share and the company was delisted from the [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/25/business/fi-2405 | title=Irvine's EMachines Booted From Nasdaq | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, Lap Shun Hui, the founder of the company, acquired the company for $161 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/01/business/fi-emach1 | title=EMachines Founder Buys Shares | first=James S. | last=Granelli | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, the company released the T6000 desktop, the world's first mass-marketed [[AMD]] [[Athlon 64]]-based system, retailing at US$1,299. The systems were primarily sold through [[Best Buy]] stores, but the PCs were also available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.geek.com/blurb/emachines-selling-loaded-athlon-64-system-551426/ | title=eMachines selling loaded Athlon 64 system | work=[[Geek.com]] | date=December 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, the company was the first to sell notebooks based on the AMD Mobile Athlon 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040119005104/en/eMachines-Introduces-64-Bit-Wireless-Widescreen-Notebook-Line | title=eMachines Introduces 64-Bit Wireless Widescreen Notebook Line; Company Is First Major PC Brand to Incorporate Mobile AMD Athlon 64 Processor for Mobile Computing | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=January 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, the company was acquired by Gateway Inc. for 50 million shares of Gateway common stock and $30 million cash. [[Wayne Inouye]], CEO of eMachines, became CEO of Gateway, replacing founder [[Ted Waitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070918006505/en/Gateway-Completes-Acquisition-eMachines | title=Gateway Completes Acquisition of eMachines | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=March 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Acer Inc. acquired Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101100822.html | title=Acer completes Gateway share purchase | first=Dan | last=Nystedt | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the eMachines brand was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2026208/acer-sheds-emachines-turns-to-gateway-and-packard-bell-for-post-pc-era.html | title=Acer sheds eMachines, turns to Gateway and Packard Bell for post-PC era | first=Agam | last=Shah | work=[[PCWorld]] | date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">{{Criminology and penology|theory}}

'''Environmental criminology''' focuses on criminal patterns within particular [[built environment]]s and analyzes the impacts of these external variables on people's [[cognitive behavior]]. It forms a part of [[criminology]]'s [[Positivist school|Positivist School]] in that it applies the [[scientific method]] to examine the [[society]] that &lt;!--POV?:--&gt;causes crime.

== Theory ==

Environmental criminology is the study of crime, criminality, and [[Victimology|victimization]] as they relate, first, to particular places, and secondly, to the way that individuals and organizations shape their activities spatially, and in so doing are in turn influenced by place-based or spatial factors.  

The environmental criminology approach was developed in the 1980s by Paul and Patricia Brantingham, putting focus of criminological study on environmental or context factors that can influence criminal activity.  These include space (geography), time, law, offender, and target or victim. These five components are a necessary and sufficient condition, for without one, the other four, even together, will not constitute a criminal incident (Brantingham &amp; Brantingham: 1991). Despite the obvious multi-faceted nature of crime, scholars and practitioners often attempt to study them separately. For instance, lawyers and political scientists focus on the legal dimension; sociologists, psychologists and civil rights groups generally look to the offenders and victims, while geographers concentrate upon the location of the event. Environmental criminologists examine the place and the time when the crime happened. They are interested in land usage, traffic patterns and street design, and the daily activities and movements of victims and offenders. Environmental criminologists often use maps to look for crime patterns, for example, using metric topology. (Verma &amp; Lodha: 2002)

== Practical applications ==

The study of the spatial patterns of crime and criminality has a long history.  In the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], [[Robert E. Park|Robert Ezra Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]], and other [[Urban sociology|urban sociologists]] developed the [[Concentric ring model|concentric zones]] model, and considered geographic factors in study of [[juvenile delinquency]].  

Geography was also considered in law enforcement, through use of large pin maps to show where crime incidents occurred.  Mapping and analysis of crime is now entering a new phase with the use of computerized [[crime mapping]] systems by the police and researchers, with environmental criminology theories playing an important part in how crime patterns are understood.  Other practical applications of environmental criminology theory include [[geographic profiling]], which is premised on the idea that criminals take into account geographic factors in deciding where to commit crimes. (Bartol and Bartol, 2006)

[[Crime prevention through environmental design]] (CPTED) is another practical application, based on the idea that situational factors such as the environment (poor lighting) can make crime more likely to occur at a particular time and place.  CPTED measures to reduce the likelihood can include added lighting, making the place less conducive for crime.

Concentrated areas of high level of crime, known as crime hot spots, may have situational factors that help explain why the particular place is a problem.  Could be that the place is poorly supervised, has poor "place management", has poor lighting or other characteristics.  Changing some of those situational factors may help reduce levels of crime in that place.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 2012''' was the 57th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], following [[Ell&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Nikki]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 contest]] in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]] with the song "[[Running Scared (Eldar &amp; Nigar song)|Running Scared]]" — marking the first time that the country had won the contest. The contest was held at the newly constructed [[Baku Crystal Hall]], with semi-finals held on 22 and 24 May 2012, followed by the final held on 26 May 2012. Forty-two countries competed in the contest — one less than the record number of 43 set at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|the previous contest]], with [[Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Montenegro]] returning for the first time since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], and the withdrawal of [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenia]] due to security concerns in relation to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] with Azerbaijan, and [[Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Poland]] due to financial concerns.

The contest was won by singer [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] from [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] with the song "[[Euphoria (Loreen song)|Euphoria]]" — written by [[Thomas G:son]] and [[Peter Boström]], the song scored a total of 372 points. [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Russia]] finished in second place, with [[Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Serbia]] finishing in third. They were followed by the host country, [[Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Azerbaijan]], which reached the 4th place. [[Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Albania]] finished 5th, achieving its first top 5 placing. [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Germany]], [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Italy]] and [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Spain]] were the three members of the "Big Five" that managed to rank within the top 10, finishing in 8th, 9th and 10th places respectively.

The lead-up to the contest was met with political concerns and protests surrounding the host country, including its [[human rights]] record and allegations by advocacy groups that Baku was carrying out forced [[eviction]]s in the construction of the contest's venue, along with objections to the contest's presence by [[Iran]]ian officials—who felt that the event was anti-Islamic because it was, according to them, a "[[gay pride parade|gay parade]]".

[[Azerbaijan]] got the right to host the 2012 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest after winning the previous [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 edition]] with the song "[[Running Scared (Eldar &amp; Nigar song)|Running Scared]]" performed by [[Ell&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Nikki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan's Eurovision rebirth|url=http://www.news.com.au/azerbaijans-eurovision-rebirth/story-fn7mjoe2-1226056434332|publisher=news.com.au|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan win Eurovision Song Contest 2011|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a319549/azerbaijan-win-eurovision-song-contest-2011.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 July 2012|author=Daniel Sperling|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baku]], the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the [[Caspian Sea]] and of the [[Caucasus]] region, was named the host city for the contest, with the venue being the [[Baku Crystal Hall]], built a few months prior to the contest on the city's coastline.

Shortly after Azerbaijan's victory at the 2011 edition, officials announced that a new 23,000 seat concert venue was to be built near [[National Flag Square]] in Baku, as a potential venue for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Для "Евровидения-2012" будет построена новая арена?|url=http://anspress.com/index.php?a=2&amp;lng=ru&amp;nid=100849|publisher=anspress.com|accessdate=15 July 2012|author=Тарана Мустафаева|language=Russian|date=17 May 2011|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006043420/http://anspress.com/index.php?a=2&amp;lng=ru&amp;nid=100849|archive-date=6 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special concert complex for Eurovision 2012 to be built in centre of Baku |url=http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54165.html |publisher=abc.az |accessdate=9 August 2011 |date=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817135117/http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54165.html |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, other venue options were revealed by organisers, such as the 37,000-seat [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium]] and the [[Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan has not yet selected site for Eurovision 2012 |url=http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54292.html |publisher=abc.az |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522054754/http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54292.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2011, Alpine Bau Deutschland AG was awarded the contract to construct the Baku Crystal Hall.

[[File:Baku Crystal Hall.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Baku Crystal Hall, Baku - host venue of the 2012 contest.]]
On 8 September 2011, [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]] (ATV) reported that Baku Crystal Hall would be the venue of the contest, but no formal confirmation was made at the time by the EBU. On 31 October 2011, Ismayil Omarov, the director general of Azerbaijani national broadcaster [[İctimai Television]] announced that a decision on the venue choice would be taken by the steering committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General: Reference Group Baku Bound|url=http://www.escdaily.com/reference-group-baku-bound/|publisher=ESCDaily.com|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=29 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605192634/http://www.escdaily.com/reference-group-baku-bound/|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2012, it was confirmed that the Baku Crystal Hall would be the venue of the contest.&lt;ref name="Venue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Hall approved as Eurovision 2012 venue|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=45013&amp;_t=crystal_hall_approved_as_eurovision_2012_venue|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|author=Jarmo Siim|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the venue had an extended capacity of 23,000 people, only 16,000 people were able to attend each show.&lt;ref name="Venue"/&gt; Tickets for the contest became available online for purchase on 28 February 2012.&lt;ref name=VIP&gt;{{cite web|title=Venue likely to host Eurovision 2012 in Baku to be biggest ever in recent history of contest|url=http://en.trend.az/news/society/1929119.html|publisher=Trend News Agency|accessdate=1 September 2011|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baku 2012: Tickets on sale from 28th February|url=http://escxtra.com/2012/02/tickets-on-sale-from-28th-february/|publisher=ESCXtra.com|accessdate=16 June 2012|author=Ryan Wilson|location=Australia|date=15 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513050659/http://escxtra.com/2012/02/tickets-on-sale-from-28th-february/|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting of the Eurovision Reference Group on 29 June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference Group of the Eurovision Song Contest|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/baku-2012/about/organisers/reference-group|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=16 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619004315/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/baku-2012/about/organisers/reference-group|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it was decided that the [[televoting]] system would revert the format used most recently in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 Contest]], in which the phone and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] lines opened for a fifteen-minute window after all songs had been performed, instead of opening before the show starts, which was the system used between [[Eurovision Song Contest|2010]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]]. The results format of each show remained the same with each country's votes being decided on a 50:50 split between televoting and a [[Jury|national jury]]. Each participating country had their own national jury, which consisted of five professional members of the music industry.&lt;ref name=VotingWindow&gt;{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=EBU restores televoting window as from 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=37013&amp;_t=ebu_restores_televoting_window_as_from_2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the official rules released on 24 November 2011, the number of participants in the final was raised to 26, including the host nation, the "[[Big Four (Eurovision)|Big Five]]", and the ten qualifiers from each semi-final.  This was the second time in the Eurovision Song Contest that 26 countries were in the final, the first being the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 Contest]].&lt;ref name=VotingWindow/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracts from the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest rules |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/ESC_2012_public_version_Rules_ENG.pdf |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=25 November 2011 |format=PDF |date=24 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165509/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2012/ESC_2012_public_version_Rules_ENG.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest History|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=217|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=24 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semi-final allocation draw ===
[[File:Eurovision Song Contest 2012, semi-final allocation draw (5).jpg|thumb|Semi-final allocation draw ceremony at the [[Buta Palace]] in Baku.]]
The draw that determined the semi-final running order was held on 25 January 2012 at the [[Buta Palace]]. The participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012.&lt;ref name="semi draw"/&gt; This draw also acted as an approximate running order, in order for the delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.&lt;ref name="Semi allocation 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Eurovision 2012 slogan presented on 25 January|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=44733&amp;_t=eurovision_2012_slogan_presented_on_25_january|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=24 January 2012|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RunningOrder&gt;{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Baku: All songs officially presented to EBU|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=49583&amp;_t=baku_all_songs_officially_presented_to_ebu|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=19 March 2012|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graphic design ===
[[File:Crystal Hall Baku Inside.jpg|thumb|Stage design of the contest.]]
The design of the contest was built around the motto "Light your fire!", inspired by the nickname of Azerbaijan itself, "Land of Fire".&lt;ref name=landoffire&gt;{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Baku 2012: Light your fire!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=43383&amp;_t=baku_2012_light_your_fire|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each introductory video [[postcard]] began with a shot of the artist and performers, followed with the flag and country name in a handwritten font with a background resembling the yellow, orange and red fire of the 2012 theme art.&lt;ref name=slogan/&gt; The postcards consisted of various shots of Azerbaijan, with a caption displaying 'Azerbaijan' and underneath 'Land of ...' (e.g. Land of Abundance; Land of Poetry etc.), which were then followed by the name of a town or geographic feature, showing the landscape and culture of the country.&lt;ref name=slogan/&gt; Some postcards focused on the host city of Baku with text changing to 'Baku' and underneath 'City of ...' (e.g. City of Jazz; City of Leisure etc.). The postcards finished with a shot of the Crystal Hall displayed in the colours of the performing country's flag.  These postcards acted as a [[tourism]] mechanism to present the country to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=first_semi-final_under_way_-_watch_it_live_here|title=First Semi-Final concludes, we have ten finalists!|date=22 May 2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=second_semi-final_live_we_have_our_ten_qualifiers|title=Second Semi-Final: We have our ten qualifiers|date=24 May 2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist, song and number graphics as well as tables and voting graphics were kept the same as those used in 2011, with a slight modification to incorporate the 2012 theme art.&lt;ref name=slogan/&gt; The lower points (1-7) were highlighted in red squares while the top points (8, 10, 12) were highlighted in orange squares with each square increasing in size in relation to the point value. Both sets of graphics were designed by London brand design agency [[London Stock Exchange#Turquoise|Turquoise Branding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turquoisebranding.com/2012/work/01/25/eurovision-2012-light-your-fire/|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2012 Official Logo + Visual Identity|date=25 January 2012|publisher=[[London Stock Exchange#Turquoise|Turquoise Branding]]|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530015617/http://www.turquoisebranding.com/2012/work/01/25/eurovision-2012-light-your-fire/|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=43383&amp;_t=baku_2012_light_your_fire|title=Baku 2012: Light your fire!|date=25 January 2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a statement to the [[BBC]], Eurovision said that on a recent visit to Baku they had observed "that the construction of the concert hall [which] media reports refer to was already well under way on a clean construction site and thus there are no demolitions needed".&lt;ref name="BBC16223311"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuinness|first=Damien|title='Evicted in Baku to make way for Eurovision'|publisher=BBC News|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16223311| accessdate=17 May 2012| date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU cited the "apolitical" nature of the contest and the Azerbaijani government's claim that the construction was not tied to the Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

The festival's winner Loreen met [[Human rights in Azerbaijan|local human rights]] activists during the contest, the only entrant to do so. She later told reporters, "Human rights are violated in Azerbaijan every day. One should not be silent about such things."&lt;ref name=Reut255&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/25/azerbaijan-eurovision-idUSL5E8GP85U20120525 |title=Swedish Eurovision star strays into Azeri rights row |author=Margarita Antidze |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Azerbaijan government spokesman criticized her in response, saying that the contest should not "be politicised"&lt;ref name=Reut255/&gt; and requested the EBU prevented further meetings of a similar nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaidzhan syyttaa ruotsin viisuedustajaa politikoinnista |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/azerbaidzhan_syyttaa_ruotsin_viisuedustajaa_politikoinnista/6109366 |publisher=[[YLE]] |accessdate=15 July 2012 |language=Finnish |date=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527034208/http://yle.fi/uutiset/azerbaidzhan_syyttaa_ruotsin_viisuedustajaa_politikoinnista/6109366 |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish diplomats replied that the EBU, Swedish TV and Loreen had not acted against the competition's rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loreen mitt i diplomatiskt drama|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/loreen-mitt-i-diplomatiskt-drama |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=15 July 2012|language=Swedish|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May, a [[flash mob]] of anti-government protesters were quickly dispersed by police.&lt;ref name=AP265 /&gt; Activists expressed fears that they would face a crackdown when the international spotlight left Azerbaijan again at the end of the contest.&lt;ref name=Guardian255 /&gt;  Before submitting the results of the German vote, the presenter from Germany [[Anke Engelke]] gave a live statement that alluded to the human rights issues in Azerbaijan, saying: "Tonight nobody could vote for their own country.

=== Tensions with Iran ===
Iranian officials objected to Azerbaijan hosting the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest. Iranian clerics Ayatollah [[Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari]] and Ayatollah [[Ja'far Sobhani]] condemned Azerbaijan for "anti-Islamic behaviour", claiming that Azerbaijan were going to host a [[Pride parade|gay parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Antidze|first=Margarita|title=Iran's "gay" Eurovision jibes strain Azerbaijan ties|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/22/azerbaijan-iran-idUKL5E8GM61H20120522|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to protests in front of Iranian embassy in Baku, where protesters carried slogans mocking the Iranian leaders. [[Ali Hasanov (politician born 1960)|Ali Hasanov]], head of the public and political issues department in Azerbaijani President's administration, said that gay parade claims were untrue, and advised Iran not to meddle in Azerbaijan's internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65433|publisher=EurasiaNet.org|title=Azerbaijan: Pop Music vs. Islam|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=21 May 2012|last=Lomsadze|first=Girgoi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Iran recalled its ambassador from Baku,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/22/215722.html|publisher=AFP|title=Iran recalls envoy to Azerbaijan ahead of Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Azerbaijan demanded a formal apology from Iran for its statements in connection with Baku's hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/05/24/azerbaijan-demands-apology-from-iran-over-eurovision/|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|title=Azerbaijan Demands Apology From Iran Over Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later also recalled its ambassador from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan-iran-recall-ambassador/24597902.html|title=Azerbaijan Recalls Ambassador To Iran|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May, the [[Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan]] announced that they had thwarted a series of planned terror attacks against the Eurovision Song Contest, among the targets being Baku Crystal Hall, as well as [[JW Marriott Absheron Baku Hotel|Marriott]] and [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton]] hotels in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mammadov|first=Elman|title=Eurovision 'terror plot' thwarted: Azerbaijan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g0BB2S9CKtuayJhgOEMhdkzTRTKw?docId=CNG.60490b622cc956adb6a886ff4c892ab7.801|work=[[American Free Press]]|publisher=[[Google News]]|accessdate=15 July 2012|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that according to Western intelligence services, Iran's Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] personally gave orders to the elite [[Quds Force]] unit to launch terrorist attacks against the West and its allies, including Azerbaijan during the Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Con|title=Iran's supreme leader orders fresh terror attacks on West

=== Voting and spokespersons ===
The order in which each country announced their vote was determined in a draw following the jury results from the final dress rehearsal. Similar to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011 contest]] an [[algorithm]] was used to add as much excitement as possible. The spokespersons are shown alongside each country.&lt;ref name="voting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roxburgh|first=Gordon|title=Running order for the voting tonight|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=running_order_for_the_voting_tonight|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=26 May 2012|date=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;10.{{note|j}} Ireland was originally scheduled to announce its votes as the 32nd country, but instead voted 42nd (last). The reason for this was technical difficulties in the minutes running up to the voting presentation.&lt;/small&gt;

=== Commentators ===
Most countries sent commentators to [[Baku]] or commentated from their own country, in order to add insight to the participants and, if necessary, the provision of voting information.

A '''foreign body''' ('''FB''') is any object originating outside the body of an [[organism]]. In machinery, it can mean any unwanted intruding object.

Most references to foreign bodies involve propulsion through natural [[Body orifice|orifice]]s into hollow organs.

Foreign bodies can be inert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause [[inflammation]] and [[scar]]ring. They can bring [[infection]] into the body or acquire infectious agents and protect them from the body's [[immune system|immune defenses]]. They can obstruct passageways either by their size or by the scarring they cause. Some can be [[toxicity|toxic]] or generate toxic chemicals from reactions with chemicals produced by the body, as is the case with many examples of ingested metal objects.

With sufficient force (as in firing of [[bullet]]s), a foreign body can become lodged into nearly any tissue.

==Gastrointestinal tract==
{{main|Foreign body in alimentary tract}}
One of the most common locations for a foreign body is the [[alimentary tract]].

It is possible for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the mouth, or from the rectum.

Both children and adults experience problems caused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies. Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to stick things in their ears and up their noses.&lt;ref name="urlForeign Bodies: Nose and Paranasal Sinus Disorders: Merck Manual Professional"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch091/ch091d.html |title=Foreign Bodies: Nose and Paranasal Sinus Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AhaFo1Ya?url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec08/ch091/ch091d.html |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of a foreign body can be very different. For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally, is not a medical emergency to remove. A [[button battery]], which can be a very similar size to a coin, generates hydroxide ions at the anode and causes a chemical burn in 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litovitz|first=Toby|url=http://www.poison.org/battery|title=Swallowed a Button Battery?|publisher=National Capital Poison Center|accessdate=11 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AhaFKAhI?url=http://www.poison.org/battery|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ingested button battery that is stuck in the esophagus is a medical emergency. In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested nonmagnetic foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Avolio L, Martucciello G.(2009 Jun)."Images in clinical medicine. Ingested magnets".N Engl J Med. 25;360(26):2770&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Airways==
{{main|Foreign body aspiration}}
It is possible for a foreign body to enter the airways and cause [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview|title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine|format=|work=|accessdate=2008-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227015106/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview|archivedate=2008-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, [[peanut]]s were the most common obstruction.&lt;ref name="pmid17728968"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yadav SP, Singh J, Aggarwal N, Goel A |title=Airway foreign bodies in children: experience of 132 cases |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=850–3 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17728968 |doi= |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/4809/4809a10.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201153813/http://smj.sma.org.sg/4809/4809a10.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to peanuts, hot dogs, and grapes, latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign body in the bronchi can also present as chronic cough.&lt;ref&gt;Gyanshankar Mishra, Jasmin Mulani. A non–resolving consolidation which was caused by abronchial foreign body in an adult: A case report. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research [serial online] 2013 August [cited: 2013 Aug 3 ]; 7:1750-1752. Available from {{cite web |url=http://www.jcdr.net/back_issues.asp?issn=0973-709x&amp;year=2013&amp;month=August&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=8&amp;page=1750-1752&amp;id=3255 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203234/http://www.jcdr.net/back_issues.asp?issn=0973-709x&amp;year=2013&amp;month=August&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=8&amp;page=1750-1752&amp;id=3255 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyes==
Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of people at any age. These foreign bodies often result in [[allergy|allergies]] which are either temporary or even turn into a chronic allergy. This is especially evident in the case of [[dust]] particles.

It is also possible for larger objects to lodge in the eye. The most common cause of intraocular foreign bodies is [[hammer]]ing.&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body, Intraocular: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230338-overview|title=Foreign Body, Intraocular: Overview - eMedicine|format=|work=|accessdate=2008-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224235204/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230338-overview|archivedate=2008-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign bodies in the eye affect about 2 per 1,000 people per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Faheem|last1=Ahmed|first2=Robert James|last2=House|first3=Brad Hal|last3=Feldman|title=Corneal Abrasions and Corneal Foreign Bodies|journal=Primary Care|date=1 September 2015|issn=1558-299X|pages=363–375|volume=42|issue=3|pmid=26319343|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2015.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin==
[[File:Suture micrograph.jpg|thumb|Surgical suture. H&amp;E stain.]]
[[Splinter]]s are common foreign bodies in skin. ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection often causes [[boil]]s to form around them.&lt;ref name=Microbiology&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fisher, Bruce |author2=Harvey, Richard P. |author3=Champe, Pamela C. |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year= |pages= |isbn=0-7817-8215-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tetanus]] prophylaxis may be appropriate.&lt;ref name="pmid17894138"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Halaas GW |title=Management of foreign bodies in the skin |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=683–8 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17894138 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peritoneum==
Foreign bodies in the [[peritoneum]] can include [[retained surgical instruments]] after [[abdominal surgery]]. Rarely, an [[intrauterine device]] can perforate the uterine wall and enter the peritoneum.

Foreign bodies in the peritoneum eventually become contained in a [[foreign body granuloma]]. In the extremely rare case of retained [[ectopic pregnancy]], this forms a [[lithopedion]]

[[File:Pulmonary talcosis low mag cropped.jpg|right|thumb|[[Talcosis]] of the lung due to [[intravenous drug use]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
Foreign bodies can also become lodged in other locations:

== Other animals ==
Foreign bodies are common in animals, especially young [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Dogs will readily eat toys, bones, and any object that either has food on it or retains the odor of food. Unlike humans, dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the [[esophagus]]. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the [[stomach]] because of the inability to pass through the [[pyloric sphincter]], and in the [[jejunum]]. Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction include vomiting, abdominal pain (aggression), acute infection and depression due to [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/diseases-of-the-stomach-and-intestines-in-small-animals/gastrointestinal-obstruction-in-small-animals|title=Gastrointestinal Obstruction  in Small Animals - Digestive System - Merck Veterinary Manual|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of a foreign body is determined by its severity. The amount of time a foreign body is present, location of the object, degree of obstruction, previous health status of the animal and material the foreign body is made from can all relate to the severity of the condition. [[Peritonitis]] results if either the stomach or intestine has ruptured. Foreign bodies in the stomach can sometimes be removed by [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] retrieval or if necessary by [[gastrotomy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Very often a simple instrument to remove foreign bodies without operation endoscopy is the [[Hartmann Alligator Forceps]]. The instrument is manufactured from 8&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 m length. Foreign bodies in the jejunum are removed by [[enterotomy]].

Certain foreign bodies in animals are especially problematic. Bones or objects with sharp edges may cause tearing of the wall of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine and lead to peritonitis. [[Penny|Pennies]] swallowed in large numbers may cause [[zinc]] poisoning, which in dogs leads to severe [[gastroenteritis]] and [[hemolytic anemia]]. Linear foreign bodies can especially be dangerous.  A linear foreign body is usually a length of string or yarn with a larger object or clump of material at either end.  One end is usually lodged in the stomach or proximal small intestine and the other end continues to travel through the intestines.  The material becomes tightly stretched and the intestines may "accordion up" on themselves or be lacerated by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=vetmedicine&amp;cdn=homegarden&amp;tm=26&amp;f=21&amp;tt=8&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.peteducation.com/article.cfm%3Fcls%3D0%26cat%3D1765%26articleid%3D1181|title=About.com: http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=0&amp;cat=1765&amp;articleid=1181&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially common in cats who may enjoy playing with a ball of string or yarn.

In [[macroeconomics]], a '''general glut''' is an excess of supply in relation to demand, specifically, when there is more production in all fields of production in comparison with what resources are available to consume (purchase) said production.
This exhibits itself in a general [[recession]] or [[Depression (economics)|depression]], with high and persistent underutilization of resources, notably [[unemployment]] and idle factories.
The [[Great Depression]] is often cited as an archetypal example of a general glut.

The term dates to the beginnings of [[classical economics]] in the late 18th century, and there is a long-running debate on the existence, causes, and solutions of a general glut. Some classical and [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] argue that there are no general gluts, advocating a form of [[Say's law]] (conventionally but controversially phrased as "[[supply creates its own demand]]"), and that any idling is due to misallocation of resources ''between'' sectors, not overall, because overproduction in one sector necessitates underproduction in others, as is demonstrable in severe price falls when such alleged '[[malinvestment]]' in gluts clear; unemployment is seen as voluntary, or a transient phenomenon as the economy adjusts. Others cite the frequent and recurrent [[economic crises]] of the [[economic cycle]] as examples of a general glut, propose various causes and advocate various solutions, most commonly [[fiscal stimulus]] (government [[deficit spending]]), a view advocated in the 19th and early 20th century by [[underconsumptionist]] economists, and in the mid to late 20th and 21st century by [[Keynesian economics]] and related [[schools of economic thought]].

One can distinguish between those who see a general glut (greater supply than demand) as a supply-side issue, calling it ''[[overproduction]]'' (excess production), and those who see it as a demand-side issue, calling it ''[[underconsumption]]'' (deficient consumption). Some believe that both of these occur, such as [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]], one of the earliest modern theorists of the economic cycle.

== Classical economic theory ==
===Introduction===
The general glut problem is identified within the classical [[political economy]] of the era of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Two Hundred Years of Say's Law: Essays on Economic Theory's Most Controversial Principle | editor = Steven Kates | isbn = 978-1-84064-866-9 | chapter = 8. The Historical Context of the General Glut Controversy | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=ISowzraNmrkC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22General+glut%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that, as labor becomes specialized, if people want a higher standard of living, they must produce more. However, producing more lowers prices and leads to the need to produce yet more in response. If those who have money choose not to spend it, then it is possible for a national economy to become glutted with all of the goods it produces, and still be producing more in hopes of overcoming the deficit. While [[Say's Law]] supposedly dealt with this problem, successive economists came up with new scenarios which could throw an economy out of [[General equilibrium]], or require expansion through conquest, which became termed [[imperialism]].

===The nature of the general glut===
In Classical Economics, the chief economic concern of all economists according to Thomas Sowell (On Classical Economics, 2006, pp. 22) was how to generate and sustain stable economic growth on a national level. Each factory-producer's basic concern is of maximizing return on investment through sales.  Yet, concern was also expressed that savings (and not spending money by the wealthy classes) or production of the wrong items contrary to market demand would produce a nationwide economic glut (a.k.a. recession/depression) because of the un-purchased (unconsumed) products which result in unemployment, idle factories, low national output, and wealth fleeting from the nation.  Some theorized that a general glut is then (in the basic case over time) avoidable and not inevitable.  Say's Law says, Since "savings equals investment" in a bank or other wise, money is always spent and ultimately reinvested into more or newer production activities which generates demand (both for the production resources and the items produced). Say's Law: Since "demand is always present," then, "production generates its own demand."  Then if a glut exists, producers must react to market demand liquidating glut items and produce the items the market desires.  Demand will return and any remaining glut will then be distributed by the market.  A company/country only needs to keep producing, or produce more wisely, or respond to market conditions with products that meet consumer's demands to avoid a (national recession/depression) glut.

===Say's law===
{{Main|Say's law}}
According to French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], the concentration of wealth into resources dedicated to savings and re-investment simply adds to the ability of consumption to consume more.  And so, he states, there can be no general glut because investment in "production creates its own demand."  A producer/country only need liquidate the glut items and redirect its production activities to items the market demands to eliminate the glut and prosperity will return.

===Malthus's solution===
[[Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] proposed that a glut of production localised in time rather than by industry or field of production would meet the requirement of Say's Law that general gluts cannot exist and yet would constitute just such a general glut.&lt;ref name="fonseca"&gt;{{Harv|Fonseca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences then are worked out by Malthus, although [[Sismondi|Simond de Sismondi]] first proposed this problem before him. Malthus is more famous for his earlier writings which tried to prove the opposite problem, a general over-consumption, as an inevitability to be lived with rather than solved.

== Keynesian ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[Keynesian economics]], and [[underconsumptionism]] before it, argue that fiscal stimulus in the form of government deficit spending can solve general gluts.

This is a ''demand'' side theory, rather than the supply-side theory of classical economics; the fundamental ideas are that savings in a recession or depression causes the [[paradox of thrift]] (excess saving, or more pejoratively, "hoarding"), causing a deficit of [[effective demand]], yielding a general glut. Keynes locates the cause in [[sticky wages]] and [[liquidity preference]].

== Marxian ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Karl Marx's critique of Malthus started from a position of agreement. Marx's idea of capitalist production, however, is characterized by his concentration on the division of labor and his notion that goods are produced for sale and not for consumption or exchange. In other words, goods are produced simply for the intention of transforming output into money. The possibility of a lack of effective demand, therefore, is held only in the possibility that there might be a time lag between the sale of a commodity (the acquisition of money) and the purchase of another (its disbursement). This possibility, also originally crafted by Sismondi (1819), endorsed the idea that the circularity of transactions was not always complete and immediate. If money is held, Marx contended, even if for a little while, there is a breakdown in the exchange process and a general glut can occur. 

For Marx, since investment is part of aggregate demand, and the stimulus for investment is profitability, accumulation will continue unhindered as far as profitability is high. However, Marx saw that profitability had a tendency to fall, which would lead to a crisis in which insufficient investment generates an insufficiency of demand and a glut of markets. The crisis itself would operate to raise profitability, which would start a new period of accumulation. This would be the mechanism for crisis occurring repeatedly.

== Post-Keynesian ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Some [[Post-Keynesian]] economists see the cause of general gluts in the bursting of [[credit bubble]]s, particularly [[speculative bubbles]]. In this view, the cause of a general glut is the shift from private sector deficit spending to private sector savings, as in the [[debt-deflation]] hypothesis of [[Irving Fisher]] and the Financial Instability Hypothesis of [[Hyman Minsky]], and locate the paradox of thrift in paying down debt. The shift from spending more than one earns to spending less than one earns (in the aggregate) causes a sustained drop in effective demand, and hence a general glut.

== Austrian ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

[[Austrian economics]] do not see "general glut" as a meaningful way of describing an economy, indeed Austrian Economists do not believe it is possible to have too much of everything. In the Austrian analysis, it is the misallocation of resources that should be avoided. Producing too much of the wrong things, and not enough of the right things, is what Austrians believe to be truly wrong with an economy&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/says-law-markets&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''H*Commerce: The Business of Hacking You''''' is a six-part online [[documentary film]] series directed by [[Seth Gordon]]. It centers on the struggle between [[Black hat hacking|criminal hackers]] and [[Internet security|security experts]]. Each segment is between five and eight minutes in length. The first was released on the Internet on May 20, 2009.&lt;ref name=SecurityProNews&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Jason Lee|coauthors=|title=McAfee Taps H-wood, The Woz, For Cybercrime Film Series|work=Security Pro News|place=|pages=|language=|publisher=iEntry, Inc.|date=20 May 2009|url=http://www.securitypronews.com/insiderreports/insider/spn-49-20090520McAfeeTapsHwoodtheWozforCybercrimeFilmSeries.html|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"H*Commerce" stands for "hacker commerce",&lt;ref name=SecurityProNews/&gt; specifically "the business of making money through the illegal use of technology to compromise personal and business data," according to McAfee.&lt;ref name=eWeek/&gt;

==Synopsis==

The main narrative follows the story of [[Sweet Home, Oregon]] resident Janella Spears, who falls victim to an elaborate Nigerian [[Advance-fee fraud|419 scam]]. Initiated by e-mail, the scammers promise Spears and her family the return of a dead relative's lost fortune. Interested in her family's genealogy and persuaded by a death certificate purported to be her relative's, Spears eventually loses US$440,000.&lt;ref name=NetworkWorld&gt;{{cite news|last=Messmer|first=Ellen|title=Video focuses on victims of e-mail scam|work=Network World|publisher=IDG|date=20 May 2009|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/052009-victims-email-scam.html?hpg1=bn|accessdate=11 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615004527/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/052009-victims-email-scam.html?hpg1=bn|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also features [[Denver, Colorado]]-based [[computer forensics]] expert Chris Roberts, who provides both counseling and technical support to the Spears family as they deal with the emotional challenges brought about by their mounting debt, as well as the resultant anger and distrust.&lt;ref name=ChannelWire&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Stefanie|title=McAfee Warns Of Cybercrime Dangers, Hollywood-Style|work=The Channel Wire|publisher=United Business Media LLC|date=20 May 2009|url=http://www.crn.com/security/217600377;jsessionid=V2XQFHVQ5VOKEQSNDLPSKHSCJUNN2JVN|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

The series focuses on the growing threat of cybercrime and explores the evolution of computer hacking from phone phreaking to a multibillion-dollar criminal industry that targets individuals with tools such as botnets and [[DDOS]] attacks. The series also explores other hacking-related topics such as malware, site scraping and spear phishing. It also focuses on online safety education and safe shopping.&lt;ref name=SecurityProNews/&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] cofounder [[Steve Wozniak]] makes an appearance as well to talk about his phone phreaking days,&lt;ref name=SecurityProNews/&gt; as does [[phreaking]] pioneer [[John Draper|John "Captain Crunch" Draper]].&lt;ref name=PCMag&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubenking|first=Neil J.|coauthors=|title=McAfee Debuts Series of Web Films on Hacking You|work=PC Magazine|place=|pages=|language=|publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc.|date=20 May 2009|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2347417,00.asp|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Wozniak explains that hackers and phreakers originally maintained a strong ethic, using their techniques not to "rip people off or make money" but "to explore". Draper observes that the imprisonment of hackers had unintended side-effects: "Once I got busted, I had to tell everybody else in jail how to do it and then the cat's out of the bag. The next thing you know, the mob has this technology."&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt;

According to McAfee, Americans lost a total of almost $8.5 billion due to Internet-enabled crimes between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|last=Swartz|first=Jon|coauthors=|title=Miniseries reveals truth about hackers|work=USA Today|place=|pages=| language=|publisher=|date=20 May 2009|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/technologylive/2009/05/miniseries-reveals-truth-about-hackers.html|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

''H*Commerce'' was produced by [[antivirus software]] maker McAfee as part of a campaign to educate consumers about online security threats.&lt;ref name=AdWeek&gt;{{cite news|last=Morrissey|first=Brian|coauthors=|title=McAfee Web Docs Aim to Sound Security Alarm|work=AdWeek|place=| pages=|language=|publisher=|date=19 May 2009|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3ic8543054a8a9084d8534f6a87f075269|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon, best known for ''[[Four Christmases]]'' and ''[[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'', was hired to direct.&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt; The series was shot in [[High-definition video|HD]].&lt;ref name=SecurityProNews/&gt;

The project was originally conceived as a series of standalone episodes,&lt;ref name=eWeek/&gt; with each highlighting a different aspect of online crimes, including [[phishing]], bank scraping, and e-mail scams.&lt;ref name=eWeek&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Getcha Popcorn Ready - Malware Goes to the Movies|work=eWeek Security Watch|place=|pages=|language=|publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc.|date=21 May 2009|url=http://securitywatch.eweek.com/virus_and_spyware/getcha_popcorn_ready_-_malware_goes_to_the_movies.html|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during pre-production research, Gordon identified Spears as an example of how typical Internet users are vulnerable to criminals, and decided to make her the focus of the entire series.&lt;ref name=TechHerald/&gt;

Millam stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We produced the Web-based film to make cybercrime real for people, and to help consumers understand why they need to take precautions. The days when hackers were a small group of thrill-seekers breaking into computers to gain fame and notoriety are behind us. Now, hacking for profit, or what we call H*Commerce, is a global industry.&lt;ref name=TechHerald/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Distribution and marketing==

Promotion for the film, and the site on which it appears, was conducted primarily online through banner ads and trailers as well as a social media and mobile campaign. In New York and San Francisco, McAfee conducted a poster campaign featuring artwork similar to those created by [[Saul Bass]] for [[Alfred Hitchcock]] by [[San Francisco]] Graphic Designer, Nicole Flores.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Nicole|title=McAfee // H*Commerce
|url=http://www.welovecompany.com/McAfee-H-Commerce|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's website also offers additional resources to learn about cybercrime and online safety, as well as a  McAfee's Cybercrime Response Unit, a free service for consumers who believe they have been the victim of a cybercrime.

The '''IOOF Opera House''' in [[Hampton, Nebraska]], United States, is a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} building that was built in 1880 and was leased to the [[International Order of Odd Fellows]] (IOOF) chapter in 1893.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The NRHP registration document states once that it was built in 1880, but notes that "1893" is written on the parapet of the building, without explaining the discrepancy.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, when it was nominated for the [[National Register of Historic Places]], it was the only two-story building in the retail business area of Hampton.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;

It was deemed significant at the state level in the areas of the performing arts; entertainment/recreation; and social history, as a well-preserved example of an opera house building in Nebraska.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=88000952}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: I.O.O.F.

Its decline was partly due to the fact that [[Aurora, Nebraska]], 6 miles away, and [[Grand Island, Nebraska]], 26 miles away, offered more entertainment choices to car-owning residents.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;

It is a "two-part commercial block" building that served historically as a meeting hall, as a theater, as a specialty store, as a music facility, and as a financial institution.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

The '''''International Tournée of Animation''''' was an annual touring program of [[animated|animated films]] selected and assembled from films from many countries around the world and which existed from about 1970 to the late 1980s.  As released to cinemas, college campuses, and art museums and centers across the [[United States]], a typical Tournée program ran about 105 minutes and consisted of 15 to 24 animated films in the [[16mm]] format, each running from 1 or 2 minutes to 15 or 18 minutes each in length. 

==Typical program content==

An example of the typical range of countries represented comes from the '''12th Tournée''' in 1978 which contained 24 films (including specially produced opening titles), 10 of which were from US sources, 3 from the [[National Film Board of Canada]], 1 other independently made Canadian film, 2 each from [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (both from [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] Animation), and 1 each from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], and [[Japan]]. Altogether over twenty annual programs were prepared and presented; the '''''17th International Tournée of Animation''''' was devoted entirely to the films of the National Film Board of Canada.

==History==
About 1966, several members of [[ASIFA-Hollywood]] (The Los Angeles branch of ASIFA, the [[International Animated Film Association]]) decided to put together an international animation program to be shown at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. It was almost impossible to see quality animation in the US at that time. [[Prescott Wright]] became active with the group when he joined the [[American Film Institute]] in 1969 and, having worked previously in film distribution, he was asked to head the project when it was decided to show the program in other cities. 

Under Wright's guidance, the program became known as the "International Tournée of Animation" and, by late 1970, he began to book the program at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], university campuses, and other cultural institutions around the US.

The animators were offered a generous contract as part of their agreement to enter their films in the Tournée. As producers, Wright and his associates received 50% of the gross, while the remaining 50% was split among the artists. About half of the money going to the animators was split evenly between each filmmaker and the remaining amount was split based the length of each short film. This meant that a very short film got slightly less one which was a minute or two longer. 

===Sources of films shown in Tournees===
Many of the films were acquired as a result of Wright's travels to a number of the international animated film festivals sponsored by ASIFA.  These included festivals such as the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] in [[France]], the [[Zagreb]] Festival (which was then in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]), the [[Ottawa International Animated Film Festival]] in [[Canada]] after 1976, and the [[Hiroshima International Animation Festival]] in [[Japan]].  Until the Iron Curtain collapsed, ASIFA helped bridge the gap between East and West by helping animators from Eastern Europe attend festivals in the West, to visit studios in the Europe and North America, and to show their films in-person. Prescott Wright and filmmakers [[John Halas]] along with the husband-and-wife team of [[John Hubley]] and [[Faith Hubley]] plus many others worked hard to further international relations and to arrange for these screenings in cities with ASIFA chapters.

===Increased visibility through theatrical screenings===
In the mid-1970s, the Tournée increased its visibility by being screened in cinemas, initially with the [[Landmark Theatres]] chain, but gradually seen in many smaller "art houses" across the country. In 1986 Prescott Wright sold the rights to the Tournées to the [[Expanded Entertainment]] group in Los Angeles which continued to organize them for several years with Wright's guidance.

==Other packages of animated films==
Other packages of animated films began to emerge and be distributed from the late 1970s, including ''The Classic Festival of Animation'', ''[[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]]'', and ''The Animated Film Festival''.

'''Les villages détruits (the destroyed villages)''' are in northern France, mostly in the [[France|French]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]].

During the [[World War I|First World War]], specifically at the time of the [[Battle of Verdun]] in 1916, many villages in northern France were destroyed by the fighting. After the war, it was decided that the land previously occupied by the destroyed villages would not be incorporated into other [[commune in France|commune]]s, as a testament to these villages which had "died for France", as they were declared, and to preserve their memory. While three of the villages were subsequently rebuilt and are governed as normal communes, the other six are entirely unpopulated and are managed by a council of three members, appointed by the [[préfet|prefect]] of Meuse. All of these communes are located in the Canton of Charny-sur-Meuse in the [[Arrondissement of Verdun]], and are located generally north of the city of [[Verdun]], in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of northeastern France.

'''Louis J. Weichmann''' (September 29, 1842 &amp;ndash; June 5, 1902) was one of the chief witnesses for the prosecution in the trial of the alleged conspirators involved in the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. Previously, he had been also a suspect in the conspiracy because of his association with [[Mary Surratt]]'s family.

==Early life==
Weichmann was born in [[Baltimore]], the son of German immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Lincoln's Avengers: Justice, Revenge, and Reunion After the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOC3SMl00cgC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2004|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-04868-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family surname was originally Wiechmann, but as in the case of many who emigrated to the United States, the name underwent several phonetic spelling changes. His father Johann was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], and his mother Maria was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]]. Johann Weichmann was a tailor by trade, and he moved with his wife and their five children first from the vicinity of Baltimore to [[Washington D.C.]], and later to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Louis claims to have attended [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in the autobiographical work mentioned below. Central High School records show Louis Weichmann was a member of the 36th graduating class. He was admitted July 1856 and left in Sept. 1858 with a Partial Course Diploma. He wrote in his autobiographical work, ''A True History of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln and of the Conspiracy of 1865,'' that he desired to pursue a career as a pharmacist, but, at the behest of his mother, he reluctantly agreed to study for the [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic priesthood]]. At the age of seventeen, he entered the seminary at [[St. Charles College (Maryland)|St. Charles College]] in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]]. There, he met and befriended a fellow seminarian, [[John Surratt]]. This friendship was to later have profound consequences for both of them.

In 1862, a year after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], both Weichmann and Surratt left the seminary without becoming priests. Weichmann went to Washington, D.C., where he taught school for two years at St. Matthew's Institute for Boys. After leaving this position in 1864, he became a clerk in the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], headed by Secretary [[Edwin Stanton]]. Surratt had in the meantime become a courier and agent for the [[Confederate State of America|Confederacy]], working out of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] territory. As a result of his earlier friendship with Surratt, Weichmann took lodgings in the boarding house of Surratt's mother, [[Mary Surratt]], in Washington, D.C. This brought him into contact with the major conspirators involved in [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s assassination. According to Weichmann's testimony at the trial of the conspirators, [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[David Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Payne]], [[George Atzerodt]], John Surratt, and others continually met at Mary Surratt's boarding house prior to the assassination.

Weichmann testified that on the day President Lincoln was shot, April 14, 1865, he accompanied Mary Surratt to her other property in Surrattsville, (now [[Clinton, Maryland]]), where she delivered items that Booth later retrieved hours after the assassination. He further testified that Mary Surratt met with Booth no fewer than three times on that fateful day. [[Samuel Mudd]], the doctor who treated Booth's broken leg on the night Lincoln was killed, and claimed to have no knowledge of the conspiracy, was linked by Weichmann's testimony to the events for which he was tried and found guilty as well. Augustus Howell, a blockade runner who worked with John Surratt, claimed during the trial that Weichmann provided the Confederates with classified information obtained by his position at the War Department. He supposedly hoped to obtain a better job from the Confederate government at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in exchange for his services; however, these accusations were never substantiated.

==Later life==
In his later years Weichmann moved to [[Anderson, Indiana]], where he opened a business school. One of his brothers, a Catholic priest, and two of his sisters had moved and settled there. Because of some lingering doubt as to the truth and motives of his testimony, Weichmann became a controversial and somewhat ostracized figure by many people. That Mary Surratt was the first woman tried and executed for a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]] by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] caused a backlash against him. There also were strong anti-Catholic elements that attempted to link Lincoln's death to a [[Anti-Catholicism|Catholic conspiracy]].

Partially because of this, he swore out an affidavit, shortly before his death, reaffirming that all his testimony concerning Abraham Lincoln's assassination was totally and completely true. He died a few days later in Anderson, and is buried there at St. Mary's Cemetery. Despite his using the spelling Weichmann at the conspiracy trial, in all his official correspondence and as the author of his book, the original family spelling of ''Wiechmann'' appears on his [[Headstone|tombstone]].

[[File:NKVD Order No. 00447.jpg|thumb|Excerpt of NKVD Order No. 00447]]
'''NKVD Order № 00447''' of July 30, 1937 ({{lang-ru|О репрессировании бывших кулаков, уголовников и других антисоветских элементов}}) &lt;small&gt;''O repressirovanii byvshikh kulakov, ugolovnikov i drugikh antisovyetskikh elementov''&lt;/small&gt; ("About repression of former kulaks, criminals, and other anti-Soviet elements") was signed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] and approved by [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] during the [[Great Purge]].&lt;ref name="Werth"&gt;{{Citation | author = Nicolas Werth | title = The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n° 00447 (August 1937 – November 1938) | work = Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence  | date = 24 May 2010 | accessdate = 8 July 2010 | url =  http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937 | issn = 1961-9898}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To execute this order, numerous [[NKVD troika]]s were created on republican and various regional levels ([[krai]] and [[oblast]]). Investigation was to be performed by operative groups "in a speedy and simplified way", the results were to be delivered to troikas for trials.

The chairman of a troika was the chief of the corresponding territorial subdivision of [[NKVD]] ([[People's Commissar]] of a republican NKVD, etc.). Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; if not, he or she was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the [[Communist Party]] secretary of the corresponding regional level. The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order № 00447.

Protocols of a troika session were passed to the corresponding operative group for executions of sentences. Times and places of executions of death sentences were ordered to be held in secret.

That same order instructed to classify [[kulak]]s and other ''anti-Soviet elements'' into two categories: the '''First category''' (Category I) of repressed was subject to death by shooting, the '''Second category''' (Category II) was to be sent to [[GULAG]] correctional-labor camps. The order also set upper quotas per territory and category of social classes (proletariat, peasant, kulak, bourgeois, others). 

For example, the [[Byelorussian SSR]] was estimated to have 2,000 (Cat. I) &amp; 10,000 (Cat. II), a total of 12,000 anti-Soviet social elements. It was specifically stressed that quotas were estimates and could not be exceeded without personal approval of Yezhov. But in practice this approval was easy to obtain, and eventually these initial quotas were exceeded by orders of magnitude. One instance in July 23, 1938, the [[Omsk]] [[NKVD]] chief named Gorbach requested an increased quota of thousands of more executions, since his men had already fulfilled their plan; the request was approved by Stalin personally, who promoted Gorbach to a larger district. By the autumn of 1937, the pressure to achieve arrests was so great that the NKVD interrogators began picking out names from the telephone directory or preselecting married men with children who, as every agent knew, were the quickest to confess. Within 1939, the system of repression was bursting at the seams—one tenth of the population might be arrested, but not half.&lt;ref&gt;The Forsaken, by Tim Tzouliadis pgs. 84-86; pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; 

After this Order, the terms First/Second Category became standard abbreviations in NKVD documentation for "the highest measure of punishment" and "placing into corrective labor camps", respectively.

The article III the Order of Conducting the Operation instructed to start the action for securing the anti-Soviet social elements on August 5, 1937 and finish it in four-month term. 

The implementation was swift. By August 15, 1937, 101,000 were arrested and 14,000 convicted. By the end of 1938, the NKVD had executed 386,798 Soviet citizens to fulfil order 00447.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0465002399|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nevin Karey Shapiro''' (born April 13, 1969) is a convicted felon who is currently imprisoned for orchestrating a $930 million [[Ponzi scheme]]. According to interviews, he engaged in [[2011 University of Miami athletics scandal|rampant violations]] of [[NCAA]] rules over eight years as a booster for University of Miami athletes.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Charles |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/investigations/news?slug=cr-renegade_miami_booster_details_illicit_benefits_081611 |title=Renegade Miami football booster spells out illicit benefits to players |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Early life==
Shapiro was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] to a Jewish family and moved with his family to Miami Beach, Florida at an early age. He graduated in 1986 from [[Miami Beach Senior High School]] in the same class as film director [[Brett Ratner]]. Shapiro, who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall, was a member of the school's [[basketball]] and [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] teams.&lt;ref name=robinson /&gt; A year after he graduated his mother married Richard Armand Adam, who operated RAA International, a real estate loan company. Adam moved the family to [[Lighthouse Point]] and bought two yachts. In 1997 Adam was charged in [[Canada]] with business [[fraud]], and was accused of stealing $6 million by collecting fees on loans that never materialized. Adam eventually served six years in Canadian prisons.

==Ponzi scheme==
Shapiro subsequently started Capitol Investments USA, which he claimed bought wholesale groceries and shipped them to more expensive markets (although he subsequently said that he never actually sold the groceries). Shapiro's Ponzi scheme was based on attracting investors to Capitol Investments.&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Elfrink |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/2592914/ |title=Nevin Shapiro: Miami's Caligula |publisher=[[Miami New Times]] |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He promised investors they would make 10 to 26 percent commissions every month.&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

In 2003, his business grew very quickly through connections with Sherwin Jarol in [[Chicago]], Craig Currie in [[New Jersey]], and Sydney "Jack" Williams who had real estate in [[Naples, Florida]], and [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

According to [[FBI]] Special Agent Gregory Yankow in a Federal Criminal Complaint dated April 20, 2010 (Case No. 10-8082), Shapiro "directed others to create and show to the investors documents fraudulently touting Capitol's profitability. Those documents included: financial statements; profit and loss figures fraudulently representing that Capitol's wholesale grocery business was generating tens of millions of dollars in annual sales; personal and business tax returns for Shapiro and Capitol also fraudulently reflecting those sales; and numerous invoices fraudulently reflecting transactions between Capitol and other companies in the wholesale grocery business."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2011/ceo-of-capitol-investments-usa-inc.-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-for-930-million-ponzi-scheme-based-on-phony-grocery-business |title=CEO of Capitol Investments USA, Inc. Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for $930 Million Ponzi Scheme Based on Phony Grocery Business |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Criminal Complaint, Shapiro incurred "millions of dollars in debts resulting from illegal gambling on sporting events; more than $400,000 for floor seats to the Miami Heat professional basketball team; approximately $26,000 monthly for mortgage payments on his residence in Miami Beach which was recently appraised at approximately $5.3 million; approximately $7,250 monthly for payments on a $1.5 million Riviera yacht; approximately $4,700 monthly for the lease of a Mercedes-Benz automobile;" and an undisclosed amount "for a pair of diamond-studded handcuffs, which he gifted to a prominent professional athlete." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The FBI reported that he had diverted $35 million&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; for his personal use from 2005 to 2009. Shapiro allegedly rented his yacht to [[NBA]] stars [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Kevin Garnett]] and pledged $150,000 to the University of Miami to have his name placed on the student lounge.&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

The scheme fell apart in November 2009 during the [[late-2000s recession]], when Chicago real estate investor Sherwin Jarol sued to force him into involuntary bankruptcy after Shapiro had stopped making payments to his investors. More than 60 investors (largely from Naples, Indianapolis, and Chicago), including [[Barry Alvarez]], filed claims (Alvarez had $600,000 in the scheme).&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

On April 21, 2010 he was charged in New Jersey with [[securities fraud]] and [[money laundering]].

On September 15, 2010, he pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge [[Susan D. Wigenton]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in U.S. v. Shapiro, 10-cr-00471 to one count of securities fraud and one count of money laundering. On June 7, 2011, he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison and ordered to make $82,657,362.29 in restitution.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Voreacos |first=David |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-07/nevin-shapiro-gets-20-years-in-880-million-ponzi-scheme.html |title=Wholesale Grocery Owner Gets 20-Year Sentence in $930 Million Ponzi Scam |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving time at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Butner Low]] (inmate #61311-050), and is scheduled for release in October, 2027 (as of October, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Nevin&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Shapiro&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=&amp;x=51&amp;y=16 |title=Federal Bureau of Prisons |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil case in Miami is [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] v. Shapiro, 10-cv-21281.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;

==University of Miami scandal==
{{Main|2011 University of Miami athletics scandal}}
In August 2010 Shapiro told the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' that he was writing a book ''The Real U: 2001 to 2010. Inside the Eye of the Hurricane'' in which he promised to tell how Miami had violated NCAA rules affecting more than 100 players. "Once the players turned pro, they turned their back on me. It made me feel like a used friend," he said.&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

Shapiro was reported to have spent $2 million from 2002 to 2010 boosting Miami sports—primarily football—but also including contact with the basketball team under [[Frank Haith]].

In 2002 he paid $1.5 million for 30 percent in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sports Agent Blog|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/miami-booster-claims-ufl-commissioner-provided-benefits-to-student-athletes-2011-8 |title=Miami Booster Claims UFL Commissioner Provided Benefits To Student-Athletes |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sports management company called Axcess Sports, which had been started by [[Michael Huyghue]]. The agency signed several Hurricanes including [[Vince Wilfork]].&lt;ref name=miaminewtimes1 /&gt;

On August 16, 2011 in a jailhouse interview with Yahoo! Sports writer Charles Robinson (conducted over 100 hours), Shapiro made good on the promise for the revelations exposing a lack of NCAA-mandated institutional oversight at the university which apparently allowed his illegal and unethical behaviors to continue unimpeded for years. Thus far 72 athletes are alleged by Shapiro to have received "impermissible" benefits from him between 2002 and 2010. The players include [[Vince Wilfork]], [[Jon Beason]], [[Antrel Rolle]], [[Devin Hester]], [[Willis McGahee]] and the late [[Sean Taylor]].

The school imposed significant penalties on itself, including the suspension of eight football players and removing itself from post-season bowl contention for one year.  On October 22, 2013, after two-and-a-half years of investigation, the NCAA announced that the University of Miami football team would be docked three scholarships in each of the next three seasons, a three-year probation, recruiting restrictions, a five-game suspension for the men's basketball coach, and a two-year show-cause order on a total of three former assistant football and basketball coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/press-releases/university-miami-lacked-institutional-control-resulting-decade-violations |title=University of Miami lacked institutional control resulting in a decade of violations |publisher=[[NCAA]] |date=2013-10-22 |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering such a long investigation yielded very little incriminating evidence, it was widely viewed that the NCAA investigation and the media attention to the case did not match the relatively minor infractions that were proven to be committed. Before the NCAA penalties were announced, it had been revealed that enforcement staff for the NCAA had paid Shapiro's lawyer $25,000 to call in University of Miami personnel, during an unassociated legal [[deposition (law)|deposition]] for Shapiro's bankruptcy, and ask a specific list of questions related to the University's scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8919668/ncaa-approved-payment-25000-maria-elena-perez-nevin-shapiro-attorney-according-source |title=Source:Shapiro lawyer got money |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shapiro's attorney used her subpoena power in the bankruptcy case to question two witnesses who were crucial to the NCAA's case. The NCAA had no subpoena power, and neither witness had any obligation to talk to the association. The backlash from the revelations about the NCAA's activities, coupled with the University's unprecedented self-imposed sanctions, helped the Miami Hurricanes escape additional harsh penalties from the NCAA.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Adelson, ESPN.com October 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Photos in the Yahoo article showed him with [[Kellen Winslow II|Kellen Winslow Jr.]] and Joe Kolchinsky in the VIP section of the Opium Garden Nightclub in 2005; Shapiro with Haith, Joe Kolchinsky and University of Miami President [[Donna Shalala]] in 2008 as he donated $50,000 to the basketball program as well as $3 million in other donations to undisclosed recipients; and with Vince Wilfork in 2002.&lt;ref name=robinson /&gt;

'''[[:es:Festival de cine Película|Película]]''' (Spanish for a film; thin layer of any material) is a Spanish film festival held every October by the [[Instituto Cervantes|Instituto Cervantes de Manila]], in collaboration with the Embassy of Spain to the Philippines. Created in 2002, this event shows award-winning Spanish and Latin American films.

Due to the Película’s yearly success, the festival made big changes during its eighth season in 2009. The duration of the festival was lengthened, and the number of venues was increased from one to three venues to accommodate more films. The festival’s venues include the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines|Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)]], [[Greenbelt (Ayala Center)|Greenbelt Cinemas]], and the [[De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde|De La Salle- College of Saint Benilde School of Design and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pelicula.ph/index.html]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from film screenings, supplementary cultural events were also organized based on the yearly theme of the festival. Photographic exhibits, cinema workshops, music and dance performances add color to the film festival. These events do not only showcase the classical and contemporary Spanish culture to the Filipinos, but they also create a bridge between the Filipino and Spanish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.byahilo.com/2009/09/26/instituto-cervantes-stages-the-2009-spanish-film-festival-in-manila/]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pelicula.ph/index.html]"&lt;/ref&gt; Past events include Oscar F. Orengo's photographic exhibit of portraits of fort-four of the Philippines' greatest film directors, seminars on film directing by Max Lemcke and OScar Cardenas, and performances by Spain's leading vertical dance company called B612, award-winning flamenco guitarist [[Oscar Herrero]], and piano and violin duet named Duo Rivera, just to name a few.

'''Pencil fighting''' involves two players trying to break one-another's pencils using pencils. The World Extreme Pencil Fighting League is an organization of pencil fighters based in Seattle, Washington.

==Overview==
Pencil fighting typically involves two players attempting to break one-another's pencils.&lt;ref name="RocketNews24 2014"/&gt; Players take turns in which one player holds their pencil horizontally with both hands while the other player flicks their pencil at it in attempts to break it.&lt;ref name="RocketNews24 2014"/&gt; The first player to break the other's pencil is the winner.&lt;ref name="Applebaum DiSorbo Ferrari 2016"/&gt; Foul plays have been suggested, such as intentionally hitting a player on the fingers, dropping the pencil, and missing the pencil when striking.&lt;ref name="Applebaum DiSorbo Ferrari 2016"/&gt; When a foul has occurred, the offender may be required to allow a free extra strike against their pencil.&lt;ref name="Applebaum DiSorbo Ferrari 2016"/&gt;

==Risks==
Some risk of eye injury exists in pencil fighting, because pieces of wood and graphite inside the pencil can be launched when pencils are struck.&lt;ref name="Applebaum DiSorbo Ferrari 2016"/&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
It has been suggested that pencil fighting became popular toward the end of the 1970s, played by students despite the disapproval of school educators, i.e., "the teachers who would commonly issue two pencils to each student at the beginning of the school year and later only as required."

Pencil fighting in the late 1970s was also and more commonly known as "Pencil Break" or "Pencils." Elementary, Middle (Junior High) School, and High School students played the game often. It was such a beloved activity, students would either purchase, seek out, and or trade certain brands of pencils, known for their design and durability characteristics, e.g., strength of the wood, ability to bend backwards without breaking, so as to develop the greatest amount of force to break one's opponent's pencil in but a single strike! Often, students would simply walk up to classmates, hold one end of their pencil with both hands in a state of readiness. The other student almost instinctively knew and understood the meaning and request to play on sight. Students held word of mouth competitions before, after, and even during class in some instances; often near the back of a classroom, as students were required to line-up in order to use one of two industrial strength and wall mounted pencil sharpeners for regular pencil sharpening before, during, and after classes. Students sometimes would gather in small and even large circles and groups to play. Often, most one-on-one competitions were held on the school grounds, i.e., classroom hallways, in the school bathroom, in the school yard, next to and by the side or back of a class, while riding the school bus to and from school, and while on the way to events, trips, etc. Games commonly lasted less than half of one minute.

Pencil break was enjoyed the most when the opponent's pencil was either a new or freshly sharpened. However, the game was often played twice or several times, based on the final length left after a loss.  Advanced or Expert level players were able to break a pencil of any size brought before them. A standard No. 2 pencil could be realistically broken four times by an expert player. Novice players required several strikes before their opponents pencil was broken if ever. Some players removed the rubber eraser, forming the metal clamp into an edged point that was able to concentrate the cutting, sawing, and breaking power for each strike. Other players might chew on their pencil, compressing the wood so as to make it tougher to break a pencil. In most cases however, superior technique and method over the type of pencil and any upgrade was the preferred approach to winning consistently. It was common for an advanced player's pencil to last over several games before his pencil broke.

==World Extreme Pencil Fighting League==
The World Extreme Pencil Fighting League (WXPFL) is an organization and competitive league of pencil fighters based in Seattle, Washington that engages in pencil fighting competitions.&lt;ref name="Applebaum DiSorbo Ferrari 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WNPR 2014"/&gt; WXPFL events include wrestling-style theatrics, and are held monthly at a Seattle bar named Re-Bar.&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt; Number 2 style pencils are used,&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt; and the referee is the only person allowed to distribute the pencils.&lt;ref name="Watters 2012"/&gt; The events are monitored by referees, and penalties exist for delaying the event, pencil tilting and dropping a pencil.&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt; Those called on a foul can have their pencil struck with any sized pencil, as long as "it’s made of wood and you can actually write with it".&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt; The competition includes a champion who holds a championship belt.&lt;ref name="Neelman 2012"/&gt;

===1994-1995===
In 1994, three years after the devastating effects of the [[Mount Pinatubo]] eruption, Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, together with Korean businessman and hot-air balloon pilot, Mr. Sung Kee Paik, and [[British Airways]] General Manager, Mr. John Emery, and the German aviation enthusiast Max Motschmann engineered the first ever Philippine International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta to help jumpstart the local economy and spirit of the [[Central Luzon]] region with the commitment of developing hot air ballooning as an aviation sport in the country and making the Philippines one of the leading sports aviation and travel destinations in the Asia Pacific region.  The 1994 event originally organized by the Department of Tourism (DOT), the Hot Air Balloon Club, the Clark Development Corporation and British Airways initially began with 21 balloon pilots from 10 countries and one entry from the Philippines, represented by Capt. Joy Roa, the only registered Filipino balloon pilot at that time.  The success of the festival in 1994 brought about an increase in the number of participants in 1995 to 27 balloons including a basketless one-man balloon and two entries from the Philippines. The 1995 festival also saw the introduction of ultra light planes to the events.

===1996-1998===
By 1996 responsibility of the event was transferred from the Department of Tourism to Air Ads, Inc. under the watchful eyes of Captain Joy Roa who is also an avid licensed balloon pilot.  Between 1996 and 1998, the growing popularity of the festival was expanded to include other aero-sports activities such as sky diving, [[paragliding]], motorized [[hang gliding]], remote controlled [[model aircraft]] (aero modelers), and kite flying.  Aerobatic stunts and precision maneuvers courtesy of the Blue Diamonds and later the Red Aces of the Philippine Air Force became a regular attraction of the festival.&lt;ref name=T2&gt;Miko Santos [http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00009442 Asian Journal Online]. ''Hot Air Balloons Grace Pampanga’s Sky. '' Retrieved on February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999-2003===
Financial difficulties in 1999 led to the cancellation of the festival, but saw a resurgence in 2000 with 12 balloons and 18 light planes from Thailand, Japan and Singapore, all participating in an air rally which has become a regular component of the festivities. 2003 saw a change in the traditional ballooning format.  Specially designed balloons in the shape of a flying newspaper from Korea and a large dog from Japan made their debut over the Pampanga skyline.  Balloon participation from Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands drew crowds from around the world.

===2004-2016===
Currently, the Philippine International Hot Air Balloon Festival continues to be a popular international sports aviation event.  The 2006 festival featured 30 multicolored hot air balloons and more than a hundred balloon pilots from Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. It also drew an approximated 60,000 visitors to the event.&lt;ref name=T1/&gt;

===2017===
The 21st Philippine International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta showcased 30 colorful balloons from USA, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Hungary, Turkey, China, Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;21st Philippine International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The award-winning Twinz Aerobatic Paragliders as well as former members of the British Red Devils also participated in the event. The Fiesta's main theme was "Exchange of Cultures," a tribute to aviation's contributions in "making the world smaller." Apart from aviation enthusiasts, the Fiesta also invited artists and performers from around the world - including Turkish folk dancers, carpet makers and ceramic masters; international singers from South Africa, Samoa, New Zealand, and Zimbabwe; and the Amganad Music and Dance Ensemble from Banaue, Philippines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">'''Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere''' or '''RIDE''' is a sobriety testing program used by police in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The program began in 1977 as '''Reduce Impaired Driving in Etobicoke''' and the success of the program led to the expansion across the province of [[Ontario]].

The roadside spot-checks usually appear during the holidays to catch drunk drivers, but the program lasts year round. Volunteers are also enlisted to participate in the program. Officers from participating police forces are usually members of traffic and auxiliary units.

Police roadside spot-checks are set up on major roadways and off-ramps of highways. All drivers are stopped and interrogated upon reaching the checkpoint. If a driver is suspected to be intoxicated, the officer may request a roadside [[breathalyzer]] test. Drivers are also provided a pamphlet detailing the program.

Spot checks usually consist of several cruisers and pylons to direct cars into the area. Trailers are used to conduct breathalyzer testing. Tow trucks may be on standby to remove any vehicles with drivers caught drunk.

In 1985, the program was challenged as a violation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that the random roadside checks do not violate the ''Charter'' as long as they are carried out for the purposes of the R.I.D.E. program only. Police officers may not use R.I.D.E. stops as the basis for any other investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=Dedman v.

'''Sakhi for South Asian Women''' is an anti-domestic violence organization that works with the South Asian community in the New York metropolitan area.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1989 by a group of five South Asian women from diverse professional fields such as banking, film, law, and public health. Sakhi, which means "woman friend," was created to enable women to address domestic violence within the South Asian community.&lt;ref name = "About"&gt;{{cite web|title= Sakhi for South Asian Women website |url= http://www.sakhi.org/about-sakhi/ |work = Sakhi for South Asian Women website |accessdate= 2013-12-22 |archiveurl=

==Mission and organization==
The stated mission of Sakhi for South Asian Women is to end domestic violence against women by uniting survivors, communities, and institutions. Sakhi uses an integrated approach that combines support and empowerment through service delivery, community engagement, media advocacy, and policy initiatives.

Since its inception in 1989, Sakhi has served as a safe conduit to provide South Asian women with ongoing emotional support, culturally-sensitive and language-specific assistance in order to face the violence in their lives.  Sakhi has also been at the forefront of the effort to end domestic violence through community engagement, education, and outreach as well as broad policy and institutional change.

==Programs==
In the '''direct services''' arena, Sakhi offers:
* Crisis response for more than 700 new requests a year, including safety planning and an initial intake process with trained, multilingual staff who speak four major South Asian languages.
* Case management that encompasses translation services, accompaniments to courts, public benefits offices, health care visits, referrals for health, housing, legal assistance, and job training &amp; placement.
* Unique programs developed and tailored in-house to address survivors' needs, including monthly support groups, computer classes, financial literacy workshops, and grants for educational advancement.

In the area of '''community engagement and media advocacy''', Sakhi undertakes:
* Presentations and expert testimony, leading the discussion on domestic violence in three dozen different venues locally and nationally in 2008.
* Creation of innovative media products, including short films, a public service announcement, an award-winning website, and a digital monthly newsletter.
* Community campaigns to end violence including a neighborhood-based community action project in Richmond Hills, Queens, and a Faith-Based Initiative focused on documentation of survivors' thoughts on faith and cultivation of partnerships with faith communities and leaders.
* A multi-faceted volunteer program that invites and encourages broad-based community participation in creating safe homes and strong communities: in 2008, 70 interns and volunteers collectively donated 1 year and 7 months of time to advance Sakhi's programs to end violence.

In the sphere of '''policy advocacy''', Sakhi conducts:
* A groundbreaking legal access campaign to enhance court interpretation: via innovative research, presentations, and coalition-building, Sakhi has mobilized concrete changes in New York State courts including enhanced interpreter testing and training procedures as well as a landmark court rule providing access to an interpreter in civil and criminal cases; and,
* Mental health advocacy involving research and presentations on the link between mental health and domestic violence as well as expert testimony on the relationship between suicide and domestic violence.

'''''Silent Storm''''' is a 2003 Australian [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Peter Butt]].

== Synopsis ==
From 1957 to 1978, [[scientists]] secretly removed [[bone]] samples from over 21,000 dead Australians as they searched for evidence of the deadly [[poison]], Strontium 90 - a by-product of [[nuclear testing]]. Silent Storm reveals the story behind this astonishing case of officially sanctioned 'body-snatching'. Set against a backdrop of the [[Cold War]], the saga follows celebrated scientist, [[Hedley Marston]], as he attempts to blow the whistle on [[radioactive]] contamination and challenge official claims that British atomic tests posed no threat to the Australian people. Marston's findings are not only disputed, he is targeted as 'a scientist of counter-espionage interest'.

The '''Sobibór trial''' was a judicial trial directly concerning the [[Sobibór extermination camp]] personnel.  The trial was held in 1965–66 in [[Hagen]],&lt;ref name="Bryant1"/&gt; [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="Urteil LG Hagen"/&gt; It was one of a series of similar [[war crime]] trials held during the early 1960s, such as the Jerusalem [[Adolf Eichmann]] trial of 1961 and the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]] of 1963–65, as a result of which the general public came to realize the extent of the crimes that some twenty years earlier had been perpetrated in [[occupied Poland]] by Nazi bureaucrats and their executioners. In the same and in subsequent years, separate trials dealt with personnel of the [[Bełżec extermination camp|Belzec]] (1963–65), [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] (1964–65), and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (1975–81) [[extermination camp]]s.

==The trial==
Investigator Dietrich Zeug from Ludvigsburg, in charge of preparing the documents to be put before the court at the trial, studied old files and in the process stumbled upon a vast selection of individuals never before investigated. Some key ''SS'' officers who had served at Sobibór were tried over a decade earlier, such as ''[[SS-Oberscharführer]]'' Hubert Gomerski acquitted in the [[euthanasia trials]] of 1947, but sentenced again in 1950 and serving at Butzbach.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (2014), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARC-2006"&gt;ARC (24 January 2006), [http://www.deathcamps.org/sobibor/sobibortrials.html  Sobibor Trials] ''Aktion Reinhard Camps.''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeug asked the authorities for help, and by spring 1960 had identified three dozen men directly involved in [[Action T4]] and in Operation Reinhard. He contacted the World Jewish Congress and [[Yad Vashem]] in the following months, and on 23 June 1960 filed his first letter of recommendations at the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations,&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Zeug (9 June 1960), ''"Operation Reinhard."

''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review'', 339 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwigsburg officials learned for the first time about the whereabouts of some of the suspects in August 1960. [[Kurt Bolender]] lived under a false name in Hamburg and was identified in 1961. [[Karl Frenzel]] was caught in March 1962 in Göttingen.

The German court in Hagen initiated proceedings on 6 September 1965 against twelve former members of the ''SS'' camp personnel (about a quarter of the ''[[SS]]'' men employed at Sobibór ), accusing them of crimes against humanity.  The verdicts were pronounced on 20 December 1966,&lt;ref name="sobibor-archive"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080504213347/http://www.sobibor.info/murderers.html Sobibor - The Forgotten Revolt: Murderers.] 2014 Thomas T.

===Proceedings===
In the 1965–66 trial, the defendants claimed that once assigned to serve at a death camp, they saw no possibility to refuse their orders, citing the statement made by [[Christian Wirth]] to the personnel at Sobibór (quote): "If you do not like it here, you can leave, but under the earth, not over it."  However, ''SS-Untersturmführer'' Johann Klier, who asked to be transferred from Sobibór on moral grounds was not punished but allowed to leave, which proved that the contrary was true.&lt;ref name="ARC-2006"/&gt;

[[Image:Hermann Erich Bauer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|SS executioner [[Erich Bauer]]]]
One of the worst murderers in Sobibór was ''SS-Oberscharführer'' [[Erich Bauer]], the gas chamber "meister".  He was tried 15 years earlier, recognised on the streets of Berlin by survivor Samuel Lerer in 1949. On 8 May 1950 Bauer was sentenced to death by a District Court in [[Berlin-Moabit]], but this was commuted to life in prison, as the death penalty had been abolished in West Germany.  Bauer died in the Tegel prison in Berlin in 1980.&lt;ref name="Klee230"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACWKeRF49UYC&amp;q=%22Erich+Bauer%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Erich%20Bauer%22&amp;f=false | title=SS-Oberscharführer Erich Bauer | publisher=Konecky Konecky | work="The Good Old Days": The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders | date=1991 | accessdate=8 February 2015 |author1=Ernst Klee |author2=Willi Dressen |author3=Volker Riess | pages=230–243 | ISBN=1568521332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the Ukrainian guards who served at Sobibór were brought to trial in the Soviet Union, including B. Bielakow, M. Matwijenko, I. Nikifor, W. Podienko, F. Tichonowski, Emanuel Schultz, and J. Zajcew. They were  convicted for treason against the state, found guilty of war-crimes and executed. In April 1963, at a court in Kiev where [[Alexander Pechersky]] was the chief prosecution witness, ten former Ukrainian guards were found guilty and executed.  One was sentenced to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Arad2018-B&gt;{{cite book | last=Arad | first=Yitzhak | title=The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Revised and Expanded Edition: Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-253-03447-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMNjDwAAQBAJ |chapter=Appendix B: The Fate of the Perpetrators of Operation Reinhard | pages=399-400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third Soviet trial was held in Kiev in June 1965, where three former death camp guards from Sobibór and Belzec, known as the [[Trawniki men]], were executed by a firing squad.&lt;ref name=Arad2018-B/&gt;

This article gives the '''timeline of the [[Great Recession]]''', which hit many developed economies in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]].

'''Note:''' The date indicated is that of the official announcement by the department or the public agency in charge of the measurement of the economic activity of the country. Thus, because of possible lags in the collection of statistics, it is possible that the chronological order of reports may not correspond to the actual order of events in recession.

==Definition of recession==
A [[recession]] is a period of two quarters of negative GDP growth. The countries listed are those that officially announced that they were in recession.

It is worth noting that some developed countries such as [[South Korea]] and [[Australia]] did not enter recession (indeed Australia contracted for the last quarter of 2008 only to grow 1% for the first half of 2009). [[Poland]], then considered to be an [[Emerging markets|emerging market]] country, also avoided the recession as a result of their strong domestic market, low private debt and flexible currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Poland became only EU nation to avoid recession|date=29 Jun 2010|first1=Fred|last1=Pleitgen|first2=Catriona|last2=Davies |work=CNN|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-29/world/poland.economy.recession_1_poland-transition-economies-eastern-europe|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701160136/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-29/world/poland.economy.recession_1_poland-transition-economies-eastern-europe|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 July 2012|accessdate=23 May 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

There were large increases in part-time employment in January, bringing it back to the level of six months earlier.

'''Vasanta Habba''' ({{lang-kn|ವಸಂತ ಹಬ್ಬ}}), which means ''spring festival'' in the [[Kannada]] language, is a cultural festival organised by the [[Nrityagram]] foundation in the city of [[Bangalore]], India. It is a very popular event and is considered the classical [[Woodstock]] of [[India]].&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-01-29/bangalore/27112291_1_yakshagana-bharat-natyam-neyveli|title=Vasanthahabba from Feb 2|work=Online Edition of The Times of India, dated 2004-01-29|publisher=The Times Internet Ltd|accessdate=2007-08-12|date=2002-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival, first held in the year 1990, was the brainchild of [[Protima Bedi]], the founder of [[Nrityagram]].&lt;ref name="vh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/02/06/stories/2003020600890100.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2003-02-06|title=A habba in Vasantha|author=Sonira Gulhati|accessdate=2007-08-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182415/http://thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/02/06/stories/2003020600890100.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is held in the premises of Nrityagram at [[Hesaraghatta]] in the outskirts of Bangalore and attracts the best musicians, dancers and cultural artists from across India.&lt;ref name="arti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/jan172004/metro1.asp|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2004-01-17|title=A spring in their step|author=Kavita Mandana|publisher=The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an audience of about 3000 in its inaugural year, the 2003 edition saw over 40,000 people attending the event. 

==Festival==
The festival is one-night festival which starts in the late evening and goes on till the early morning of the next day. It is held in the amphitheatre located in the premises of Nrityagram at Hesaragahatta, which is a small village located 35 kilometres from the city of Bangalore. There is no entry fee and the seats are available on a first-come basis. Due to this fact, the seats start filling up from the afternoon itself.&lt;ref name="vh"/&gt; The publicity for the festival is held in a unique manner by employing folk artists and other troupes who perform on the roads of Bangalore, which publicise the event and also act as a curtain-raiser for the festival. The event is organised with the help of volunteers who belong to the colleges in the city. Many like-minded people also contribute to the event by sponsoring food stalls at the venue, organising food for the artists and also providing cars and other automobiles for ferrying musicians and artists to the venue.&lt;ref name="vh"/&gt; The amphitheatre can accommodate about 3,000 people and large screens are provided outside the venue for people who could not get a seat in time.

==Chronology==
===2002===
Held on 2 Feb 2002, the artists who performed included [[Aruna Sairam]] (Carnatic vocal), the Warsi brothers, [[Ateeq Hussain Khan]] ([[Qawwali]]) and Suma Sudhindra (who introduced the Tarangini veena). This event was beamed live on [[Doordarshan]] and also received good coverage on other TV channels

===2003===
Performances in this edition of Vasanta Habba included a concert on the [[Mohan Veena]] by [[Grammy Award]] winner, Pandit [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt]], [[fusion music]] by Taufiq Querishi and [[qawwali]] by the Ateeq Hussain Khan Warsi brothers. This event was attended by over 40,000 people.

===2004===
Held on 7 Feb 2004, the artists who performed included the renowned saxophonist [[Kadri Gopalnath]] and the [[Carnatic music]] exponent, [[Bombay Jayashri]].

==Current Scenario==
The event was not held in the year 2005 because India was facing the after-effects of the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Habba was never held again and Nrityagram blamed it on a financial crisis. Since Nrityagram has not commented on the fate of Habba, it is assumed that the festival has been scrapped for good. Meanwhile, their dance ensemble has consistently received rave reviews and now go on frequent annual performance tours to the USA and other countries.&lt;ref name="crunch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/03/03/stories/2007030301100300.htm|title=Waiting for their spring|author=B.

[[File:Washington Cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|Washington Cemetery - eastern edge of cemetery #1, bordering Ocean Parkway]]
'''Washington Cemetery''' is an old, historical, and predominantly Jewish [[burial ground]] located at 5400 [[Bay Parkway (Brooklyn)|Bay Parkway]] in [[Mapleton, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.

Washington Cemetery was founded in 1850,&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{cite book|title=The Leonard Manual of the Cemeteries of New York and Vicinity|date=1901|publisher=J.H. Leonard|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=90–91|url=https://archive.org/stream/leonardmanualofc00leon#page/92/mode/2up|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a Jewish burial-ground as early as 1857. Brooklyn cemeteries came into existence due to the [[Rural Cemetery Act]] of 1847, which allowed for the construction of commercial cemeteries outside the city limits. This part of Kings County was not yet incorporated into the [[City of Brooklyn]], and the legislation resulted in the transformation of several large parcels of farmland into cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrooklynink.com/2011/03/28/24376-scarce-brooklyn-cemeteries/ The Brooklyn Ink]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cemetery configuration==
Washington Cemetery is made up of five "gated cemeteries" separated by several local Brooklyn streets. The cemetery office building is located on the grounds of Cemetery #1, which was the original cemetery, next to the [[Bay Parkway (IND Culver Line)|Bay Parkway]] station of the [[F (New York City Subway service)|F train]] of the [[New York City Subway]].

The founder of Washington Cemetery, James Arlington Bennet, is buried there, as are his wife and son. Bennet was born in New York, and was proprietor and principal of the Arlington House, an educational institution on [[Long Island]]. He usually is remembered as [[Joseph Smith]]'s first choice as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-Presidential]] running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1844|United States presidential election of 1844]], before Smith was assassinated. His surname is misspelled on his headstone, which reads, "Author of Bennett's Book Keeping &amp; Other Works. Founder of Washington Cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|35095011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cemetery #1===
Cemetery #1 is shaped like a pentagon, and bordered on three of its sides by major Brooklyn streets: [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]], Bay Parkway, and McDonald Avenue. The main entrance and cemetery office building are on Bay Parkway just off McDonald Avenue. The interior of Cemetery #1 is crisscrossed by paths called Rose Avenue, Hyacinth Avenue, Jasmine Avenue, Aster Avenue, Lotus Avenue, and Evergreen Avenue. It has numerical posts from number one to number one hundred and forty-nine "A" (1–149A), sections marked "ranges". It has "society" sections, and burials are still occurring. It houses the majority of the [[mausoleum]]s and larger monuments. It is also the cemetery that in December 2010 sustained the majority of overturned and broken headstones because of vandals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/horror_show_vandals_target_washington_UEV7SNk8rDrTr4NgktP9CN New York Post Horror Show: Vandals target Washington Cemetery, toppling 200 headstones]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 200 headstones were overturned and are still not upright. Although there are concrete walkways, grave markers are very closely positioned in some areas, and visitors are sometimes forced to walk on grass.

===Cemetery #2===
Cemetery #2 is located across from Cemetery #1 and the office building. It is triangular, bounded on two of its sides by major thoroughfares - McDonald Avenue on the northeast and Bay Parkway on the northwest - and has four exits and entrances. Cemetery posts are numbered 150 to 237. It also is crisscrossed by paths, and houses society sections. Its named paths are Cedar Avenue, Maple Avenue, and Cypress Avenue.

===Cemetery #3===
Cemetery #3 is located across Bay Parkway directly across from Cemetery #2. It is bounded by Bay Parkway on its southeast and 21st Avenue on its northwest. It has five entrances and exits, and numbered posts from 231 to 333. Its named paths are Orange Avenue, Sycamore Avenue, Spruce Avenue, Aspen Avenue, and Balsam Avenue.

===Cemetery #4===
Cemetery #4 is directly across 21st Avenue from Cemetery #3, bounded by 21st Avenue on its southeast and 20th Avenue on its northwest, and has numbered posts are 334 to 462. It has five entrance and exits, and paths named are Walnut Avenue, Ash Avenue, Tulip Avenue, Iris Avenue, and Pine Avenue.

===Cemetery #5===
Cemetery #5 is directly across Cemetery #4, and bounded by 20th Avenue on its southeast. Its numbered posts run from 464 to 519. Oak Avenue, Magnolia Avenue, Arcadia Avenue, and Birch Avenue are its named paths. It has sections with four numbers on its west side.

'''World [[Philosophy]] Day''' was proclaimed by [[UNESCO]] to be celebrated every 3rd Thursday of November. It was first celebrated on 21 November 2002. 

By celebrating '''World Philosophy Day''' each year, on the third Thursday of November, [[UNESCO]] underlines the enduring value of philosophy for the development of human thought, for each culture and for each individual. UNESCO has always been closely linked to philosophy, not speculative or normative philosophy, but critical questioning which enables it to give meaning to life and action in the international context.

In '''establishing World Philosophy Day in 2005''', UNESCO’s General Conference highlighted the importance of this discipline, especially for young people, underlining that “philosophy is a discipline that encourages [[critical thinking|critical]] and independent thought and is capable of working towards a better understanding of the world and promoting tolerance and peace”. 
UNESCO's General Conference was convinced that “the [[institutionalisation]] of Philosophy Day at UNESCO as ‘World Philosophy Day’ would win recognition for and give strong impetus to philosophy and, in particular, to the [[philosophy education|teaching of philosophy]] in the world”.
