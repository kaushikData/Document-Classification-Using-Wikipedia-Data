'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilites are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Hirvensalo, Mirja, Taina Rantanen, and Eino Heikkinen. "Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al. "Value of functional status as a predictor of mortality: results of a prospective study." The American journal of medicine 93.6 (1992): 663-669., Manton, Kenneth G. "A longitudinal study of functional change and mortality in the United States." Journal of Gerontology 43.5 (1988): S153-S161., Khokhar, Shafiq R., et al. "Persistent mobility deficit in the absence of deficits in activities of daily living: a risk factor for mortality." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care &amp; Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.&lt;/ref&gt; but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

The '''British Medical Association''' ('''BMA''') is the [[professional association]] and registered [[trade union]] for [[physician|doctors]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The association does not regulate or certify doctors, a responsibility which lies with the [[General Medical Council]]. The association’s headquarters are located in BMA House, [[Tavistock Square]], [[London]]. Additionally, the association has national offices in [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], and [[Edinburgh]], a European office in [[Brussels]] and a number of offices in English regions. The BMA has a range of representative and scientific committees and is recognised by [[National Health Service]] (NHS) employers as sole contract negotiators for doctors.

The BMA's stated aim is ''"to promote the medical and allied sciences, and to maintain the honour and interests of the medical profession"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartrip|first=Peter|year=2007|title=A long way from Worcester|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=335|issue= 7610|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/bmj.39269.717454.59|pmc=1914517|pmid=17626958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Currently 156,000 doctors and 19,000 medical students are members of the association. It is officially recognised by the British government and by the [[Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration]]. The BMA shares national bargaining rights with the HCSA.

Members of the BMA have access to expert employment advice. Advisors can help with a range of employment related issues, from answering a simple question to advising on more complex problems including contract checking, job planning, pay disputes and relationship issues.

Members are also entitled to free resources from the BMA's wholly owned subsidiary, BMJ, including a free subscription to '''The BMJ'''.

==BMA committees==


As part of the representative remit of the BMA it has a number of representative committees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/about-us/get-involved/about-us|title=Tell me about the BMA|website=Bma.org.uk|date=21 August 2015|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed from members elected at the Annual Representatives Meeting (ARM) and via other election processes. The most senior of these is Council. It meets five times a year to implement policy as decided at the ARM and to take relevant decisions during the year. Council has 34 voting members, led by the Chairman who is elected by council for an initial term of three years and to a maximum of five.

The Board of Professional Activities reports to Council and considers ethical, scientific, research, and educational matters whilst The Board of Representative and Political Activities considers reports from the following committees which represent doctors across the seven branches of practice which are:

*Central Consultants and Specialists Committee (CCSC) – representing senior hospital doctors
*General Practitioners Committee (GPC) – representing NHS General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees throughout their training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/how-we-work/negotiating-committees/general-practitioners-committee/gp-trainees-subcommittee|title=GP trainees subcommittee|website=Bma.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411175247/http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/how-we-work/negotiating-committees/general-practitioners-committee/gp-trainees-subcommittee|archivedate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) – representing junior hospital doctors
*Medical Academic Staff Committee (MASC) – representing academic and research staff
*Medical Students Committee (MSC) – representing medical students
*Public Health Medicine Committee (PHMC) – representing public and community health doctors
*Staff and Associate Specialists Committee(SASC) – for doctors in the non consultant career grades.

Branch of Practice committees have a majority of BMA members but may also include non-members. All members are elected. These UK committees are mirrored across the devolved nations of [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].

===Other committees===
The BMA also has a number of committees which represent other specialities and interests which affect its members, including:
* Medical Ethics
* Board of Medical Education
* Equality and Diversity Committee
* Pensions
* Armed Forces
* Civil and Public Services Committee
* International Committee
* Medico-Legal
* Occupational Health
* GP Trainees' Subcommittee&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/representation/branch_committees/general_prac/gptraineemembers.jsp] {{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical Ethics Committee===
The Medical Ethics Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ethics/index.jsp|title=Medical Ethics Committee|website=Bma.org.uk|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129220139/http://www.bma.org.uk/ethics/index.jsp|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidance to the association on current and developing issues in medical ethics. It is widely seen as one of the foremost authorities on ethical issues in the UK and international medical field. The committee debates issues of principle including those touching on:

* [[Medical ethics]]
* [[Medical law]]
* Ethical matters concerning the relationship between the medical profession, the public, and the state.

Issues considered by the committee include [[abortion]], [[organ donation]] and presumed consent, [[patient confidentiality]], and the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005|Mental Capacity Act]].

The committee has eighteen members, composed of both doctors and expert lay members. Seven doctors who are members of the BMA are elected at the BMA's Annual Representatives Meeting (ARM) each year and three are elected by the BMA’s governing committee, BMA Council, which also appoints four external members "drawn from disciplines such as moral philosophy, natural sciences or law." The Committee itself co-opts an additional four expert members, drawn from similar disciplines. The co-opted members do not have voting rights. The Committee cannot by itself set BMA policy, although it develops its own policy which has advisory status.

The Medical Ethics Department, which provides support to the Committee, answers individual ethical enquiries from doctors who are members of the BMA and produces guidelines and other publications. The bulk of the Department’s guidance is freely available on the open access part of the BMA's website.

===Armed Forces Committee===
The BMA supports armed forces doctors through its Armed Forces Committee (AFC) which represents clinicians in all parts of the armed forces, whether they are deployed to war zones, acting as reservists or civilian doctors employed by the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/how-we-work/negotiating-committees/armed-forces-committee|title=Armed Forces Committee|website=Bma.org.uk|publisher=BMA|accessdate=16 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525085528/http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/how-we-work/negotiating-committees/armed-forces-committee|archivedate=25 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the AFC's work is the production of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The AFPRB advises on remuneration for members of the naval, military, and air forces. Further to this work, the AFC negotiates with the Ministry of Defence on the terms and conditions for civilian doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wlu/SGOY-7KQD7S?OpenDocument&amp;vw=wfmmsBMA|title=Comment on new pay deal for Civilian GPs employed by the MOD|website=Web2.bma.org.uk|date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee holds two conferences a year; an Armed Forces Committee conference usually in May and a Civilian Doctors' conference usually in October.

===Private Practice Committee===
The BMA supports doctors that undertake private practice outside the NHS through its Private Practice Committee. This body considers topics facing both private consultants and general practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/how-we-work/professional-activities-and-special-interest/private-practice-committee|title=BMA – Private practice committee (PPC)|website=Bma.org.uk|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee meets three times a year and holds conferences in relation to private practice. The main issues currently being dealt with by the committee include looking at the implementation of revalidation in the independent sector and addressing difficulties that doctors experience in relation to new ways of working by the private medical insurers.

==History==
[[File:British Medical Assoc logo 1897.jpg|left|thumb|Logo used for the BMA's Sixty-fifth Annual Meeting, Montreal, 1897]]
The British Medical Association was founded as the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (PMSA) by [[Charles Hastings (surgeon)|Sir Charles Hastings]] on 19 July 1832 at a meeting in the Board Room of the Worcester Infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/about_bma/history/BMAOutlineHistory.jsp]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now the site of the [[University of Worcester]]'s City Campus. An audience of 50 doctors was present to hear Hastings propose the inauguration of an Association both friendly and scientific for the sharing of knowledge between doctors. Ten years after its initial meeting the association’s membership had grown to 1350 and it had begun to publish a weekly journal, ''The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal'', known from 1857 as the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' or ''BMJ''. The association’s membership grew rapidly and in 1853 the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association extended its membership to London doctors and became the British Medical Association in 1856. Medical students have been admitted from the late 1970s onwards.

Although not initially formed with the aim of initiating medical reform, the BMA played a key role in the drafting and passing of the [[Medical Act 1858]], which established the [[General Medical Council]] and set a standard for qualified and unqualified doctors and established a system of professional regulation. Prior to this anyone, qualified or not, could practice as a doctor. This also positioned the BMA to play a major role in future medical politics, campaigning on issues such as [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] Medicine, [[quackery]], [[public health]], [[alternative medicine|alternative]] and military medicine, and contract practice. During this time one of the most active and influential of the association’s bodies was the Parliamentary Bills Committee, formed in 1863 to take a leading role in influencing legislation on public health matters.

==Headquarters==
[[File:BMA House.JPG|right|thumb|200px|BMA House, London]]
BMA House has been the headquarters of the BMA since 1925, the association being originally housed at 429 The [[Strand, London]], since its move to London. The building, now [[Grade II listed]], was originally designed for the [[Theosophical Society]] by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] with work commencing on 3 September 1911. However the start of [[World War I]] interrupted construction and the Army Pay Office took over the uncompleted building. After the war the Theosophical Society could not afford to finish the building, and it was sold to the BMA for £50,000, with the association later purchasing the freehold of the site from the [[The Bedford Estate|Bedford Estates]] in 1962.

After purchasing the building, the BMA commissioned Lutyens to complete the building to its specifications. The building was officially opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] on 13 July 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f5lAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5161%2C1704461 |title=British Medical Association. The King opens new headquarters. |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|date=14 July 1925 |page=8 |accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plans were soon commissioned from Cyril Wontner Smith to extend the building to overlook [[Tavistock Square]]. The association later commissioned [[Douglas Wood (architect)|Douglas Wood]] to design two more extensions on either side of Wontner Smith’s front entrance (build 1938–1950) and one at the back of the building (build 1959–1960).

==Early 20th century==
In May 1911 the Government introduced the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Health Insurance Bill]] which presented the BMA with new challenges. This bill introduced the idea that for a maximum contribution of four pence a week every employed person in the country could be insured against treatment costs for sickness. The BMA supported the principle but had a number of reservations about the scheme including the lack of doctor involvement in delivering the medical benefits, which were instead being delivered by friendly societies and trade unions. In response the BMA produced "Six Cardinal Points" which it felt should be included in any legislation.

At the BMA's general meeting in July 1912, incoming president [[James Barr (physician)|Sir James Barr]] condemned the National Health Insurance Bill as "the most gigantic fraud which had ever been perpetrated on the public since the South Sea Bubble." Addressing "a large and distinguished audience," Barr "spoke eloquently and forcibly in favour of the improvement of the race by attention to eugenics, and pointed out the necessity of preventing disease as well of curing it. No serious attempt, he said, had yet been made to prevent the race from being carried on by its least worthy citizens." Barr explained that: "If such an attempt was to be successful we must begin with the unborn. The race must be renewed from the mentally and physically fit, and moral and physical degenerates should not be allowed to take any part in adding to it".&lt;ref&gt;Doctors' Ultimatum to Ministers, ''The Times'', 24 Jul 1912:7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the final bill was passed in 1913 in which four of the six points had been included. This resulted in an income limit of £2 per week being set to join the scheme, there was to be free choice of doctor by patient, the payment to the doctor should be adequate, and finally there should be adequate medical representation among the various bodies working on the Act.

With the start of World War I, the BMA formed a Central Medical War Committee (CMWC), and was given responsibility by the government for managing the demand for doctors in the armed forces whilst maintaining a full medical service for civilians. The BMA repeated this role during [[World War II]]. During this time the BMA also campaigned on issues such as the production and marketing of "secret remedies", [[nutrition]] and [[physical fitness]], the relationship of [[alcohol]] to [[traffic collision|road accidents]], and the medical aspects of [[abortion]].

Early in the Second World War, the BMA became aware of the need for a change in the provision of medical care to the public after the end of the war and during peace time, so shortly after the war, the BMA had produced its own plan for a "general medical service for the nation". The plan had a number of revisions incorporating the latest BMA policy on various aspects of health care and in 1942 the Annual Representatives meeting approved a proposal for a state system "for the whole community" as suggested by the BMA's Medical Planning Commission. Later in 1942 the [[Beveridge Report]] announced a comprehensive national health service was to be established. The White paper "A National Health Service" was published on 17 February 1944.

==Establishment of the NHS==
Although the BMA agreed in principle with the establishment of the NHS, the BMA objected to the administration methods and the lack of consultation and negotiation with doctors regarding the scheme and the effects that the NHS would have on doctors' lives.

By 1945 a negotiating committee was set up and by 15 December 1945 it had announced seven principles with which the proposed service should comply if it were to be supported by the profession. The seven principles were;
# No salaried service
# Clinical freedom
# Free choice of doctor for patients
# Free choice for doctors of form and place of work
# Freedom of every registered practitioner to join the public service
# A hospital service centred on universities
# Adequate professional representation on all administrative bodies

Having gained a number of concessions from the government, the National Health Services Bill was published on 20 March 1946 and became law on 6 November 1946. The BMA conducted a referendum of its members to consider the Act. After 3 votes and a Special Representatives Meeting, the BMA Council recommended that the profession cooperate in the new health service and the NHS came into operation on 5 July 1948. The BMA has continued to play an important role in the NHS, specially in the negotiation of doctor’s terms and conditions. The association also made a number of significant contributions to high-profile government reports during the 1950s and 60s, such as the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951) and the [[Wolfenden Committee]] (1955).

==Current role in the reform of the NHS==
The BMA continued to play an ongoing role in the reform of the NHS by contributing to a number of reports since the founding of the NHS. The Royal Commission on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (1956) had important implications for general practitioners' pay, and was followed by a second inquiry – The Medical Services Review Committee. The report from this committee, known as the Porritt report was published in 1962 and included important recommendations for reforming the NHS administration, in particular the formation of area health boards. The third committee on General Practice was set up in 1961 under [[Annis Gillie]] and was charged with examining the future of General Practice. Its report was published in 1963. In 1965 the BMA published its General Medical Services Committee paper "A Charter for the Family Doctor Service".

The BMA continued to actively contribute to public health issues. The BMA's "Policy in Relation to Smoking" was published in 1971. In response to the perceived threat of nuclear war in the early 1980s, the association reported on the possible medical and environmental effects of global conflict. The BMA's first statement on [[AIDS]] was published in 1985 following the worldwide spread of the disease.

In 1989 the association rejected [[Kenneth Clarke]]'s [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990|reforms of the NHS]] based on an internal market. Led by its chairman [[John Marks (doctor)|John Marks]] it mounted a public relations campaign involving newspaper advertising, a poster campaign, the issue of 11 million pamphlets for distribution by general practitioners, and radio and television broadcasts which were critical of the government's proposal. Clarke later conceded that the association won the public relations exercise.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The government's legislation creating the internal market was implemented through the 1990 National Health Service and Community Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/19/contents/enacted|title=National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990|website=Legislation.gov.uk|date=1990|accessdate=19 October 2017|postscript=: Original version, as enacted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the genetic engineering working party culminated in the publication "Our Genetic Future", which considered the scientific and ethical implications of genetic engineering.

By the late 1980s, the BMA continued to negotiate contracts on behalf of doctors, some of them controversial{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. It has voiced concerns over the impact of [[European Union]] directives on the profession, [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution in the UK]], new technological sources for medical advice, and many other aspects of issues affecting patients and the working lives of doctors.

==Policy and the Representative Body==
As a democratic organisation, members decide BMA policy through the major policy making body, the Representative Body, which meets annually at the Annual Representatives Meeting (ARM). Membership of this body is approximately 600 and is elected both geographically and by branch of practice. Motions debated at the ARM come largely from BMA divisions (local bodies representing doctors) however they may also come from Branch of Practice or national committees.

Branches of practice also have annual conferences that pass policy.

'''Bugchasing''', also known in slang as '''charging''', is the practice of pursuing [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals in order to contract HIV. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers. It is a form of [[self-harm]]. Bugchasers seek [[sexual partner]]s who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having [[Bareback (sex)|unprotected sex]] and becoming HIV-positive; '''giftgivers''' are HIV-positive individuals who comply with the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV.

Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers engage in the activity for the excitement and intimacy inherent in pursuing such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A.

Some people consider bugchasing "intensely erotic" and the act of being infected through the "fuck of death" as the "ultimate taboo, the most extreme sex act left."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory A.

Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt; It has also been used as a form of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere | title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656| doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. | title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442| doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440 | pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

By design, bug chasing involves [[unprotected sex]], but members of the [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] subculture are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent:

{{quote|text=In reviewing the scarce unpublished and published materials on bugchasing, as well as general healthcare speculations, a common theme appears — the lumping of bug chasers with barebackers.... Although these two groups share some of the same practices, namely unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), there are distinctions that differentiate bug chasing...even though all bug chasers are indeed barebackers, not all barebackers are bugchasers.&lt;ref name="pmid17612955"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moskowitz DA, Roloff ME |title=The existence of a bug chasing subculture |journal=Cult Health Sex |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17612955 |doi=10.1080/13691050600976296 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13691050600976296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In simple terms, bugchasers engage in unprotected intercourse, and seek out partners with HIV, because they desire infection. Barebackers engage in unprotected intercourse because they prefer the sensation of it but generally prefer to avoid contracting STIs. While actual activity is the same for both groups the two do not share the same psychology. Barebackers conceptually have the same motivation as heterosexual couples that use non-barrier methods of birth control (more enjoyable sex), and, in contrast with bugchasers, do not deliberately seek HIV-infected partners.

As many "bugchasers" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with [[Munchausen syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Dr Mark|title=Contract Killing: A brief look at ‘bug chasing’|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201410/contract-killing|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.Gauthier|first=Deann|last2=J.Forsyth|first2=Craig|date=1999-01-01|title=bareback sex, bug chasers, and the gift of death|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016396299266605|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=20|issue=1|pages=85–100|doi=10.1080/016396299266605|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew [[condom]]s and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV.

Dr. Richard Tewksbury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewksbury|first=Richard|date=2003-09-01|title=bareback sex and the quest for HIV: assessing the relationship in internet personal advertisements of men who have sex with men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713840245|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=467–482|doi=10.1080/713840245|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the [[Internet]] to assist their [[Seroconversion|seroconversive]] efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics.

Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bug Chasing and Gift Giving: The Potential for HIV Transmission Among Barebackers on the Internet|last1=Grov|first1=Christian|last2=Parsons|first2=Jeffrey T.|date=2006|doi=10.1521/aeap.2006.18.6.490|journal=AIDS Education and Prevention|volume=18|issue=6|pp=490–503|pmid=17166076}}&lt;/ref&gt; research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers.

# "The Committed Bug Chaser" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent [[anal sex|anal receptive]]). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers.
# "The Opportunistic Bug Chaser" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner’s HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning [[anal receptive]] and [[anal insertive]]) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers.
# "The Committed Gift Giver" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category.
# "The Opportunistic Gift Giver" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner’s status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample.
# "The Serosorter" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their [[User profile|Internet profile]], behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were [[serosorting]] for partners of similar HIV status.
# "The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample.

In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers.

Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely [[sex addict]]s. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk-oriented high.

Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Exploratory Study of  Bug Chasers|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20321517|journal=Sociological imagination|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1077-5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge "common sense" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens.  Few respondents identified "getting it over with" as a motivating factor.

Some limited identification of becoming part of the "community" or "brotherhood" was identified.  Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical response==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Bugchasing has, more recently, been taken more seriously by medical health promotion bodies, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control]], which hosted a workshop on the topic, hosted by Dr. Michael Graydon of [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa]], at the 2004 National [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] Prevention Conference.

==In mainstream media==
The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304003441/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|archivedate=2008-03-04|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|title=In Search of Death|author=Gregory A. Freeman|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 December 2009|date=23 January 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Roeper&gt;{{Cite news| title = What makes bug chasers, gift givers do such a thing? | first = Richard | last = Roeper | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2003-04-22 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya&gt;{{Cite news| title = A new generation rethinks AIDS risk | page = 1D |department=Island Life | newspaper = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 2003-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but ''Rolling Stone'' stands behind the story.&lt;ref name = Roeper/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = n TRANSMISSION |journal= AIDS Policy and Law |volume= 18 |issue= 4 | date = 2003-03-03 | publisher = LRP Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mnookin&gt;{{Cite news| title = Using 'Bug Chasers' | page = 10 | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | publisher = Newsweek | date = 2003-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's [[Fenway Health|Fenway Community Health]], was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bugged&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bugged Out Over AIDS Story | page = 10 | publisher = New York Post | date = 2003-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the statements "entirely a fabrication," but ''Rolling Stone'' also stood behind them.&lt;ref name = Bugged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated? | newspaper = Newsweek | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | date = 2003-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weinstein, then editor of the ''New York Blade'', an established gay newspaper, called the article "less than truthful" and attributed it to a ''Rolling Stone'' editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing "lad mag" who wished to make a sensation for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Steve | title = Chasing the bug chasers [editorial] | journal = Washington Blade | date = May 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the article, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] put out an action alert, calling its members to "PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Savage Love |department=Hot Spot | page = 171 | authorlink = Dan Savage | first = Dan | last = Savage | newspaper = The Village Voice | date = 2003-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Men Who Want AIDS | first = Matthew | last = Laza | pages = 21–24 | newspaper = The Spectator | date = 2003-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to cut down on its AIDS funding.&lt;ref name = Mnookin/&gt;

Writer/[[film director|director]] Daniel Bort made a [[2003 in film|2003]] short film  on the subject called ''Bugchaser'', which premièred at the 16th Annual [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in [[New York City|New York]] [[sex club]]s. In an interview with the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', he explained: ''"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way."'' At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Gift (2003 film)|The Gift]]'' by Louise Hogarth.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 [[BBC]] programme, ''I love being HIV+'', said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising.&lt;ref name="HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4895012.stm|title=HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? |accessdate=2008-07-06|publisher=BBC News|author=Richard Pendry   | date=2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, "Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy." The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, "The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, "There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asked Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience "the gift". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the NBC series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', Season 7, Episode 13, Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asked the HIV-negative patient if he is "bug chasing".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter [[Marc with a C]] has a song on the subject entitled "Chasing the Bug".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2587">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Cuba]]''', however it is seldom used. The last executions were in 2003. National legislation provides for death penalty for [[murder]], threatening to commit murder, aggravated [[rape]], [[terrorism]], hijacking, piracy, drug trafficking and manufacturing, [[espionage]], and [[treason]]. The typical method is [[execution by firing squad]].&lt;ref name=wcatdp&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Penalty Worldwide|url=http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Cuba|website=The Death Penalty Worldwide database|publisher=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[1940 Constitution of Cuba]] banned capital punishment for peacetime offenses, but the penalty was officially reinstated by law as well as in practice following the [[Cuban Revolution]], in 1959. Sources suggest many more have been executed since 1959, compared to official statistics. The last sentences were commuted in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubaverdad.net/genocide.htm#Other Sources:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.se/vad-gor-vi/dodsstraffet/dodsstraffet-i-varlden/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202224915/http://www.amnesty.se/vad-gor-vi/dodsstraffet/dodsstraffet-i-varlden/ |archivedate=2011-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2886.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last recorded executions were on April 11, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cuba-executes-three-men-for-ferry-hijacking-594227.html when three men were executed by firing squad for ferry hijacking - Americas, Worls - The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned three men who were found guilty of [[Piracy|having hijacked]] a [[Regla]] [[ferry]]. The hijack occurred on April 4? 2003; during the incident, the plaintiffs were alleged to have threatened to kill passengers, demanding sufficient fuel to travel to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapreport.com/citysubtopics/cuba-c-v.html Cuba, Hijack Timeline, 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2915671.stm BBC NEWS | Americas | Cuba ferry hostages released]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the sentences of all remaining death row inmates in Cuba were commuted. To date, no further death sentences have been handed out.

[[File:Hierbas aromaticas.JPG|thumb|right|Care farming]]
'''Care farming''' is the use of farming practices for the stated purpose of providing or promoting healing, mental health, social, or educational care services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carefarminguk.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CareFarmingScotland.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}} Care farms may provide supervised, structured programs of farming-related activities, including animal husbandry, crop and vegetable production and woodland management.&lt;ref&gt;National Care Farming Initiative (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}} 
Some farms attempt to alleviate the effects of the unrecognized medical condition [[nature deficit disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;SanctuaryOne.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}}

==History==
Recently, agricultural multifunctionality has given a boost to the development of care farming.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[Benjamin Rush]] (1746–1813) is said to be one of the first medical scientists referring to the positive effects of the practice of horticultural therapy on the well-being of mentally diseased.{{by whom|date=September 2018}} Rush published 5 books in a series of Medical Inquiries and Observations, the last being concerned with The Diseases of The Mind (1812). In this volume, the practice of horticulture is mentioned twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/ccfr/growing_together/Dr%20Rush%20and%20Therapeutic%20Horticulture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626232346/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/ccfr/growing_together/Dr%20Rush%20and%20Therapeutic%20Horticulture.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} 

&lt;blockquote&gt; It has been remarked, that the maniacs of the male sex in all hospitals, who assist in cutting wood, making fires, and digging in a garden, and the females who are employed in washing, ironing, and scrubbing floors, often recover, while persons, whose rank exempts them from performing such services, languish away their lives within the walls of the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, B. (1812) Medical Inquiries upon Diseases of the Mind, The History of Medicine Series, No 15, New York: Hafner Publishing Company, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of farms==
Farm types range from dairy farms to poultry farms, from livestock keeping for meat production to manege / horse riding schools, from orchards and vineyards to market gardens.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Care farms may be large scale or small scale, both in terms of agricultural production as well as in number of clients for the care services provided. In general however, there are less care farmers to be found in large scale, intensive, [[industrial agriculture]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A significant number of care farms focus on [[organic farming]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

Because care farms participate in market-oriented agricultural productivity (providing agricultural produce for the market), there are numerous care farms where the farm activities are subservient to the therapeutic process.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Depending on what the focus of the farm is, the activities that are offered on the farm may depend on the type of clients the farm targets or the type of available agricultural processes on the farm.

Some care farms serve as [[Animal sanctuary|animal sanctuaries]] to provide homes for formerly abused animals.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

BABY MANJI YAMADA v. UNION OF INDIA &amp; ANR. [2008] INSC 1656 (29 September 2008). Baby Manji was born at [[Akanksha Infertility Clinic]].

The girl, who was born in late July, arrived at Kansai International Airport from India, accompanied by her 70-year old grandmother Emkio Yamada.

==''Balaz v. India''==

In ''Jan Balaz v Union of India'', the [[Gujarat High Court]] conferred [[Indian nationality law|Indian citizenship]] on two twin babies fathered through compensated surrogacy by a German national in [[Anand district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Express News Service | author-link = Express News (Pakistan) | title = HC confers Indian citizenship on twins fathered through surrogacy | url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/hc-confers-indian-citizenship-on-twins-fathered-through-surrogacy/540419/ | work = [[The Indian Express]] | location =  Ahmedabad | date = 12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court observed: "We are primarily concerned with the rights of two newborn, innocent babies, much more than the rights of the biological parents, surrogate mother, or the donor of the [[Ovum|ova]]. Emotional and legal relationship of the babies with the surrogate mother and the donor of the ova is also of vital importance." The court considered the surrogacy laws of countries like Ukraine, Japan, and the United States.

Balaz, the petitioner, submitted before the Supreme Court that he shall be submitting his passports before the Indian Consulate in Berlin. He also agreed that a NGO in Germany shall respond back to India on the status of the children and their welfare. The Union of India responded that India shall make all attempts to have the children sent to Germany.

==Indian Council for Medical Research guidelines==
The [[Indian Council for Medical Research]] has given Guidelines in the year 2005 regulating Assisted Reproductive Technology procedures. The Law Commission of India submitted the 228th report on Assisted Reproductive Technology procedures discussing the importance and need for surrogacy, and also the steps taken to control surrogacy arrangements. The following observations had been made by the Law Commission:

#Surrogacy arrangement will continue to be governed by contract amongst parties, which will contain all the terms requiring consent of surrogate mother to bear child, agreement of her husband and other family members for the same, medical procedures of artificial insemination, reimbursement of all reasonable expenses for carrying child to full term, willingness to hand over the child born to the commissioning parent(s), etc. But such an arrangement should not be for commercial purposes.
#A surrogacy arrangement should provide for financial support for surrogate child in the event of death of the commissioning couple or individual before delivery of the child, or divorce between the intended parents and subsequent willingness of none to take delivery of the child.
#A surrogacy contract should necessarily take care of life insurance cover for surrogate mother.
#One of the intended parents should be a donor as well, because the bond of love and affection with a child primarily emanates from biological relationship. Also, the chances of various kinds of child-abuse, which have been noticed in cases of adoptions, will be reduced. In case the intended parent is single, he or she should be a donor to be able to have a surrogate child. Otherwise, adoption is the way to have a child which is resorted to if biological (natural) parents and adoptive parents are different.
#Legislation itself should recognize a surrogate child to be the legitimate child of the commissioning parent(s) without there being any need for adoption or even declaration of guardian.
#The birth certificate of the surrogate child should contain the name(s) of the commissioning parent(s) only.
#Right to privacy of donor as well as surrogate mother should be protected.
#Sex-selective surrogacy should be prohibited.
#Cases of abortions should be governed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 only.

== Surrogacy risk and conditions in India ==
According to ''The Guardian'', there was a mother who died because she didn't get the proper medical attention.&lt;ref name="Guardian_050612"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/05/india-surrogates-impoverished-die|title=India's surrogate mothers are risking their lives. They urgently need protection |last=Desai|first=Kishwar|date=5 June 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives estimates show that more than 25,000 children are now being born through surrogates in India every year in an industry worth $2 billion.&lt;ref name="Guardian_050612" /&gt; Domestic demand is increasing, but as fertility levels drop elsewhere, at least 50% of these  are "commissioned" by overseas, mainly western, couples.&lt;ref name="Guardian_050612" /&gt; Most of the industry is operating unchecked. India's medical research watchdog drafted regulations more than two years ago, yet they still await presentation in parliament, leaving the surrogates and baby factories open to abuse.&lt;ref name="Guardian_050612" /&gt; According to Dr. Manish Banker, from the Pulse Women's Hospital, reported to come back on a patient, "She suddenly had a convulsion and fell on the floor," he said. "We immediately took her for treatment. Since she was showing signs of distress, we conducted an emergency cesarean section delivery."&lt;ref name="Guardian_050612" /&gt;

==Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, 2013==

The Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, 2013 has a been pending for quite a while and it has not been presented in the Indian Parliament. It will not allow commercial surrogacy that involves exchange of money for anything other than paying for medical expenses for the mother and the child. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiawest.com/news/india/cabinet-approves-amendments-to-surrogacy-bill/article_47ca521e-2d48-11e8-9102-c7e671461a1c.html Cabinet Approves Amendments to Surrogacy Bill,

The bill would prohibit these from surrogacy: couples already having one child, foreigners or Overseas Citizens of India (OCI),  holders
as well as live-in-Partners, single people, homosexuals and widows.

Chopra studied medicine in India before emigrating to the United States in 1970 where he completed residencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. As a licensed physician, he became chief of staff at the [[New England Memorial Hospital]] (NEMH) in 1980.&lt;ref name="restless" /&gt; He met [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in 1985 and became involved with the [[Transcendental Meditation movement]] (TM). He resigned his position at NEMH shortly thereafter to establish the [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health|Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center]].&lt;ref name=baer2003 /&gt; Chopra gained a following in 1993 after he was interviewed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' about his books.&lt;ref name=dunkel2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunkel|first=Tom|title=Inner Peacekeeper|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-04-29/news/0504290067_1_deepak-chopra-chopra-and-dr-pillar-candles|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|year=2005|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then left the TM movement to become the executive director of [[Sharp HealthCare]]'s Center for Mind-Body Medicine and in 1996 he co-founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing.&lt;ref name="restless" /&gt;&lt;ref name=baer2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2012&gt;{{cite book|author=David Steele|title=The Million Dollar Private Practice: Using Your Expertise to Build a Business That Makes a Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vypmz76KeAC&amp;pg=PA26|date=September 11, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-22081-8|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra believes that a person may attain "perfect health", a condition "that is free from disease, that never feels pain", and "that cannot age or die".&lt;ref name=baerp240/&gt;&lt;ref name=perfect/&gt; Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a "quantum mechanical body" composed not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that "human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself," as determined by one's state of mind.&lt;ref name=baerp240/&gt;&lt;ref name=ageless/&gt; He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease.&lt;ref name=aids /&gt;&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005 /&gt; {{as of|2014}}, Deepak Chopra lived in a "health-centric" condominium in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=VM2014/&gt;

The ideas Chopra promotes have been regularly criticized by medical and scientific professionals as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=Tompkins2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightline /&gt;&lt;ref name=jaco/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie-Bullshit"/&gt; This criticism has been described as ranging "from dismissive [to] damning".&lt;ref name=Tompkins2008 /&gt; For example, [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] states Chopra attempts to integrate [[Ayurveda]] with [[quantum mechanics]] to justify his teachings.&lt;ref name="skepdic-web" /&gt; Chopra argues that what he calls "[[quantum healing]]" cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims&lt;!-- "these are his claims and basically no one else's" per edit summary for this revision--&gt; are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005/&gt; This has led physicists to object to his use of the term ''quantum'' in reference to medical conditions and the human body.&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005/&gt; His treatments generally elicit nothing but a [[placebo response]],&lt;ref name=Gamel2008/&gt; and have drawn criticism that the unwarranted claims made for them may raise "false hope" and lure sick people away from legitimate [[medical treatment]]s.&lt;ref name=Tompkins2008/&gt; He is placed by [[David Gorski]] among the "quacks", "cranks" and "purveyors of woo", and described as "arrogantly obstinate".&lt;ref name=Gorski2016/&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] has said that Chopra uses "quantum jargon as plausible-sounding [[Hocus pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/richard-dawkins-plays-god_b_3467484.html|title=Richard Dawkins Plays God: The Video (Updated)|first=Deepak|last=Chopra|date=June 19, 2013|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Chopra was born in New Delhi, India,&lt;ref name=Chamberlain2015&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/backstage-a-lesson-in-concentration-from-deepak-chopra-1.2082540|title=Backstage: A lesson in concentration from Deepak Chopra|last=Chamberlain|first=Adrian|date=October 10, 2015|work=[[Times Colonist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Krishan Lal Chopra (1919–2001) and Pushpa Chopra.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Chopra 2013, pp. 5, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the [[British Indian Army]]. His father was a prominent [[cardiologist]], head of the department of medicine and cardiology at New Delhi's Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospital for over 25 years; he was also a lieutenant in the British army, serving as an army doctor at the [[Burma Campaign|front at Burma]] and acting as a medical adviser to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], viceroy of India.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 2013, pp. 5–6, 11–13; {{cite news|title=The Chopra Brothers|author=Michael Schulder|url=http://cnnradio.cnn.com/2013/05/24/the-chopra-brothers/|publisher=CNN|date=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of |2014}} Chopra's younger brother, [[Sanjiv Chopra]], is a professor of medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]] and on staff at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.bidmc.org/Find_a_doc/doc_detail.asp?sid=41414643494642 "Chopra, Sanjiv, MD"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220044307/http://services.bidmc.org/Find_a_doc/doc_detail.asp?sid=41414643494642 |date=December 20, 2008 }}, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

While visiting New Delhi in 1981, he met the physician [[Brihaspati Dev Triguna]], head of the [[Central Council of Indian Medicine|Indian Council for Ayurvedic Medicine]], whose advice prompted him to begin investigating Ayurvedic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 1991, p. 105ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra was "drinking black coffee by the hour and smoking at least a pack of cigarettes a day".&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 1991, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up [[Transcendental Meditation]] to help him stop; {{as of|lc=y|2006}} he continued to meditate for two hours every morning and half an hour in the evening.&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosamund Burton |title=Peace Seeker |url=http://www.novamagazine.com.au/article_archive/2006/06_04_Peace%20seeker.htm |work=Nova Magazine |date=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105164338/http://www.novamagazine.com.au/article_archive/2006/06_04_Peace%20seeker.htm |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--update this--&gt;

Chopra's involvement with TM led to a meeting, in 1985, with the leader of the TM movement, [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], who asked him to establish an Ayurvedic health center.&lt;ref name=baer2003&gt;Baer 2003, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655336?seq=5 p. 237].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 1991, p. 139ff&lt;/ref&gt; He left his position at the NEMH. Chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs: "[W]hen all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn't mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit."&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, [http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/50186/ "The Crisis of Perception"], ''Media Monitors Network'', February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the founders of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, and medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The center charged between $2,850 and $3,950 a week for Ayurvedic cleansing rituals such as massages, [[enema]]s and oil baths; TM lessons cost an additional $1,000. Celebrity patients included [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Elise Pettus, "The Mind–Body Problems," ''New York'', August 14, 1995, ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 pp. 28–31], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 95]), p. 30.

In 1989 the Maharishi awarded him the title "Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth" ([[Dhanvantari]] is the Hindu physician to the gods).&lt;ref name=Humes2009p297&gt;[[Cynthia Ann Humes]], "Schisms within Hindu guru groups: the Transcendental Meditation movement in North America," in [[James R.

=== West Coast years ===
In June 1993, he moved to California as executive director of [[Sharp HealthCare]]'s Institute for Human Potential and Mind/Body Medicine, and head of their Center for Mind/Body Medicine, a clinic in an exclusive resort in [[Del Mar, California]] that charged $4,000 a week and included [[Michael Jackson]]'s family among its clients.&lt;ref name=Pettus1995p31&gt;Pettus (''New York Magazine'') 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31].&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra and Jackson first met in 1988 and remained friends for 20 years. When Jackson died in 2009 after being administered prescription drugs, Chopra said he hoped it would be a call to action against the "cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities".&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Chopra, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/a-tribute-to-my-friend-mi_b_221268.html "A Tribute to My Friend, Michael Jackson"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Huffington Post'', June 26, 2009; Gerald Posner, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-07-02/chopra-michael-jackson-could-have-been-saved/ "Deepak Chopra: How Michael Jackson Could Have Been Saved"], ''The Daily Beast'', July 2, 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consciousness ===
Chopra speaks and writes regularly about [[metaphysics]], including the study of consciousness and [[Vedanta]] philosophy. He is a philosophical [[Idealism|idealist]], arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for [[teleology]] and intelligence in nature – that mind, or "dynamically active consciousness", is a fundamental feature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Chopra, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scI9ZFImN8o "What Is Consciousness &amp; Where Is It?"], discussion with [[Rudolph E.

=== Approach to health care {{anchor|Quantum healing}}===
[[File:Deepak Chopra 2006 C.jpg|thumb|Deepak Chopra at a book signing in 2006]]
Chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body, with mental states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions and memories) directly influencing physiology by means of [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[dopamine]], [[oxytocin]] and [[serotonin]]. He has stated, "Your mind, your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions, your personal relationships, your environment, how you deal with the environment, and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … By influencing one, you influence everything."&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Chopra, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0IOf08pTRc "Deepak Chopra Meditation"], courtesy of YouTube, December 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra and physicians at the Chopra Center practise [[integrative medicine]], combining the [[medical model]] of conventional Western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga, [[mindfulness meditation]], and [[Ayurveda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/a-z-religion-index/deepak_chopra.htm|publisher=ReligionFacts.com|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oprah Winfrey &amp; Deepak Chopra Launch All-New Meditation Experience 'Expanding Your Happiness'|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Oprah-Winfrey-Deepak-Chopra-Launch-All-New-Meditation-Experience-Expanding-Your-Happiness-20140714|website=Broadway World|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ayurveda, illness is caused by an imbalance in the patient's ''[[dosha]]s'' or [[Humorism|humours]], and is treated with diet, exercise and meditative practices&lt;ref&gt;For imbalance, see Baer 2004, p. 128; for the rest, Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 222–224, 234ff.&lt;/ref&gt; – based on the [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] there is, however, nothing in Ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease, and some preparations may be actively harmful, although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing.&lt;ref name=cruk&gt;{{cite web |title=Ayurvedic medicine |publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]] |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/ayurvedic-medicine |accessdate=|quote=There is no scientific evidence to prove that Ayurvedic medicine can treat or cure cancer or any other disease.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing health care, Chopra has used the term "quantum healing", which he defined in ''Quantum Healing'' (1989) as the "ability of one mode of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body)".&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 15, 241; Deepak Chopra, [https://www.chopra.com/ccl/healing-wisdom "Healing wisdom"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521041812/https://www.chopra.com/ccl/healing-wisdom |date=May 21, 2014 }}, The Chopra Center, June 12, 2013.
* That he uses the term "quantum healing" as a metaphor, see Richard Dawkins, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsH1U7zSp7k "Interview with Chopra"], ''The Enemies of Reason'', [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-enemies-of-reason Channel 4 (UK)], 2007, 01:16 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;
This attempted to wed the Maharishi's version of Ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics, an example of what cultural historian Kenneth Zysk called "New Age Ayurveda".&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Newcombe, "Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in Good Faith," in Smith and Wujastyk 2008, pp. 263–264; Kenneth Zysk, "New Age Ayurveda or what happens to Indian medicine when it comes to America," ''Traditional South Asian Medicine'', 6, 2001, pp. 10–26. Also see Francoise Jeannotat, "Maharishi Ayur-veda," in Smith and Wujastyk 2008, p. 285ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The book introduced Chopra's view that a person's thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Zamarra, [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198912143212426 "Quantum Healing: Exploring the frontiers of mind/body medicine"], ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 321, December 14, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra coined the term ''quantum healing'' to invoke the idea of a process whereby a person's health "imbalance" is corrected by [[quantum mechanical]] means. Chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. He has attempted to integrate [[Ayurveda]], a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics, in order to justify his teachings. According to [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]], he "charges $25,000 per lecture performance, where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism".&lt;ref name="skepdic-web" /&gt;

Chopra has equated [[spontaneous remission]] in cancer to a change in quantum state, corresponding to a jump to "a new [[level of consciousness]] that prohibits the existence of cancer". Physics professor [[Robert L. Park]] has written that physicists "wince" at the "New Age quackery" in Chopra's cancer theories, and characterizes them as a cruel fiction, since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt, and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure.&lt;ref name=AshmanBarringer2005&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Keith|editor1-last=Ashman|editor2-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Barringer|title=After the Science Wars: Science and the Study of Science|chapter=Chapter 9: Voodoo medicine in a scientific world|first=Robert L|last=Park|authorlink=Robert L.

Chopra's claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a "systematic misinterpretation" of modern [[physics]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Brian |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/02/20/why-quantum-theory-is-so-misunderstood/ |title=Why Quantum Theory Is So Misunderstood – Speakeasy – WSJ |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra's connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid. The main criticism revolves around the fact that [[macroscopic]] objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like [[quantum interference|interference]] and [[wave function collapse]]. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]], omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes [[quantum electrodynamics]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aske-skeptics.org.uk/magic_of_quantum_physics.html |title='Magic' of Quantum Physics |publisher=Aske-skeptics.org.uk |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicists have objected to Chopra's use of terms from quantum physics; he was awarded the satirical [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1998 for "his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness".&lt;ref&gt;Park 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 p. 137]; {{cite journal| author=Victor J.

When Chopra and [[Jean Houston]] debated [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] and [[Michael Shermer]] in 2010 on the question "Does God Have a Future?", Harris argued that Chopra's use of "spooky physics" merged two [[Language-game (philosophy)|language games]] in a "completely unprincipled way".&lt;ref name=Nightline/&gt;
Interviewed in 2007 by [[Richard Dawkins]], Chopra said that he used the term ''quantum'' as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsH1U7zSp7k "Interview with Chopra"], ''[[The Enemies of Reason]]'', [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-enemies-of-reason Channel 4 (UK)], 2007; Deepak Chopra, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/richard-dawkins-plays-god_b_3467484.html "Richard Dawkins Plays God: The Video (Updated)"], ''The Huffington Post'', June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra wrote in 2000 that his [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on Ayurveda, including taking herbs, meditation and yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Dann Dulin, [http://www.danndulin.com/deepakchopra.html "The Medicine Man"], interview with Deepak Chopra, ''A&amp;U magazine'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges that AIDS is caused by the [[HIV virus]], but says that, "'[h]earing' the virus in its vicinity, the DNA mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound". Ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 37, 237, 239–241.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman writes that Chopra's treatment has "to put it mildly...no supporting empirical data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12964263|year=2003|author=Lawrence J.

In 2001, [[ABC News]] aired a show segment on the topic of [[distance healing]] and prayer.&lt;ref name=Wanjek2003 /&gt; In it Chopra said that "there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance".&lt;ref name=Wanjek2003 /&gt; Chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room, whose [[vital signs]] were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between Chopra's periods of concentration and the subject's periods of relaxation.&lt;ref name=Wanjek2003 /&gt; After the show, a poll of its viewers found that 90% of them believed in distance healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |first=Gary P |last=Posner |title=Hardly a Prayer on ABC's 20/20 Downtown |year=2001 |issue=November/December |url=http://www.gpposner.com/downtown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health and science journalist [[Christopher Wanjek]] has criticized the experiment, saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing, but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed. Wanjek characterized the broadcast as "an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news" which had "a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound".&lt;ref name=Wanjek2003&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher |last=Wanjek |title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O |series=Wiley Bad Science Series |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIJ5TKh7mPgC&amp;pg=PA224|year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-46315-3 |pages=224- |authorlink=Christopher Wanjek |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra has been described as "America's most prominent spokesman for Ayurveda".&lt;ref name=informed /&gt; His treatments benefit from the [[placebo response]].&lt;ref name=Gamel2008 /&gt; Chopra states "The placebo effect is real medicine, because it triggers the body's healing system."&lt;ref name=Chopra2012SFC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/chopra/article/I-Will-Not-Be-Pleased-Your-Health-and-the-3798901.php|title=I Will Not Be Pleased – Your Health and the Nocebo Effect|last=Deepak|first=Deepak|date=October 17, 2012 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician and former [[Flight surgeon|U.S. Air Force flight surgeon]] [[Harriet A.

Chopra has metaphorically described the AIDS virus as emitting "a sound that lures the DNA to its destruction". The condition can be treated, according to Chopra, with "Ayurveda's primordial sound".&lt;ref name=aids /&gt; Taking issue with this view, medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that, "to put it mildly, Dr. Chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for AIDS that has no supporting empirical data".&lt;ref name=aids&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12964263|year=2003|last1=Schneiderman|first1=LJ|title=The (alternative) medicalization of life|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–7|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2003.tb00080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopra believes that "ageing is simply learned behaviour" that can be slowed or prevented.&lt;ref name=mumbo&gt;{{cite news |title=Junk medicine; The triumph of mumbo jumbo |type=Book review |first=Mark |last=Henderson |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=February 7, 2004 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra has said that he expects "to live way beyond 100".&lt;ref name="Wheen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Wheen|title=How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short History of Modern Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjebcPiBdwC&amp;pg=PA46|date=July 6, 2005|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-0-7867-2352-2|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that "by consciously using our awareness, we can influence the way we age biologically...You can tell your body not to age."&lt;ref name="Quackwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/chopra.html |author=Stephen Barrett |authorlink=Stephen Barrett |title=A Few Thoughts on Ayurvedic Mumbo-Jumbo |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated, for example by a person engaging in "cynical mistrust".&lt;ref name=LoI&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Forbes |title=Lord of immortality |type=Book review |year=1994 |last=Moukheiber |first=Zina |volume=153 |issue=8 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has characterized Chopra's promotion of lengthened life as a selling of "hope" that seems to be "a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish".&lt;ref name="skepdic-web"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html |work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |first=Robert Todd |last=Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=Deepak Chopra |date=May 19, 2013 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirituality and religion ===
Chopra has likened the universe to a "reality sandwich" which has three layers: the "material" world, a "quantum" zone of matter and energy, and a "virtual" zone outside of time and space, which is the domain of God, and from which God can direct the other layers. Chopra has written that human beings' brains are "hardwired to know God" and that the functions of the [[human nervous system]] mirror divine experience.&lt;ref name=god&gt;{{cite journal |title=God as best seller: Deepak Chopra, Neal Walsch and New Age theology |author=Lois Malcolm |journal=The Christian Century |volume=120 |issue=19 |year=2003 |page=31}} ''commenting on'' {{cite book|author=Deepak Chopra|title=How To Know God|year= 2008|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4090-2220-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], a 20th-century speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Krishnamurti: 100 Years | last=Blau | first=Evelyne | page=233 | publisher=Stewart, Tabori, &amp; Chang |date=May 1995 | isbn=978-1-55670-407-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, reviewing ''[[War of the Worldviews]]''{{snds}}a book co-authored by Chopra and [[Leonard Mlodinow]]&amp;nbsp;– physics professor Mark Alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, "[covering] all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God". Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition, and says that "the counterpoint to Chopra's speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses," but rather [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is science the antidote to Deepak Chopra's spirituality? |first=Mark |last=Alford |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=2012 |page=54 |url=http://alford.fastmail.us/Chopra_Mlodinow_SI.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105184137/http://alford.fastmail.us/Chopra_Mlodinow_SI.html |archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the [[creation-evolution controversy]] and [[Intelligent design]], which were criticized by science writer [[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]].&lt;ref name="ChopEin"&gt;{{cite news | last=Chopra | first=Deepak | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/intelligent-design-withou_b_6105.html | title=Intelligent Design Without the Bible | work=The Huffington Post | date=August 23, 2005|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Shermer | first= Michael | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-shermer/skyhooks-and-cranes-deep_b_6179.html | title=Skyhooks and Cranes: Deepak Chopra, George W.

=== Position on skepticism ===
[[Paul Kurtz]], an American [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]], has written that the popularity of Chopra's views is associated with increasing anti-scientific attitudes in society, and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new, alternative forms of validation for ideas. Kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to open-minded but proper scrutiny, and that skepticism "has its work cut out for it".&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kurtz|title=Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q34zdaoq0xIC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3411-7|page=110|authorlink=Paul Kurtz|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Chopra published an article on what he saw as "skepticism" at work in Wikipedia, arguing that a "stubborn band of militant skeptics" were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as [[Rupert Sheldrake]], an author, lecturer, and researcher in [[parapsychology]]. The result, Chopra argued, was that the encyclopedia's readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to "expand science beyond its conventional boundaries".&lt;ref name=coyne&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jerry A|last=Coyne|authorlink=Jerry Coyne|title=Pseudoscientist Rupert Sheldrake Is Not Being Persecuted, And Is Not Like Galileo|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=November 8, 2013|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115533/rupert-sheldrake-fools-bbc-deepak-chopra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] responded, saying that it was instead Chopra who was losing out as his views were being "exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding [[psychobabble]]".&lt;ref name=coyne /&gt;

More broadly, Chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole, writing in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that "No skeptic, to my knowledge, ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others."&lt;ref name=perils&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Deepak |last=Chopra |title=The Perils of Skepticism |date=November 30, 2009|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-perils-of-skepticism_b_373788.html |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Phil Plait]] said this statement trembled "on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie", listing [[Carl Sagan]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[Edward Jenner]] among the "thousands of scientists [who] are skeptics", who he said were counterexamples to Chopra's statement.&lt;ref name=plait&gt;{{cite web |title=Deepak Chopra: redefining 'wrong' |authorlink=Phil Plait |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=December 1, 2009 |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/01/deepak-chopra-redefining-wrong/ |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misuse of scientific terminology ===
{{See also|Quantum mysticism}}

Reviewing [[Susan Jacoby]]'s book, ''The Age of American Unreason'', [[Wendy Kaminer]] sees Chopra's popular reception in the USA as being symptomatic of many Americans' historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) "to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science". Chopra's "nonsensical references to quantum physics" are placed in a lineage of American religious [[pseudoscience]], extending back through [[Scientology]] to [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=jaco&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Corrosion of the American Mind (reviewing ''The Age of American Unreason'' by [[Susan Jacoby]])| first=Wendy| last=Kaminer| authorlink=Wendy Kaminer| journal=The Wilson Quarterly| volume=32

Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of [[quantum mechanics]] to [[healing]] processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]], [[decoherence]] and the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name=csi&gt;{{cite journal| last=Stenger | first=Victor J|authorlink=Victor J.

Shermer and Harris criticized Chopra's use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts.&lt;ref name=Nightline&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/FaceOff/nightline-face-off-god-future/story?id=10170505 |title=Face-Off: Does God Have a Future|network=ABC|air-date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010|series=Nightline|season=30|number=58|transcript=Transcript from the Internet Archive|transcript-url=https://archive.org/details/WMAR_20100324_033500_Nightline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 paper examining "the reception and detection of pseudo-profound [[bullshit]]" used Chopra's Twitter feed as the canonical example, and compared this with fake Chopra quotes generated by a spoof website.&lt;ref name="Indie-Bullshit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-find-a-link-between-low-intelligence-and-acceptance-of-pseudo-profound-bulls-a6757731.html | title=Scientists find a link between low intelligence and acceptance of 'pseudo-profound bulls***' | work=The Independent | date=December 4, 2015 | accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo-Bullshit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pseudo-intellectual-profound-bullshit-study_5661acb4e4b079b2818e4020 | title=Study Finds People Who Fall For Nonsense Inspirational Quotes Are Less Intelligent | work=The Huffington Post | date=December 4, 2015 | accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pennycook2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pennycook | first = Gordon | display-authors = etal | title = On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound b......t | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–563 | publisher = Society for Judgment and Decision Making (SJDM) and the European Association for Decision Making (EADM) | location = Pennsylvania | date = November 2015 | url = http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html | accessdate = December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yoga ===
In April 2010 [[Aseem Shukla]], co-founder of the [[Hindu American Foundation]], criticized Chopra for suggesting that [[yoga]] did not have its origins in [[Hinduism]] but in an older Indian spiritual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/dr_chopra_honor_thy_heritage.html |title=April 28, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopra later said that yoga was rooted in "consciousness alone" expounded by Vedic [[rishi]]s long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He said that Shukla had a "fundamentalist agenda". Shukla responded by saying Chopra was an exponent of the art of "How to Deconstruct, Repackage and Sell Hindu Philosophy Without Calling it Hindu!", and he said Chopra's mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate.&lt;ref name="Honor thy heritage"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/dr_chopra_honor_thy_heritage.html |title=Dr. Chopra: Honor thy heritage |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/hinduism_and_sanatana_dharma_one_and_the_same.html |title=On Faith Panelists Blog: Hinduism and Sanatana Dharma: One and the same – Aseem Shukla |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal actions ==
In May 1991, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') published an article by Chopra and two others on Ayurvedic medicine and TM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1817464 |doi= 10.1001/jama.265.20.2633 |url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=385970 | title=Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern insights into ancient medicine |date=May 22, 1991 |author=Hari M.

'''Dental vibration appliances''', sold under the brand name '''AcceleDent''', '''OrthoAccel''', and '''Tooth Masseuse''', are devices that apply vibration called "micropulses" to [[dental braces]] and are claimed to thus speed [[tooth]] movement.&lt;ref name=El2015/&gt; Evidence as of 2015 was unclear if the appliances were able to accomplish this.&lt;ref name=El2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El-Angbawi|first1=A|last2=McIntyre|first2=GT|last3=Fleming|first3=PS|last4=Bearn|first4=DR|title=Non-surgical adjunctive interventions for accelerating tooth movement in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 November 2015|issue=11|pages=CD010887|pmid=26576758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been few studies looking into the devices' safety and effectiveness.&lt;ref name=El2015/&gt; It is therefore not possible to determine if they speed tooth movement.&lt;ref name=El2015/&gt;

The '''European Federation of Families of People with Mental Illness''' ('''EUFAMI''') is an international non-profit organisation registered in [[Belgium]] that primarily advocates on behalf of [[carers]]. It was founded in 1992 after a meeting where members from all over Europe "shared their experiences of helplessness and frustration when living with someone with severe [[mental illness]]". The organisation is active in lobbying [[European Union]] bodies on behalf of its member organisations. It has members in 26 European countries and one non-European country. It is a federation of 41 family associations (including two non-European ones) and 5 other mental health associations.

The vast majority of EUFAMI's funding comes from [[pharmaceutical companies]]{{fact|date=July 2010}}, including [[Astrazeneca]], [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen]], [[Eli Lilly and Company]], [[Pfizer Inc]], [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Lundbeck]]. It works in partnership with many of the same companies and with the [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31992">The '''Factory and Workshop Act 1895''' was a [[UK]] [[Act of Parliament]] intended to regulate the conditions, safety, health and wages of people working in factories. It gives an example of the serious problems in [[UK labour law]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Scope==

===Type of workplace===
The workplaces to which the act applies are, first, " factories " and " workshops "; secondly, laundries, docks, wharves, &amp;c., enumerated above as introduced and regulated partially only by the act of 1895 and subsequent acts. Apart from this secondary list, and having regard to workplaces which remain undefined by the law, the act may broadly be said to apply to premises, rooms or places in which manual labour, with or without the aid of mechanical power, is exercised for gain in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, washing, cleaning or finishing or adapting for sale of any article or part of any article. If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works (brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, etc., before workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories whether power is used in them or not. Factories are, again, subdivided into textile and non-textile: they are textile if the machinery is employed in preparing, manufacturing or finishing cotton, wool, hair, [[silk]], flax, [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[tow]], [[China-Grass Ramie (Rhea)|China grass]], [[coconut fibre]] or other like material either separately or mixed together, or mixed with any other material, or any fabric made thereof; all other factories are non-textile. The distinction turns on the historical origin of factory regulation and the regulations in textile factories remain in some respects slightly more stringent than in the non-textile factories and workshops, though the general provisions are almost the same. Three special classes of workshops have for certain purposes to be distinguished from ordinary workshops, which include [[tenement]] workshops:

:(a) Domestic workshops, ''i.e.'' any private house, room or place, which, though used as a dwelling, is by reason of the work carried on there a workshop, and in which the only persons employed are members of the same family, dwelling there alone—in these women's hours are unrestricted;
:(b) Women's workshops, in which neither children nor young persons are employed—in these a more elastic arrangement of hours is permissible than in ordinary workshops;
:(c) Workshops in which men only are employed—these come under the same general regulations in regard to sanitation as other workshops, also under the provisions of the Factory Act as regards security, and, if certified by the secretary of state, may be brought under special regulations. They are otherwise outside the scope of the act of 1901.

===People protected===
The person to whom the regulations apply in the above-defined workplaces are children, i.e. persons between the ages of twelve and fourteen, young persons, i.e. boys or girls between the ages of fourteen (or if an educational certificate has been obtained, thirteen) and eighteen years of age, and women, i.e. females above the age of eighteen; these are all "protected" persons to whom the general provisions of the act, inclusive of the regulation of hours and times of employment, apply. To adult men generally those provisions broadly only apply which are aimed at securing sanitation and safety in the conduct of the manufacturing process.

The person generally responsible for observance of the provisions of the law, whether these relate to health, safety, limitation of the hours of labour or other matters, is the ''occupier'' (a term undefined in the act) of the factory, workshop or [[laundry]]. There are, however, limits to his responsibility,

:(a) generally, where the occupier has used due [[diligence]] to enforce the execution of the act, and can show that another person, whether agent, servant, workman or other person, is the real offender;
:(b) specially in a factory the sections relating to employment of protected persons, where the owner or hirer of a machine or [[Tool|implement]] driven by mechanical power is some person other than the occupier of the factory, the owner or hirer, so far as respects any offence against the act committed in relation to a person who is employed in connexion with the machine or implement, and is in the employment or pay of the owner or hirer, shall be deemed to be the occupier of the factory;
:(c) for the one purpose of reporting accidents, the actual employer of the person injured in any factory or workshop is bound under penalty immediately to report the same to the occupier;
:(d) so far as relates to sanitary conditions, fencing of machinery, affixing of notices in ''tenement'' factories, the ''owner'' (as defined by the [[Public Health Act 1875]]), generally speaking, takes the place of the occupier.

Employment in a factory or workshop includes work whether for wages or not:
:(a) in a manufacturing process or handicraft,
:(b) in cleaning any place used for the same,
:(c) in cleaning or oiling any part of the machinery,
:(d) any work whatsoever incidental to the process or handicraft, or connected with the article made.

Persons found in any part of the factory or workshop, where machinery is used or manufacture carried on, except at [[meal]]-times, or when machinery is stopped, are deemed to be employed until the contrary is proved. The act, however, does not apply to employment for the sole purpose of repairing the premises or machinery, nor to the process of preserving and curing [[fish]] immediately upon its arrival in the fishing boats in order to prevent the fish from being destroyed or spoiled, nor to the process of cleaning and preparing [[fruit]] so far as is necessary to prevent it from spoiling during the months of June, July, August and September. Certain light handicrafts carried on by a family only in a private house or room at irregular intervals are also outside the scope of the act.

==Health and safety==
The foremost provisions are those relating to the sanitary condition of the workplaces and the general security of every class of worker. Every factory must be kept in a cleanly condition, free from noxious effluvia, ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, gases, vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the manufacture; must be provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences separate for the sexes; must not be overcrowded (not less than {{convert|250|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}. during the day, 400 during overtime, for each worker). In these matters the law of public health takes in workshops the place of the Factory Act, the requirements being substantially the same. Although, however, primarily the officers of the district council enforce the sanitary provisions in workshops, the government factory inspectors may give notice of any defect in them to the district council in whose district they are situate; and if proceedings are not taken within one month by the latter, the factory inspector may act in default and recover expenses from the district council. This power does not extend to domestic workshops which are under the law relating to public health so far as general sanitation is concerned. General powers are reserved to the secretary of state, where he is satisfied that the Factory Act or law relating to public health as regards workplaces has not been carried out by any district council, to authorize a factory inspector during a period named in his order to act instead of the district council. Other general sanitary provisions administered by the government inspectors are the requirement in factories and workshops of washing conveniences where poisonous substances are used; adequate measures for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature of such a kind as will not interfere with the purity of the air in each room in which any person is employed; maintenance of sufficient means of ventilation in every room in a factory or workshop (in conformity with such standard as may be prescribed by order of the secretary of state); provision of a fan to carry off injurious dust, gas or other impurity, and prevent their inhalation in any factory or workshop; drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. For laundries and bakehouses there are further sanitary regulations; ''e.g.'' in laundries all stoves for [[heating]] irons shall be sufficiently separated from any ironing-room or ironing-table, and the floors shall be " drained in such a manner as will allow the water to flow off freely "; and in bakehouses a cistern supplying water to a bakehouse must be quite separate from that supplying water to a water-closet, and the latter may not communicate directly with the bakehouse. Use of underground bakehouses (i.e. a [[baking]] room with floor more than {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. below the ground adjoining) is prohibited, except where already used at the passing of the act; further, in these cases, after 1 January 1904, a certificate as to suitability in light, ventilation, &amp;c., must be obtained from the district council. In other trades certified by the secretary of state further sanitary regulations may be made to increase security for health by special rules to be presently touched on. The secretary of state may also make sanitary requirements a condition of granting such exceptions to the general law as he is empowered to grant. In factories, as distinct from workshops, a periodical lime washing (or washing with hot water and [[soap]] where paint and [[varnish]] have been used) of all inside walls and ceilings once at least in every fourteen months is generally required (in bakehouses once in six months). As regards sufficiency and suitability of sanitary accommodation, the standards determined by order of the secretary of state shall be observed in the districts to which it is made applicable. An order was made called the Sanitary Accommodation Order, on 4 February 1903, the definitions and standards in which have also been widely adopted by local sanitary authorities in districts where the Order itself has no legal force, the local authority having parallel power under the [[Public Health Act of 1890]].

==Machinery==
Security in the use of machinery is provided for by precautions as regards the cleaning of machinery in motion and working between the fixed and traversing parts of self-acting machines driven by power, by fencing of machinery, and by empowering inspectors to obtain an order from a court of [[summary jurisdiction]] to prohibit the use, temporarily or absolutely, of machinery, ways, works or plant, including use of a steam boiler, which cannot be used without danger to life and limb. Every hoist and fly-[[wheel]] directly connected with mechanical power, and every part of a water-wheel or [[engine]] worked by mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power; young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use of dangerous premises is provided for by empowering courts of summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or, in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed; special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council, in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards in each room in which more than ten persons are employed,/and to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must have a proper safety valve, a steam [[Gauge (engineering)|gauge]], and a water gauge, and every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper condition. Examination by a competent person must take place at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding £Ioo in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied for the benefit of the injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines. When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or workshop, the [[coroner]] must advise the factory inspector for the district of the place and time of the [[inquest]]. The secretary of state may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or workshop and (a) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (''b) '' are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal, hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, [[electricity]], so disabling any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work, (''c'') are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may determine, (''d'') not falling under the previous heads and yet cause disablement for more than [[Seven Days Battles|seven days]]' ordinary work to any person working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (a) or (''b'') notice has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases of lead, [[phosphorus]], arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or [[anthrax]], contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they come. The list of classes of poisoning can be extended by the secretary of state's order.

Certificates of physical fitness for employment must be obtained by the occupier from the certifying surgeon for the district for all persons under sixteen years of age employed in a factory, and in any class of workshops to which the requirement has been extended by order of the secretary of state, and an inspector may suspend any such persons for re-examination in a factory, or for examination in a workshop, when " disease or bodily infirmity " unfits the person, in his opinion, for the work of the place. The certifying surgeon may examine the process as well as the person submitted, and may qualify the certificate he grants by conditions as to the work on which the person is fit to be employed. An occupier of a factory or workshop or laundry shall not knowingly allow a woman to be employed therein within four weeks after childbirth.

==Children and women==
The employment of children, young persons and women is regulated as regards ordinary and exceptional hours of work, ordinary and exceptional meal-times, length of spells and holidays. The outside limits of ordinary periods of employment and holidays are, broadly, the same for textile factories as for non-textile factories and workshops; the main difference lies in the requirement of not less than a total two hours' interval for meals out of the twelve, and a limit of four and a half hours for any spell of work, a longer weekly half [[holiday]], and a prohibition of overtime, in textile factories, as compared with a total one and a half hours' interval for meals and a limit of five hours for spells and (conditional) permission of overtime in non-textile factories. The hours of work must be specified, and from Monday to Friday may be between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., or 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.; in non-textile factories and workshops the hours also may be taken between 8 A.M. and 8 P.M. or by order of the secretary of state for special industries 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Between these outside limits, with the proviso that mealtimes must be fixed and limits as to spells observed, women and young persons may be employed the full-time, children on the contrary only half time, on alternate days, or in alternate sets attending school half time regularly. On Saturdays, in textile factories in which the period commences at 6 A.M. all manufacturing work must cease at 12 if not less than one hour is given for meals, or I I.30 if less than one hour is given for meals (half an hour extra allowed for cleaning), and in non-textile factories and workshops at 2 P.M., 3 P.M. or 4 P.M., according as the hour of beginning is 6 A.M., 7 A.M. or 8 A.M. In " domestic workshops " the total number of hours for young persons and children must not exceed those allowed in ordinary workshops, but the outside limits for beginning and ending are wider; and the case is similar as regards hours of women in " women's workshops." Employment outside a factory or workshop in the business of the same is limited in a manner similar to that laid down in the [[Shop Hours Act]], to be touched on presently. Overtime in certain classes of factories, workshops and warehouses attached to them is permitted, under conditions specified in the acts, for women, to meet seasonal or unforeseen pressure of business, or where goods of a perishable nature are dealt with, for young persons only in a very limited degree in factories liable to stoppage for drought or [[flood]], or for an unfinished process. These and other cases of exceptional working are under minute and careful administrative regulations. Broadly these same regulations as to exceptional overtime may apply in ''laundries'' but the act of 1907 granted to laundries not merely [[wikt:ancillary|ancillary]] to the manufacture carried on in a factory or workshop (e.g. [[shirt]] and [[collar (clothing)|collar]] factories), additional power to fix different periods of employment for different days of the week, and to make use of one or other of two exceptional methods of arranging the daily periods so as to permit of periods of different length on different days; these exceptional periods cannot be worked in addition to overtime permissible under the general law. Laundries carried on in connexion with charitable or reformatory institutions were brought in 1907 within the scope of the law, but special schemes for regulation as to hours, meals, holidays, &amp;c., may be submitted by the managers to the secretary of state, who is empowered to approve them if he is satisfied that they are not less favourable than the corresponding provisions of the principal act; such schemes shall be laid as soon as possible before both Houses of Parliament.

==Night work==
Night work is allowed in certain specified industries, under conditions, for male young persons, but for no other workers under eighteen, and overtime for women may never be later than 10 P.M. or before 6 A.M. Sunday work is prohibited except, under conditions, for [[Jew]]s; and in factories, workshops and laundries six holidays (generally the [[bank]] holidays) must be allowed in the year. In creameries in which women and young persons are employed the secretary of state may by special order vary the beginning and end of the daily period of employment, and allow employment for not more than three hours on Sundays and holidays.

==Statutory instruments==
The general provisions of the act may be supplemented where specially dangerous or unhealthy trades are carried on, by special regulations. This was provided for in the law in force until 31 December 1901, as in the existing principal act, and the power to establish rules had been exercised between 1892 and 1901 in twenty two trades or processes where injury arose either from handling of dangerous substances, such as lead and lead compounds, phosphorus, [[arsenic]] or various chemicals, or where there is inhalation of irritant dust or noxious fumes, or where there is danger of explosion or infection of anthrax. Before the rule could be drawn up under the acts of 1891 to 1895, the secretary of state had to certify that in the particular case or class of cases in question (e.g. process or machinery), there was, in his opinion, danger to life or limb or risk of injury to health; thereupon the chief inspector might propose to the occupier of the factory or workshop such special rules or measures as he thought necessary to meet the circumstances. The occupier might object or propose modifications, but if he did not the rules became binding in twenty-one days; if he objected, and the secretary of state did not assent to any proposed modification, the matters in difference had to be referred to [[arbitration]], the [[award]] in which finally settled the rules or requirement to be observed.

In November 1901, in the case of the earthenware and china industry, the last arbitration of the kind was opened and was finally concluded in 1903. The parties to the arbitration were the chief inspector, on behalf of the secretary of state, and the occupier or occupiers, but the workmen interested might be and were represented on the arbitration. In the establishing of the twenty-two sets of existing special rules only thrice has arbitration been resorted to, and only on two of these occasions were workmen represented. The provisions as to the arbitration were laid down in the first [[schedule (workplace)|schedule]] to the Act of 1891, and were similar to those under the Coal Mines Regulation Acts. Many of these codes have still the force of law and will continue until in due course revised under the amended procedure of the act of 1901. They might not only regulate conditions of employment, but also restrict or prohibit employment of any class of workers; where such restriction or prohibition affected adult workers the rules had to be laid for forty days before both Houses of Parliament before coming into operation. The obligation to observe the rules in detail lies on workers as well as on occupiers, and the section in the act of 1891 providing a penalty for non-observance was drafted, as in the case of the mines, so as to provide for a simultaneous fine for each (not exceeding two pounds for the worker, not exceeding ten pounds for the employer).

The provisions as to special regulations of the act of 1901 touch primarily the method of procedure for making the regulations, but they also covered for the first time domestic workshops and added a power as to the kind of regulations that may be made; further, they strengthened the sanction for observance of any rules that may be established, by placing the occupier in the same general position as regards penalty for non-observance as in other matters under the act. On the certificate of the secretary of state that any manufacture, machinery, plant, process or manual labour used in factories or workshops is dangerous or injurious to life, health or limb, such regulations as appear to the secretary of state to meet the necessity of the case may be made by him after he has duly published notice: (1) of his intention; (2) of the place where copies of the draft regulations can be obtained; and (3) of the time during which objections to them can be made by persons affected. The secretary of state may modify the regulations to meet the objections made. If not, unless the objection is withdrawn or appears to him frivolous, he shall, before making the regulations, appoint a competent person to hold a public inquiry with regard to the draft regulations and to report to him thereon. The inquiry is to be made under such rules as the secretary of state may lay down, and when the regulations are made, they must be laid as soon as possible before parliament. Either House may annul these regulations or any of them, without [[prejudice]] to the power of the secretary of state to make new regulations. The regulations may apply to all factories or workshops in which the certified manufacture, process, &amp;c., is used, or to a specified class. They may, among other things, (a) prohibit or limit employment of any person or class of persons; (''b'') prohibit, limit, or control use of any material or process; (c) modify or extend special regulations contained in the Act. Regulations have been established among others in the following trades and processes: felt [[hat]]-making where any inflammable solvent is used; [[file (tool)|file]]-cutting by hand; manufacture of electric accumulators; docks, processes of loading, unloading, &amp;c.; [[tar]] distilling; factories in which self-acting mules are used; use of locomotives; [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and weaving of flax, hemp and jute; manufacture of paints and colours; heading of [[yarn]] dyed by means of lead compounds.

==Wages and inspections==
Although the Factory and Workshop Acts have not directly regulated wages, they have made certain provision for securing to the worker that the amount agreed upon shall be received,

:(a) by extending every act in force relating to the inspection of [[weights and measures]] and [[weighing machines]] for use ''ticuJars'' in the [[sale of goods]] to those used in a factory or workshop for checking or ascertaining the wages of persons employed;
:(b) by ensuring that piece-workers in the textile trades (and other trades specified by the secretary of state) shall receive, before commencing any piece of work, clear particulars of the wages applicable to the work to be done and of the work to which that rate is to be applied.

Unless the particulars of work are ascertainable by an automatic indicator, they must be given to textile workers in writing, and in the case of weavers in the cotton, worsted and woollen trades the particulars of wages must be supplied separately to each worker, and also shown on a [[placard]] in a conspicuous position. In other textile processes, it is sufficient to furnish the particulars separately to each worker. The secretary of state has used his powers to extend this protection to non-textile workers, with suitable modifications, in various hardware industries, including pen-making, locks, chains, in wholesale tailoring and making of wearing apparel, in fustian cutting, [[umbrella]]-making, [[brush]]-making and a number of other piece-work trades. He further has in most of these and other trades used his power to extend this protection to [[outworker]]s.

With a view to efficient administration of the act,

:(a) certain notices have to be conspicuously exhibited at the factory or workshop,
:(b) registers and lists kept, and
:(c) notices sent ''Administo'' the inspector by the occupier.

Among the first the most important are the prescribed abstract of the act, the names and addresses of the inspector and certifying surgeon, the period of employment, and specified meal-times (which may not be changed without fresh notice to the inspector), the air space and number of persons who may legally be employed in each room, and prescribed particulars of exceptional employment; among the second are the general registers of children and young persons employed, of accidents, of limewashing, of overtime, and lists of outworkers; among the third are the notice of beginning to occupy a factory or workshop, which the occupier must send within one month, report of overtime employment, notice of accident, poisoning or anthrax, and returns of persons employed, with such other particulars as may be prescribed. These must be sent to the chief inspector at intervals of not less than one and not more than three years, as may be directed by the secretary of state.

The [[Secretary of State for the Home Department]] controls the administration of the acts, appoints the inspectors referred to in the acts, assigns to them their duties, and regulates the manner and cases in which they are to exercise the powers of inspectors. The act, however, expressly assigns certain duties and powers to a chief inspector and certain to district inspectors. Many provisions of the acts depend as to their operation on the making of orders by the secretary of state. These orders may impose special obligations on occupiers and increase the stringency of regulations, may apply exceptions as to employment, and may modify or relax regulations to meet special classes of circumstances. In certain cases, already indicated, his orders guide or determine the action of district councils, and, generally, in case of default by a council he may empower his inspectors to act as regards workplaces, instead of the council, both under the Factory Acts and Public Health Acts.

The powers of an inspector are to enter, inspect and examine, by day or by night, at any reasonable time, any factory or workshop (or laundry, dock, &amp;c.), or part of one, when he has reason to believe that any person is employed there; to take with him a [[constable]] if he has reasonable cause to expect obstruction; to require production of registers, certificates, &amp;c., under the acts; to examine, alone or in the presence of any other person, as he sees fit, every person in the factory or workshop, or in a school where the children employed are being educated; to prosecute, conduct or defend before a court of summary jurisdiction any proceeding under the acts; and to exercise such other powers as are necessary for carrying the act into effect. The inspector has also the duty of enforcing the Truck Acts in places, and in respect of persons, under the Factory Acts. Certifying surgeons are appointed by the chief inspector subject to the regulations of the secretary of state, and their chief duties are
:(a) to examine workers under sixteen, and persons under special rules, as to physical fitness for the daily work during legal periods, with power to grant qualified certificates as to the work for which the young worker is fit, and
:(b) to investigate and report on accidents and cases of lead, phosphorus or other poisoning and anthrax.

In 1907 there were registered as under inspection 110,276 factories, including laundries with power, 146,917 workshops (other than men's workshops), including laundries without power; of works under special rules or regulations (included in the figures just given) there were 10,586 and 19,687 non-textile works under orders for supply of particulars to pieceworkers. Of notices of accidents received there were 124,325, of which 1179 were fatal; of reported cases of poisoning there were 653, of which 40 were fatal. Prosecutions were taken by inspectors in 4474 cases and convictions obtained in 4211 cases. Of persons employed there were, according to returns of occupiers, 1904, 4,165,791 in factories and 688,756 in workshops.

'''Forensic psychiatry''' is a sub-speciality of [[psychiatry]] and is related to [[criminology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howells K, Day A, Thomas-Peter B | title=Changing Violent Behaviour: Forensic Mental Health and Criminological Models Compared | journal=Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology | volume=15 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=391–406 | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14788940410001655907 | doi=10.1080/14788940410001655907}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses the interface between [[law]] and psychiatry. A forensic psychiatrist provides services – such as determination of competency to stand trial – to a court of law to facilitate the adjudicative process and provide treatment like medications and psychotherapy to criminals.

==Court work==

Forensic psychiatrists work with [[court]]s in evaluating an individual's competency to stand [[trial]], defenses based on [[mental disorder]]s (e.g., the insanity defense), and [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] recommendations. There are two major areas of criminal evaluations in forensic psychiatry. These are Competency to Stand trial (CST) and Mental State at the Time of the Offense (MSO).

===Competency to stand trial (CST)===

This is the [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]] to determine that a defendant has the [[Intelligence|mental capacity]] to understand the charges and assist their attorney. In the United States, this is seated in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which ensures the right to be present at one's trial, to face one's accusers, and to have help from an attorney.

In English and Welsh law, a similar concept is that of "[[fitness to plead]]".

===As an expert witness===

Forensic psychiatrists are often called to be [[expert witness]]es in both [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] proceedings. [[Expert witness]]es give their opinion about a specific issue. Often the [[psychiatrist]] will have prepared a detailed report before testifying. The primary duty of the expert witness is to provide an independent opinion to the court. An expert is allowed to testify in court with respect to matters of opinion only when the matters in question are not ordinarily understandable to the finders of fact be they judge or jury. As such, prominent leaders in the field of forensic psychiatry, from Thomas Gutheil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutheil|first=Thomas G.|title=The Psychiatrist as Expert Witness|year=2009|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|isbn=1585623423|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Robert Simon and Liza Gold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Psychiatric Textbook of Forensic Psychiatry|year=2010|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|editor=Simon, Robert and Liza Gold|isbn=1585622648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadoff|first=Robert|title=Ethical Issues in Forensic Psychiatry. Minimizing Harm|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc|isbn=0470670134|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified teaching as a critical dimension in the role of expert witness. The expert will be asked to form an opinion and to testify about that opinion, but in so doing will explain the basis for that opinion which will include important concepts, approaches, and methods used in psychiatry.

===Mental state opinion===

This gives the court an opinion, and only an opinion, as to whether a defendant was able to understand what he/she was doing at the time of the crime. This is worded differently in many states, and has been rejected altogether in some, but in every setting, the intent to do a criminal act and the understanding of the criminal nature of the act bear on the final disposition of the case. Much of forensic psychiatry is guided by significant court rulings or laws that bear on this area which include the following three standards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bursztajn HJ, Scherr AE, Brodsky A | year = 1994 | title = The rebirth of forensic psychiatry in light of recent historical trends in criminal responsibility | url = http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artRebirthForensicPsychiatry.php | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 611–635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[M'Naghten rules]]: Excuses a defendant who, by virtue of a defect of reason or disease of the mind, does not know the nature and quality of the act, or, if they do, do not know that the act is indeed wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[M'Naghten's Case]], 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Durham rule]]: Excuses a defendant whose conduct is the product of mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Durham v. United States, 214 f.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954), overruled in U.S. v. Brawner, 471 f.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ALI test]]: Excuses a defendant who, because of a mental disease or defect, lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.&lt;ref&gt;Model Penal Code, Sec. 4.01 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Insanity defense|Not guilty by reason of insanity]]" (NGRI) is one potential outcome in this type of trial. It is important to note that [[insanity]] is a legal and not a medical term. Often there will be a psychiatrist(s) testifying for both the defense and the prosecution.

Forensic psychiatrists are also involved in the care of [[prison]]ers, both those in [[prison|jail]]s and those in prisons, and in the care of the mentally ill who have committed criminal acts (such as those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity).

==Risk management==
Many past offenders against other people, and suspected or potential future offenders with mental health problems or an intellectual or developmental disability, are supervised in the community by forensic psychiatric teams made up of a variety of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and care workers. These teams have dual responsibilities: to promote both the welfare of their clients and the safety of the public. The aim is not so much to predict as to prevent violence, by means of risk management.

Risk assessment and management is a growth area in the forensic field, with much Canadian academic work being done in Ontario and British Columbia. This began with the attempt to predict the likelihood of a particular kind of offence being repeated, by combining "static" indicators from personal history and offence details in actuarial instruments such as the [[RRASOR]] and [[Static-99]], which were shown to be more accurate than unaided professional judgment. More recently, use is being made also of "dynamic" risk factors, such as attitudes, impulsivity, mental state, family, and social circumstances, substance use, and the availability and acceptance of support, to make a "structured professional judgment." The aim of this is to move away from prediction to prevention, by identifying and then managing risk factors. This may entail monitoring, treatment, rehabilitation, supervision, and victim safety planning and depends on the availability of funding and legal powers. These schemes may be based on published assessments such as the [[HCR-20]] (which incorporates 10 Historical, 5 Clinical and 5 Risk Management factors) and the RSVP ([[Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol]]) from [[Simon Fraser University]], BC.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, most forensic psychiatrists work for the [[National Health Service]], in specialist secure units caring for mentally ill offenders (as well as people whose behaviour has made them impossible to manage in other hospitals). These can be either medium secure units (of which there are many throughout the country) or high secure hospitals (also known as Special Hospitals), of which there are three in England and one in Scotland (The State Hospital, Carstairs), the best known of which being [[Broadmoor Hospital]]. The other 'specials' are Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Liverpool and Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire. There are also a number of private sector medium secure units, which sell their beds exclusively to the NHS, as there are not enough secure beds available in the NHS system.

Forensic psychiatrists often also do prison inreach work, in which they go into prisons and assess and treat people suspected of having mental disorders; much of the day-to-day work of these psychiatrists comprises care of very seriously mentally ill patients {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, especially those suffering from [[schizophrenia]]. Some units also treat people with severe [[personality disorder]] or [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]]. The areas of assessment for courts are also somewhat different in Britain, because of differing mental health law. Fitness to plead and mental state at the time of the offence are indeed issues given consideration, but the mental state at the time of trial is also a major issue, and it is this assessment which most commonly leads to the use of mental health legislation to detain people in hospital, as opposed to their getting a prison sentence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Learning disabled offenders who are a continuing risk to others may be detained in learning disability hospitals (or specialised community-based units with a similar regime, as the hospitals have mostly been closed) as suffering from "mental impairment" in England and Wales, and without use of that term in Scotland. This includes those who commit serious crimes of violence, including sexual violence, and fire-setting. They would be cared for by learning disability psychiatrists and registered learning disability nurses (RNLD). Some psychiatrists doing this work have dual training in learning disability and forensic psychiatry or learning disability and adolescent psychiatry. Some nurses would have training in mental health also (RMN and  RNLD).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Court work (medico-legal work) is generally undertaken as private work by psychiatrists (most often forensic psychiatrists) as well as forensic and clinical psychologists, who usually also work within the National Health Service (NHS). This work is generally funded by the Legal Services Commission (used to be called Legal Aid).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Canada==

===Criminal law framework===
In Canada, certain credentialed medical practitioners may, at their discretion, make [[State (polity)|state]]-sanctioned investigations into and diagnosis of mental illness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Appropriate use of the [[DSM-IV-TR]] is discussed in its section entitled "Use of the DSM-IV-TR in Forensic Settings".

Concerns have been expressed {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} that the Canadian criminal justice system [[discrimination|discriminates]] based on DSM IV diagnosis within the context of Part XX of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-376.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, Part XX.1.]&lt;/ref&gt; This part sets out provisions for, among other things, court ordered attempts at "treatment" before individuals receive a trial as described in section 672.58 of the Criminal Code. Also provided for are court ordered "psychiatric assessments".  Critics have also expressed concerns {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} that use of the DSM-IV-TR may conflict with section 2(b) of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees the fundamental freedom of "thought, belief, opinion and expression"''.

===Confidentiality===
The position of the Canadian Psychiatric Association holds that "in recent years, serious incursions have been made by governments, powerful commercial interests, law enforcement agencies, and the courts on the rights of persons to their privacy." It goes on to state that "breaches or potential breaches of confidentiality in the context of therapy seriously jeopardize the quality of the information communicated between patient and psychiatrist and also compromise the mutual trust and confidence necessary for effective therapy to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Psychiatric Association, ''The Confidentiality of Psychiatric Records and the Patient's Right to Privacy(2000-21S)''&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of the forensic psychiatric process as it occurs in the province of Ontario is presented in the publication ''The Forensic Mental Health System In Ontario: An Information Guide''&lt;ref&gt;[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]], [http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/health_information/the_forensic_mental_health_system_in_ontario/Pages/the_forensic_mental_health_system_in_ontario.aspx ''The Forensic Mental Health System in Ontario: An Information Guide."]&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] in Toronto. The Guide states:  "Whatever you tell a forensic psychiatrist and the other professionals assessing you is not confidential."  The Guide further states:  "The forensic psychiatrist will report to the court using any available information, such as: police and hospital records, information given by your friends, family or co-workers, observations of you in the hospital." Also according to the Guide:  "You have the right to refuse to take part in some or all of the assessment. Sometimes your friends or family members will be asked for information about you. They have the right to refuse to answer questions too."&lt;ref&gt;[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]], [http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/health_information/the_forensic_mental_health_system_in_ontario/Pages/forensic_mhontario_whathappens.aspx "What Happens Inside the Forensic Mental Health System?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noteworthy that the emphasis in the Guide is on the right to refuse participation. This may seem unusual given that a result of a verdict of "Not Criminally Responsible by reason of Mental Disorder" is often portrayed as desirable to the defence, similar to the [[Insanity defense|insanity defence]] in the United States. A verdict of "Not Criminally Responsible" is referred to as a "defence" by the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#docCont Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 16, "defence of mental disorder".]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the issue of the accused's mental state can also be raised by the Crown or by the court itself, rather than solely by the defence counsel, differentiating it from many other [[Defense (legal)|legal defences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-377.html#docCont Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 672.11, 672.12.]&lt;/ref&gt;



===Treatment/assessment conflict===
In Ontario, a court ordered inpatient forensic assessment for criminal responsibility will typically involve both treatment and assessment being performed with the accused in the custody of a single multi-disciplinary team over a thirty- or sixty-day period. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Concerns have been expressed that an accused may feel compelled on ethical, medical or legal grounds to divulge information, medical, or otherwise, to assessors in an attempt to allow for and ensure safe and appropriate treatment during that period of custody .{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

There are Internet references addressing treatment/assessment conflict as it relates to various justice systems, particularly civil litigation in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10508420802623690 | volume=19 | title=Ethical Considerations of Multiple Roles in Forensic Services | year=2009 | journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior | pages=79–87 | author=Henley Woody Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Sara|last2=Friedman|first2=Susan H.|title=To Be or Not to Be: Treating Psychiatrist and Expert Witness|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/be-or-not-be-treating-psychiatrist-and-expert-witness|accessdate=12 December 2017|agency=Psychiatry Times|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Academy Of Psychiatry and the Law states in its ethics guidelines that "when a treatment relationship exists, such as in correctional settings, the usual physician-patient duties apply", which may be seen as contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapl.org/ethics.htm American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, "Ethics Guidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry".  Adopted May, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
In South Africa patients are referred for observation for a period thirty days by the courts if there is question of Competency to Stand trial (CST) and Mental State at the Time of the Offense (MSO). Serious crimes require a panel which may include two or more psychiatrists. Should the courts find the defendant not criminally responsible the defendant may become a state patient and be admitted in a forensic psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Kaliski, S. Z. (2006). Psycholegal assessment in South Africa. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
They are referred to receive treatment for an indefinite period, however most were back in the communityafter three years.
&lt;ref&gt;Marais B, Subramaney U. Forensic state patients at Sterkfontein Hospital: A 3-year follow-up study. S. Afr. j. psyc.  [Internet]. 2015  Aug [cited  2018  Mar  03] ;  21( 3 ): 86-92. Available from: http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2078-67862015000300003&amp;lng=en.  https://dx.doi.org/10.7196/SAJP.8255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training standards==
Some practitioners of forensic psychiatry have taken extra training in that specific area. In the [[United States]], one year [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]]s are offered in this field to psychiatrists who have completed their general psychiatry training. Such psychiatrists may then be eligible to sit for a board certification examination in forensic psychiatry. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], one is required to complete a three-year sub-speciality training in forensic psychiatry, after completing one's general psychiatry training, before receiving a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] as a forensic psychiatrist. In some countries, general psychiatrists can practice forensic psychiatry as well. However, other countries, such as Japan, require a specific certification from the government to do this type of work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8605">'''Herbert William Heinrich''' (October 6, 1886 &amp;ndash; June 22, 1962) was an [[United States|American]] industrial safety pioneer from the 1930s.

==Biography==
He was born on October 6, 1886 in [[Bennington, Vermont]].

He was an Assistant Superintendent of the Engineering and Inspection Division of [[Travelers Insurance Company]] when he published his book ''Industrial Accident Prevention, A Scientific Approach'' in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;United Steelworkers of America, "[http://www.aflcio.org/issues/safety/issues/upload/BBS501.pdf The Steelworker Perspective on Behavioral Safety]" (Pittsburg, PA, nd, p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayhurst&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hayhurst, ER |title=Review of Industrial Accident Prevention:  a Scientific Approach |journal=Am J Public Health Nations Health |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=119–20 |date=January 1932 |pmc=1556694 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.22.1.119-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One empirical finding from his 1931 book became known as Heinrich's Law: that in a workplace, for every accident that causes a major injury, there are 29 accidents that cause minor injuries and 300 accidents that cause no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heinrich HW |title=Industrial accident prevention: a scientific approach |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1931 |oclc=571338960}} &lt;br/&gt;quoted in {{cite book |author=Hollnagel, Erik |title=Safer Complex Industrial Environments: A Human Factors Approach | publisher=CRC Press|year=2009 |isbn=1-4200-9248-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich died on June 22, 1962, at the age of 76.

==Heinrich's Law==
{{main|Accident triangle}}
Heinrich's work is claimed as the basis for the theory of [[behavior-based safety]] by some experts of this field, which holds that as many as 95 percent of all workplace accidents are caused by unsafe acts.  Heinrich came to this conclusion after reviewing thousands of accident reports completed by supervisors, who generally blamed workers for causing accidents without conducting detailed investigations into the root causes.&lt;ref name="examining"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/6368-examining-the-foundation|title=Examining the foundation|publisher=Safety+Health Magazine|first=Ashley|last=Johnson|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Heinrich's figure that 88 percent of all workplace accidents and injuries/illnesses are caused by "man-failure" is perhaps his most oft-cited conclusion, his book actually encouraged employers to control hazards, not merely focus on worker behaviors.  "No matter how strongly the statistical records emphasize personal faults or how imperatively the need for educational activity is shown, no safety procedure is complete or satisfactory that does not provide for the . . . correction or elimination of . . . physical hazards," Heinrich wrote in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heinrich HW |title=Industrial accident prevention: a scientific approach |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1959 |edition=4th }} &lt;br/&gt;quoted in {{cite book |author1=Grimaldi, John V. |author2=Simonds, Rollin H. |title=Safety management |publisher=R. D. Irwin |location=Homewood, Ill |year=1973 |isbn=0-256-01564-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emphasizing this aspect of workplace safety, Heinrich devoted 100 pages of his work to the subject of machine guarding.&lt;ref name=Hayhurst/&gt; His research is criticized by some, such as Bruce Main and William Edwards Deming, for being outdated and unscientific. Main thinks that Heinrich's Law should be replaced by a model that emphasizes safety in design, compared to the former's emphasis on behavior.&lt;ref name="examining"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Heinrich's classic work has been revised into the more recent book,&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |author1=Roos, Nestor R. |author2=Heinrich, H. |author3=Brown, Julienne |author4=Petersen, Dan |author5=Hazlett, Susan |title=Industrial accident prevention: a safety management approach |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-07-028061-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}

Two later books challenge the findings and conclusions of Heinrich {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.
&lt;!--
"'''Heinrich Revisited: Truisms or Myths'''" by Fred A. Manuele, CSP, PE [2002, {{ISBN|0-87912-245-5}} published by [[National Safety Council]] offers the following in the last chapter.
"The intent of this book is to present a review of the origin of certain of Heinrich's premises that became accepted as truisms, how they evolved and changed over time, and to determine their validity.  A summary of the observations made in this book follows.

1. Files pertaining to Heinrich's research do not exist.  Thus, there is no material to review as the quality of research, or the analytical system used to arrive at his premises or their validity.

2. Heinrich's studies were made of accidents that occurred in the 1920s.  Safety at work and the workplace itself have changed substantively since then, as evidenced by noteworthy reductions in accident experience in the past 70 years.  Therefore, the current value and applicability of his conclusions should be questioned and researched.

3. Although psychology has a place in safety management, the emphasis Heinrich gave to it as being "a fundamental of great importance in accident causation" was disproportionate, and that overemphasis influenced his work considerably.

4. Heinrich's 88-10-2 ratios indicate that among the direct and proximate causes, 88 percent are unsafe acts, 10 percent are unsafe mechanical or physical conditions and 2 percent are unpreventable
* The methodology used in arriving at those ratios cannot be supported.
* Current causation knowledge indicates the premise to be invalid.
* This premise conflicts with the work of others, such as [[W. Edwards Deming]], whose research finds root causes to derive from shortcomings in the management systems.
* Among all the Heinrich premises, application of these ratios has had the greatest impact on the practice of safety, and has done the most harm, since it promotes preventive efforts being focused on the worker, rather than on the operating system.

5. The Foundation Of A Major Injury, the 300-29-1 ratios (Heinrich's triangle) is the least tenable of his premises.
* It is impossible to conceive of incident data being gathered through the usual reporting methods in 1926 in which 10 out of 11 accidents could be no-injury cases.
* Conclusions pertaining to the 300-29-1 ratios were revised from edition to edition, without explanation, thus presenting questions about which version is valid.

6. Heinrich's often-stated belief that the predominant causes of no-injury accidents are identical with the predominant causes of accidents resulting in major injuries is not supported by convincing evidence and is questioned by several authors.  Application of the premise results in misdirection since those who apply it may presume, inappropriately, that if they concentrate their efforts on the types of accidents that occur frequently, the potential for severe injury will be addressed.
* Investigation of numerous accidents resulting in fatality or serious injury by modern-day safety professionals leads to the conclusion that their causal factors are not linked to accidents that occur frequently and result in minor injury

7. No documentation exists to support Heinrich's 4-1 ratio of indirect injury costs to direct costs. Further, arriving at a ratio that is universally applicable is implausible.

8. In Principles of Accident Prevention, Heinrich place an inordinate emphasis on the unsafe acts of individuals as causal factors and gives insufficient attention to causal factors deriving from operating systems.  It is this author's belief that many safety practitioners would not agree with Heinrich's premise that "man failure is the heart of the problem and the methods of control must be directed toward man failure."

9. In Heinrich's Accident Factors, prominence is given to causal factors deriving from ancestry and environment and to the faults of persons that allegedly derive from inherited or acquired faults, that is, inappropriate with respect to current societal mores....."

The later book, "'''On the Practice of Safety''', Third Edition," by Fred Manuele [2003, {{ISBN|0-471-27275-2}} published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc] further discusses Heinrich and compares and contrasts his finding with those of W. Edwards Deming.--&gt;

==Early history== 
{{See also|History of the hamburger}}
[[File:DowneyMcdonalds.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Oldest McDonald's restaurant|oldest operating McDonald's]] on Lakewood and [[Florence Avenue|Florence]] in Downey, California, was the chain's third restaurant and the second to be built with the Golden Arches.]]
The McDonald family moved from [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] to [[Hollywood]], California in the late 1930s, where brothers [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]] ("Dick" and "Mac") began working as set movers and handymen at Motion-Picture studios.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Alan|title=The Origins of McDonald's Golden Arches|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|date=March 1986|volume=45|issue=1|pages=60–67|jstor=990129|doi=10.2307/990129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, their father Patrick McDonald opened "The Airdrome", a food stand, on Huntington Drive ([[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]) near the Monrovia Airport in the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] city of [[Monrovia, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skrabec|first=Quentin R.|title=The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBYJbFS52f0C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=1937,+Patrick+McDonald+opened+%22Mcdonald%27s%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MMwQik0zVX&amp;sig=afF4RBXmtiLp3X-F3J3C1JWkxss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgyNUfKNLeL1igLx7oCYDw&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=1937%2C%20Patrick%20McDonald%20opened%20%22Mcdonald%27s%22&amp;f=false|last2=Skrabec Jr.|first2=Quentin R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[hot dog]]s being one of the first items sold. Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard moved the entire building {{convert|40|mi|km}} east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in [[San Bernardino, California]]. The restaurant was renamed "McDonald's Bar-B-Que" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue.

In October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful [[carhop]] drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie.&lt;ref name=Bryson&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Made in America|date=1994|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self-service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply "McDonald's," and reopened on December 12, 1948.

In April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing [[Stanley Clark Meston]], an architect practicing in nearby Fontana.&lt;ref name="Hess"/&gt; The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish).&lt;ref name=HessBlog&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess|first=Alan|title=The oldest McDonald's as Architecture|url=http://alanhess.blogspot.sg/2013/08/the-oldest-mcdonalds-as-architecture.html|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called [[Golden Arches|"golden arches"]] even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process.&lt;ref name="Hess"/&gt; Other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments, in the 1950s, including [[Burger King]] and [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees.&lt;ref name="Hess"/&gt; Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at Central Avenue and Indian School Road in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].  Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette "Bud" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on August 18, 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in [[Downey, California]]. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the [[Oldest McDonald's restaurant|oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://doney.net/aroundaz/celebrity/mcdonald_bros.htm | title=McDonald Brothers | accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon.

[[File:Ray kroc 1976.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ray Kroc]] joined the chain in 1954 and built it into an eventually global franchise, making it the most successful fast food corporation in the world]]
In 1954, [[Ray Kroc]], a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe.

Believing the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture.&lt;ref name="Hess"/&gt; Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales.&lt;ref name="Hess"/&gt; Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], near [[Chicago]]. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. The restaurant was demolished in 1984. Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site now called [[McDonald's No. 1 Store Museum|McDonald's #1 Store Museum]].

{{Anchor|Frejlachs}}
Once the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for [[Cook County, Illinois]] to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonalds had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000 (${{Inflation|US|25000|1956|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.

== 1960s and 1970s ==
[[File:Big Mac hamburger.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Big Mac]] hamburger made its debut in 1968]]
In 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign "Look for the [[Golden Arches]]" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced [[Ronald McDonald]], a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children.

In the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the [[interstate highway system]] contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.

On May 3, 1960, Kroc assisted Christopher Boulos in opening a McDonald's franchise in [[DeKalb, Illinois]]. By 1965, the McDonald's at 805 W. Lincoln Highway sold over 4 million burgers and {{convert|1,000,000|lb|kg}} of fries. Boulos was the first Greek-American McDonald's franchise operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2016/02/16/from-the-archives-dekalbs-first-mcdonalds/a192lnf/|title=From the archives: DeKalb's first McDonald's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].

McDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the [[Filet-O-Fish]] sandwich, billed as "the fish that catches people", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/07/world/north-sea-cod-crisis-brings-call-for-nations-to-act.html|title=North Sea Cod Crisis Brings Call for Nations to Act|last=Smith|first=Craig S.|date=November 7, 2002|work=|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a "hulaburger", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during [[Lent]]). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary [[Big Mac]] made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the "You Deserve a Break Today" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.

In 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and [[Fred L. Turner]] became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success.

By the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new "[[mansard roof]]" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the "mansard roof" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson.

McDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion.

The company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the [[Egg McMuffin]] in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975.

Kroc was a firm believer in giving "something back into the community where you do business". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first [[Ronald McDonald House]], in [[Philadelphia]], to provide a "home away from home" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.

There was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and [[Hugh Morris (businessman)|Hugh Morris]] approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into [[New Zealand]], they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying "There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life." Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975.  They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at [[Porirua]], near [[Wellington]], to much more success than the corporation predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Rosemary |last= Hepözden |editor-first= Brian |editor-last= O'Flaherty |others= in co-op with McDonald's Restaurants (NZ) Ltd |title= Golden Arches under Southern Skies: Celebrating 35 years of McDonald's in New Zealand |year=2011 |publisher= Renaissance Publishing |location= Auckland |isbn= 978-0-9864521-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, McDonald's opened its first [[drive-thru]] window in [[Sierra Vista, Arizona]], following [[Wendy's]] lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the [[Happy Meal]], a [[combination meal|combo meal]] for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the "burger wars". Burger King suggested to customers: "have it your way"; Wendy's offered itself as the "fresh alternative" and launched their "[[Where's the beef?]]" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however.

During the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the [[McChicken]] in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with [[Chicken McNuggets]] a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles.

The first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-23/local/me-127_1_fast-food|title=Here's Your Hamburger, What's Your Hurry? :  Fast food: A tiny prefabricated McDonald's going up at the 32nd Street Naval Station will be missing something: seats.|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 [[Michael R. Quinlan]] became president of McDonald's Corporation, and [[Fred L. Turner]] became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants.

By 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in [[British Columbia]], Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.

In the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its [[Hamburger University]] in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received "Bachelor of Hamburgerology" degrees from the {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in [[Tokyo]] in 1971, in [[Munich]] in 1975, and in [[London]] in 1982.

[[Braille]] menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.

Clamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in [[microwave oven]] usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.

== 1990s ==
The first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in [[Dongmen, Shenzhen]] in October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Symotiuk, Rose|url=http://www.thatsmags.com/shenzhen/post/9902/shenzhen-then-and-now-dongmen|title=Shenzhen then and now: Dongmen|publisher=''[[That's Magazines|That's Shenzhen]]''|date=2015-05-21|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of [[recycling|recycled products]] annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. [[Environmental Defense Fund]] to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.

It took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day.

Much of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the [[Middle East]] opened in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first [[kosher]] McDonald's opened in a [[Jerusalem]] suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used "[[Halal]]" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered [[India]] for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, [[Sweden]].

Overall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.

In the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.

The company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The [[McLean Deluxe]] sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the [[Arch Deluxe]], itself an underperforming product. The "grown-up" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, [[Leo Burnett]], a 15-year McDonald's partner, after the nostalgic "My McDonald's" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, [[fajita]]s, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the [[Big King]] sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King.

In response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in [[Wal-Mart]]s and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. ([[Jack M. Greenberg]], who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.

On the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a [[Teenie Beanie]] Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[The Incredibles]]''. Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named [[DDB Needham]] as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful "You Deserve a Break Today" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed "Did Somebody Say McDonald's?" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.

=== Late 1990s ===
Following the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]] chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. [[McFlurry]] desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] system, dubbed "Made for You", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers "fresher, hotter food"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.

In May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from [[Pizza Hut]], replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.

McDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought [[Aroma Café]], a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added [[Donatos Pizza]], a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Donatos had  revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and [[Jim Cantalupo]] was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt [[Boston Market]] chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in [[Pret A Manger]], an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Café and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.

== 2000s ==
As it was exploring new avenues of growth, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 2000, a McDonald's in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] in [[Greater Detroit]] was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the [[Mississippi River]] to offer [[halal]] food for [[Muslim]] customers.&lt;ref&gt;"Restaurant caters to Muslim customers."

There were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in [[beef tallow]] until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any "confusion" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to [[Hindu]], [[vegetarian]], and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.

McDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or [[anti-globalization]] sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer [[José Bové]] destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in [[Millau]], France. In 2002 Bové, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with [[Starbucks]] Corporation and [[Nike, Inc.]]) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a [[World Trade Organization]] meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including [[Bolivia]] and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.

Early in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.

Cantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for [[AARP]] membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, [[McGriddles]] breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the "Rolling Energy" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, "I'm lovin' it". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of [[QSC&amp;V|QSC and V]]: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's "experience" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the "Forever Young" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity.

In December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.

McDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and [[share repurchase]]s. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out [[Super Size]] french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.

In the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, "no loitering" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers.

With the new "Forever Young" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with "distinct personalities". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible, padded, fabric-covered booth-seating, all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money. In addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.

McDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with them—a new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines.

==2010s==
In May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right.

In July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest restaurant in the world would be built on the [[2012 London Olympics]] site. The restaurant contains over 1,500 seats and is half the length of an [[American football]] field. Over 470 staff were employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. This restaurant will overshadow the current largest McDonald's in the world in [[Moscow, Russia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/01/25/article/mcdonalds_unveils_chicken_mcbites |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905091852/http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/01/25/article/mcdonalds_unveils_chicken_mcbites |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=McDonald's Unveils Chicken McBites |date=2012-01-25 |work=Los Angeles Times |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits.&lt;ref name="KLFY"&gt;{{cite web|title=McDonald’s franchisees say all-day breakfast launch a disaster|url=http://klfy.com/2015/10/17/mcdonalds-franchisees-say-all-day-breakfast-launch-a-disaster/|website=KFLY|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, McDonald's began to offer its breakfast menu all day starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Little|first1=Katie|title=McDonald's all-day breakfast?

* 1937: Patrick McDonald opens a [[food]] and drinks stand called "The Airdrome" on historic Route 66 (now Huntington Drive) near the Monrovia Airport in [[Monrovia, California#History|Monrovia, California]].
* 1940: Brothers [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]] move The Airdrome building {{convert|40|mi|km}} east to [[San Bernardino, California]], where they open the first McDonald's restaurant, near [[U.S. Route 66]], at West 14th St and 1398 North E St., on May 15. Its menu consisted of 25 items, mostly [[barbecue]]. As was common at the time, they employed around 20 [[carhop]]s. It became a popular and highly profitable teen hangout.
* 1948: After noticing that almost all of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed the restaurant for several months to remodel it and implement their innovative "[[Speedee|Speedee Service System]]", a streamlined [[assembly line]] for hamburgers. The carhops are fired, and when the restaurant reopens it sells only hamburgers, [[milkshake]]s, and [[french fries]]. At 15 cents, the burgers are about half as expensive as at standard diners, and they are served immediately. The restaurant is extremely successful, and its fame spreads by [[word of mouth]].

*1961: The McDonald brothers agree to sell Kroc business rights to their operation for $2.7 million, a sum that Kroc borrows from a number of investors, including [[Princeton University]]; Kroc considers the sum extreme, and it strains his relationship with the brothers. In a handshake agreement, the brothers would also receive an overriding royalty of 1% on the gross sales. At the closing table the brothers told Kroc that they were giving the real estate and rights to the original unit to the founding employees. Kroc closed the transaction, then refused to acknowledge the royalty portion of the agreement because it wasn't in writing. The brothers keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald's franchise. It was renamed "The Big M", while Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald's just one block north; he attended the opening in person. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain's annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today. Had Kroc adhered to the handshake agreement, these royalties would now be over $200 million a year.

*1963: One of Kroc's marketing insights is his decision to advertise McDonald's hamburgers to families and children. [[Washington, D.C.]] franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation) sponsor a children's show on [[WRC-TV]] called ''[[Bozo the Clown]]'', a franchised character played by [[Willard Scott]] from 1959 until 1962. After the show was cancelled, Goldstein hires Scott to portray McDonald's new mascot, named [[Ronald McDonald]]. According to Scott, they wanted to pay him in stock, but Scott decided to take the money. Scott, looking nothing like the familiar appearance of any [[McDonaldland]] character as is known today, appeared in the first three television advertisements featuring the character. After changing the character's first name to "Ronald" and replacing Scott with a new actor, and giving him the more familiar red, white, and yellow clown features, the character eventually spreads to the rest of the country via an advertising campaign. Years later, an entire cast of "McDonaldland" characters is developed.

*2005: McDonald's experiments with [[call center]]s for drive-through orders. The center, located in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], takes orders from more than a dozen stores in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The experiment is in part motivated by labor costs, since the [[List of U.S. state minimum wages|minimum wage in North Dakota]] is over 40% lower than that in [[Oregon]] or [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].
*2005: Owing in part to competitive pressure, McDonald's Australia adopts "Made for you" cooking platform in which the food is prepared from pre-cooked meat after the customer orders (as opposed to the firm's normal procedure since 1948, in which the food is cooked then sold as needed). It should become standard practice in all Australian restaurants by 2007. Some restaurants in New Zealand also follow suit. The practice had earlier been tested, and abandoned, in the U.S.

[[File:NCI Visuals Food Hamburger.jpg|300px|thumb|Hamburger profile showing the typical ingredients: bread, vegetables, and ground meat.]]
[[File:Burger and fries (1).jpg|300px|thumb|Open hamburger with [[processed cheese|cheese]] and [[French fries|fries]] served in an American [[diner]].]]
The '''hamburger''' (also commonly called “burger”) most likely first appeared in the 19th or early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Giovanni"&gt;Prof. Giovanni Ballarini, "''The Origin of Hamburgers and Ketchup''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rlmcdonald" /&gt; The modern [[hamburger]] was a product of the culinary needs of a society rapidly changing due to industrialization, the emergence of the [[working class]] and [[middle class]] and the demand for mass-produced, affordable food that could be consumed outside of the home.

[[Hamburger#Claims_of_invention|Considerable evidence]] suggests the USA was the first country where two slices of bread and a [[ground beef]] steak were combined into a "hamburger sandwich" and sold. There is some controversy over the origin of the hamburger because its two basic ingredients, bread and beef, had been prepared and consumed separately for many years in different countries before their combination. Shortly after its creation, the hamburger quickly included all of its currently typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce, and sliced [[pickled cucumber|pickles]].

After various controversies in the 20th century, including a nutritional controversy in the late 1990s, the burger is now readily identified with the United States, and a particular style of cuisine, namely fast food.&lt;ref name="ilustra"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-DfAAAAMAAJ|title=Hamburger Heaven: The Illustrated History of the Hamburger|last=Tennyson|first=Jeffrey|date=|publisher=Hyperion|year=1993|isbn=9781562829827|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[fried chicken]] and [[apple pie]], the hamburger has become a culinary icon in the United States.&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Edge, John T. |title= Hamburgers and Fries: An American Story |edition= 1st |year= 2005 |publisher= Putnam Adult |location= New York |isbn= 0-399-15274-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amer"&gt;{{Cite book |author= C. Counihan |title= Food in the USA |edition= 1st |date=July 2002 |publisher= Routledge |location= New York |isbn= 0-415-93232-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hamburger's international popularity demonstrates the larger [[globalization]] of food&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt; that also includes the rise in global popularity of other national dishes, including the (Italian) [[pizza]], and Japanese [[sushi]]. The hamburger has spread from continent to continent perhaps because it matches familiar elements in different culinary cultures.&lt;ref name="McGlobal" /&gt; This global culinary culture has been produced, in part, by the concept of selling processed food, first launched in the 1920s by the [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] restaurant chain and its visionary Edgar Waldo "Billy" Ingram and then refined by [[McDonald's]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcs" /&gt; This global expansion provides economic points of comparison like the [[Big Mac Index]],&lt;ref name="BigIndex" /&gt; by which one can compare the purchasing power of different countries where the [[Big Mac]] hamburger is sold.

Prior to the disputed invention of the hamburger in the United States, similar foods already existed in the culinary tradition of Europe. The [[Apicius]] cookbook, a collection of ancient Roman recipes that may date to the early 4th century, details a preparation of beef called ''isicia omentata''; served as a baked patty in which beef is mixed with pine kernels, black and green peppercorns, and white wine, ''isicia omentata'' may be the earliest precursor to the hamburger.&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pantke|first1=Micaela|title=Antique Roman Dishes - Collection|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/ethnic/historical/ant-rom-coll.html#3|website=[[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science Recipe Archive]]|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, the [[nomadic]] [[Mongols]] carried food made of several varieties of milk (''[[kumis]]'') and meat ([[horse meat|horse]] or [[camel meat|camel]]).&lt;ref name="Mongol" /&gt; During the life of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] (1167–1227), the Mongol army occupied the western portions of the modern-day nations of Russia, [[Ukraine]], and [[Kazakhstan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Weatherford, Jack |title= Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World |edition= 1st |date=March 2005 |publisher= Three Rivers Press |isbn= 0-609-80964-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the so-called [[Golden Horde]]. This cavalry dominated army was fast moving and sometimes unable to stop for a meal, so they often ate while riding. They wrapped a few slices of meat under their [[saddle]]s so it would crumble under pressure and motion and be cooked by heat and friction. This recipe for [[Ground meat|minced meat]] spread throughout the [[Mongol Empire]] until its split in the 1240s.&lt;ref name="Mongols"&gt;Morgan, David. "''The Mongols''" (Blackwell Publishers; Reprint edition, April 1990), {{ISBN|0-631-17563-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for Mongol armies to follow different groups of animals (such as [[herd]]s of horses or oxen or flocks of sheep) that provided the necessary protein for the warriors' diets.&lt;ref name="Mongol" /&gt; [[Marco Polo]] also recorded descriptions of the culinary customs of the Mongol warriors, indicating that the flesh of a single [[pony]] could provide one day's sustenance for 100 warriors.

When Genghis Khan's grandson [[Kublai Khan]] (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, he and his warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This was later called ''[[steak tartare]]''.&lt;ref name="Mongol"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Turnbull, Stephen |title= Mongol Warrior 1200–1350 |edition= 1st |year= 2003 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |location= London |isbn= 1-84176-583-X |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city states of what is now Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald McDonald's The Complete Hamburger 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Prosper Montagné (1938), "''Larousse gastronomique''"&lt;/ref&gt; While not providing a clear name, the first description of steak tartare was given by [[Jules Verne]] in 1875 in his novel ''[[Michael Strogoff]]''. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes [[Labskaus]] and [[Mett]]. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian [[carpaccio]], which itself was invented in 1930 at [[Harry's Bar (Venice)|Harry's Bar]] in Venice.&lt;ref name="cipriani"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cipriani, Arrigo |title=Harry's Bar: The Life and Times of the Legendary Venice Landmark |year=1996 |publisher=Arcade |location=New York |isbn=1-55970-259-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled ''[[Art of Cookery|Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy]]'' by [[Hannah Glasse]] (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including [[nutmeg]], [[cloves]], [[black pepper]], garlic, and salt, and is typically served with [[toast]]. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as [[meatloaf]],&lt;ref name="Boston" /&gt; the [[Serbia]]n [[pljeskavica]], the Arab [[kofta]], and [[Swedish meatball|meatballs]].

While ground beef was used by various cultures in Europe and Central Asia, the hamburger's other vital ingredient, bread, has a [[history of bread|different history]]. Bread had always been part of the development of many types of foods, including [[sauce]]s, such as those described by [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] in his compendium entitled ''L'art de la cuisine française au XIXe siècle''. The word ''[[sandwich]]'' was not recorded until the 18th century. Many cultures claim invention of the sandwich, but it was given its name around the year 1765 in honor of the English aristocrat [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], who preferred to eat sandwiches so he could play cards without soiling his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Rodger, N.

===Hamburg and its port===
[[File:Hamburger Hafen 1890.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The port of [[Hamburg]] in the 1890s.]]
Minced meat was a delicacy in [[medieval cuisine]], [[red meat]] usually being restricted to the higher classes.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Beardsworth, Teresa Keil, (1997), "''Sociology on the Menu: An Invitation to the Study of Food and Society''", Ed. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Very little [[mincing]] was done by medieval butchers or recorded in the [[cookbook]]s of the time, perhaps because it was not part of the [[sausage]]-making process that preserve meat. Russian ships brought recipes for steak tartare to the [[port of Hamburg]] during the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Clapp, Edwin J. |title= The Port of Hamburg |edition= 1st |year= 1952 |publisher= Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a time when there was such a great presence of Russian residents there that it was nicknamed "the Russian port." Trade within the [[Hanseatic League]] between the 13th and 17th centuries made this port one of the largest in Europe, its commercial importance being further heightened as it became vital to early transatlantic voyages during the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|age of steam]]. In the period of [[European colonization of the Americas]], immigrants to this port were a "bridge" between old European recipes and the future development of the hamburger in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cummings" /&gt;

During the first half of the 19th century, most of the northern European emigrants who traveled to the [[New World]] embarked on their transatlantic voyages from Hamburg. The German shipping company [[Hamburg America Line]], also known as the ''Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft'' (HAPAG), was involved in [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] transport for almost a century.&lt;ref name="Moch" /&gt; The company began operations in 1847 and employed many German immigrants, many of them fleeing the [[revolutions of 1848 in Germany|revolutions of 1848–9]]. The vast majority of settlers and emigrants from various parts of northern Europe also began voyages to the United States from Hamburg, introducing the culinary customs to state they come into.&lt;ref name="Moch"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Moch, Leslie Page |title= Moving Europeans: Migration in Western Europe Since 1650 |edition= 2nd |year= 2003 |publisher= Indiana University Press |isbn= 0-253-21595-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City was the most common destination for ships traveling from [[Hamburg]], and various restaurants in the city began offering the Hamburg-style steak in order to attract German sailors. The steak frequently appeared on the menu as a ''Hamburg-style American fillet'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ranhofer, Charles |title= The Epicurean: A Complete Treatise of Analytical &amp; Practical Studies |edition= 1st |year= 1894 |id= B00085H6PE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozersky"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hamburger: A History (Icons of America)|first=Josh|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-300-11758-2|edition=1st|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Ozersky}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even ''beefsteak à Hambourgeoise''.  Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants, evoking memories of the port of Hamburg and the world they left behind.&lt;ref name="Moch" /&gt;

===Hamburg steak===
In the late 19th century, the [[Hamburg steak]] became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|port of New York]]. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted and often smoked, and usually served raw in a dish along with onions and [[bread crumbs]].&lt;ref&gt;1802, "''Oxford English Dictionary''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theodora"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Food of the Western World: An Encyclopedia of Food from North America and Europe|first=Theodora|date=January 1976|publisher=Random House Inc|year=|isbn=0-8129-0427-3|edition=1st|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Fitzgibbon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest document that refers to the Hamburg steak is a [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] menu from 1873 which offered customers an 11-cent plate of Hamburg steak that had been developed by American chef [[Charles Ranhofer]] (1836–1899). This price was high for the time, twice the price of a simple fillet of beef steak.&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Food in American History, Part 6&amp;nbsp;– Beef (Part 1): Reconstruction and Growth into the 20th Century (1865–1910), by Louis E. Grivetti, PhD, Jan L. Corlett, PhD, Bertram M. Gordon, PhD, and Cassius T. Lockett, PhD&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century the Hamburg steak was gaining popularity because of its ease of preparation decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day.&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Farmer, Fannie Merritt |title= Boston Cooking-School Cookbook |year= 1896 |publisher= Gramercy (ed. 1997) |isbn= 0-517-18678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents show that this preparation style was used by 1887 in some U.S. restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals; the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw [[egg (food)|egg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Murrey, Thomas Jefferson |title= Cookery for Invalids |url= https://www.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;dq=Hamburg+steak&amp;id=YjgFAAAAYAAJ#PPA1,M1 |format= PDF |accessdate= 2013-12-24 |edition= 1st |year= 1887 |publisher= White Stokes &amp; Allen |location= New York City |isbn= |pages= 30–33 |chapter= Eating Before Sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The menus of many American restaurants during the 19th century included a Hamburg beefsteak that was often sold for breakfast.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;Roger M. Grace, "''Old Menus Tell the History of Hamburgers''", Los Angeles, CA Metropolitan New-Enterprise newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of Hamburg steak is the ''[[Salisbury steak]]'', which is usually served with a [[gravy]] similar in texture to [[brown sauce]]. Invented by Dr. [[James Salisbury]] (1823–1905), the term ''Salisbury steak'' has been used in the United States since 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salisbury%20steak |title=Salisbury steak |accessdate=2009-01-28 |work=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, in the city of Hamburg as well as in parts of [[northern Germany]], this type dish is called [[Frikadelle]], Frikandelle, or Bulette, which is similar to the meatball. The term ''hamburger steak'' was replaced by ''hamburger'' by 1930, which has in turn been somewhat displaced by the simpler term, ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Merriam-Webster |title= The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories |volume= I |year= 1995 |publisher= Merriam-Webster |isbn= 0-87779-603-3 |pages= 210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term is now commonly used as a suffix to create new words for different variants of the hamburger, including [[cheeseburger]], [[porkburger]], [[bacon]]burger and [[moose]]burger. There are other foods with names derived from German cities that are shortened in different ways in [[American English]]. An example is the [[Hot dog|frankfurter]], often abbreviated as ''frank''.&lt;ref name="Merriam" /&gt;

Many recipes and dishes traveled along with transatlantic immigrants to their destinations in the New World. Some authors question whether the [[Hamburg America Line]] was part of this, arguing that the hamburger was created to meet needs that arose amongst immigrants already in the New World.&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCmeQIOykgkC|title=Fast Food, Fast Track: Immigrants, Big Business, and the American Dream|last=Talwar|first=Jennifer Parker|date=|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=0786751843|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, support the thesis that the Hamburg America Line brought the first Hamburger steaks from Europe to the Americas.&lt;ref name="Theodora" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Decsy"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Decsy, Ayula |title= Hamburger for America and the World: A Handbook of the Transworld Hamburger Culture |edition= 1st |volume= 3 |year= 1984 |publisher= Eurolingua |isbn= 0-931922-15-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hamburger as it is known today has multiple invention claims ranging between 1885 and 1904, but it is clearly the product of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Smith, Andrew F. |title= Hamburger: A Global History |edition= 1st |date=November 2008 |publisher= Reaktion Books |isbn= 1-86189-390-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following 100 years, the hamburger spread throughout the world as a result of the emerging concept of fast food and a new business model: the [[Chain store|franchise]].

The industrial use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first [[meat grinder]] was invented in the early 19th century by the German engineer [[Karl Drais]]. The machine made it possible for minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wade registered Patent Number x5348 on January 26, 1829 for an instrument entitled "Meat Cutter"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Coffman of Virginia received Patent Number 3935 on February 28, 1845 for an "Improvement in Machines for Cutting Sausage-Meat"&lt;/ref&gt; These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized [[chisel]]s, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced.&lt;ref name="SusanW"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Williams, Susan |title= Food in the United States, 1820s–1890 |edition= 1st |date=August 2006 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-313-33245-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots in the minds of many Americans.&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt; Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including [[hot dog]]s and [[meatloaf]].&lt;ref name="SusanW" /&gt;

Another development facilitating the invention and popularization of the proto-hamburger was the increased production of beef through livestock intensification. By the late 19th century, an increasing amount of land was being devoted to cattle and a growing number of people being employed as [[cowboy]]s, resulting in the United States becoming one of the world's largest producers and consumers of beef.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Osborn Cummings, Richard |title= The American and His Food (The Rise of urban America) |edition= 1st |date=June 1970 |publisher= Ayer Co Pub |isbn= 0-405-02445-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1880s were declared ''The Golden Age of Beef'', during which the abundance of rural beef production made vital its transportation by rail from agricultural to urban areas. This gave rise to various methods of meat preservation for making possible the consumption of fresh meat in urban and industrialized areas, among the [[refrigerator car]]s and different methods of packaging meat (such as [[corned beef]]), which were promoted by industrialists like [[Gustavus Swift]] (1839–1903). Around this time, the city of Chicago, along with other cities on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], became a focal point for the large-scale processing of beef. Beef was already inexpensive at that time, and it was available to the working class. This put the Hamburg steak within reach of the vast majority of the population, giving rise to what some authors jokingly call the "American beef dream".&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt; In this era, the number of [[steakhouse]]s that specialized in serving steaks increased markedly; some restaurants even served steak along with seafood, in a dish known as [[Surf and turf]].

The high production and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the [[meat industry]] increasingly powerful by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="SusanW" /&gt; [[Corporate corruption|Corruption]] problems soon arose in the meat industry, problems that endangered both quality and hygiene. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Upton Sinclair]] published ''[[The Jungle]]'', a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry, intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself. The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], which was sponsored by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. ''The Jungle'' was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger, as it led the American public to force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their cooked meat.&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt; In 1933, Arthur Kallett published a similar book, entitled ''100 million guinea pigs; Dangers in Everyday foods, drugs, and cosmetics'', which warned consumers specifically about the content [[preservative]]s in hamburgers.

===Controversial origins===
[[File:Big Mac hamburger - Japan (1).jpg|300px|thumb|The [[Big Mac]] popularized an evolution in the image of the hamburger.]]
The exact origin of the hamburger may never be known with any certainty. Most historians believe that it was invented by a cook who placed a Hamburg steak between two slices of bread in a small town in Texas, and others credit the founder of White Castle for developing the "Hamburger Sandwich." Records from that time are scarce, however.&lt;ref name="rlmcdonald"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Complete_Hamburger.html?id=cr1mQgAACAAJ|title=The Complete Hamburger: The History of America's Favorite Sandwich|last=McDonald|first=Ronald L.|date=1997|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781559724074|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All claims for invention occur between 1885 and 1904, making it probable that the hamburger was created sometime in these two decades. Despite varieties, there are common elements in all of the narratives, most notably that the hamburger was born as a food associated with major events such as [[amusement park]]s, [[fair]]s, [[Meeting|conferences]], and festivals. All the hypotheses also share the presence of [[street vendor]]s.

One of the first "birth of the burger" stories belongs to Canton, Ohio natives Frank and Charles Menches who were food vendors at the 1885 Erie County Fair outside of Buffalo, New York, also known as the Hamburg Fair. Legend has it that during the course of the Fair, the Menches ran out of their signature menu item of pork sausage sandwiches. Their local supplier, Hamburg butcher Andrew Klein, was reluctant to butcher more hogs during a period of unseasonable late summer heat and suggested to substitute the use of ground beef.  The brothers fired some up, but both found it dry and bland. They added coffee, brown sugar and other ingredients to create a unique taste. The original sandwiches were sold with just ketchup and sliced onions. With new found success with their beef sandwich, they christened it the “hamburger” after the Erie County Fair’s home town of Hamburg. "National Birth of the Burger Day" is celebrated on September 18th to honor the invention of the burger in 1885 at the Hamburg Fair. In the 1920s, carnival historian John C. Kunzog interviewed Frank Menches about his experience at the Erie County Fair. His detailed hamburger story was published in this book, “Tanbark &amp; Tinsel” published in 1970.

One of the possible fathers of the hamburger is [[Charlie Nagreen]] (1871–1951) of [[Seymour, Wisconsin]], who at the age of 15 sold Hamburg steaks from a street stall at the annual Outagamie County Fair. Nagreen said he began by selling Hamburg steaks, but these did not have much success because people wanted to freely move around the festival without the need to eat them at his stand. In response to this, in 1885 Nagreen decided to flatten the hamburger steak and insert it between two slices of bread, so that the public could move freely from booth to booth while eating his sandwich, an innovation that was well received by his customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.herald-journal.com/archives/1998/columns/mh101298.html|title=The real home of the hamburger|last=Heuer|first=Myron|date=October 12, 1999|website=Howard Lake Herald &amp; Winsted-Lester Prairie Journal|publisher=|access-date=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the "Hamburger Charlie", and Nagreen's creation was sold at the festival until his death in 1951. To this day, his accomplishment is celebrated annually with a "Burger Fest" in his honor in his hometown of Seymour.

Another alleged inventor of the hamburger is the cook Fletcher Davis (better known as "Old Dave"), who claimed to have had the idea of putting ground beef between two pieces of Texas Toast when one of his customers was in too much of a hurry to sit down for a meal. The customer walked away with his Hamburger Steak and seemed so content that Old Dave offered his new carryout meal as a staple menu item at the end of 1880 in [[Athens, Texas]]. Fletcher had a stall with his wife at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair]] of 1904. Texan journalist [[Frank X. Tolbert]] mentions a salesman named Fletcher Davis who served hamburgers in a café at 115 Tyler Street in Athens during the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxISAQAAIAAJ|title=Tolbert's Texas|last=Tolbert|first=Frank X.|date=|publisher=Doubleday|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=130–136|language=en|chapter=The Henderson county hamburger|quote=|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ksis9IrRp4C|title=The New Food Lover's Companion: More Than 6,700 A-to-Z Entries Describe Foods, Cooking Techniques, Herbs, Spices, Desserts, Wines, and the Ingredients for Pleasurable Dining|last=Herbst|first=Sharon Tyler|last2=Herbst|first2=Ron|date=|publisher=Barron's snippet|year=2007|isbn=9780764135774|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locals claim that Davis was selling beef sandwiches during that time, without having a clear name for his invention. During the 1980s, the [[Dairy Queen]] [[ice cream]] chain filmed a documentary about the birthplace of the hamburger featuring Davis' story. The story of "Old Dave's Hamburger Sandwich" is also found mentioned in Ronald L. McDonald's book ''The Complete Hamburger''.&lt;ref name="rlmcdonald" /&gt;

In the same year that Charlie Nagreen claimed to have developed his "Hamburger Charlie", the brothers and street cooks Frank and Charles Menches of [[Akron, Ohio]] claimed to have sold a ground beef [[sandwich]] at the [[Erie County Fair]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They assert that the name of the hamburger was derived from the town [[Hamburg (town), New York|Hamburg]], New York in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the first place in which it had been sold. This statement has been very poorly documented or substantiated, and in the case of an oral tradition, it is not without its contradictions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Its famous description of the [[secret ingredient]]s used in the recipes, such as coffee or [[brown sugar]], is primitive.

Another version of the creation of the hamburger is that of German cook Otto Kuasw, who created a very popular sailors' sandwich made of a fillet of beef patty fried in butter, served with a [[fried egg]], between two [[toast|toasted buns]] in 1891, at a post in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The sandwich was called the "Deutsches Beefsteak", German for "German beefsteak". Many of the sailors traveling on ships between Hamburg and New York requested a similar "Hamburg style" sandwich at American steakhouses.

There are many additional claims as to the origin of the hamburger. Some enthusiasts claim the hamburger could have been created in São Gonçalo, a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, in the 18th century by a Chef named Sauerbrown "Little" Victor, but this claim has no supporting evidence to back the opinion. A local newspaper claims that Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant who arrived in America in 1880, sold butter and eggs as a street vendor. In 1974, in an [[interview]] with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he recounted how he created a hamburger steak sandwich with small strips of beef for a restaurant known as [[Louis' Lunch]]. Lassen's family claims 1900 as the year of his invention. Revealed in a public confrontation between the grandson of Louis, Kenneth Davis Lassen Fletch, and his uncle, documentation signed under notary in 1900 demonstrates the development of the hamburger, as it stresses the difference between a "hamburger steak" and a "hamburger sandwich".&lt;ref&gt;Review Staff.

===Ingredients===
[[File:In-N-Out Burger cheeseburger meal.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The modern hamburger with its familiar sides, French fries and a drink]]
Hamburg steak, once served between two loaves of bread, began to be prepared with a variety of different ingredients that were included either in the sandwich itself or as a side dish accompanying it on a plate. One of these accompaniments, which is still common with today's burger, is [[ketchup]], a type of [[tomato sauce]] with a blend of [[flavor]]s between [[sweet]] and [[sour]] that was first produced commercially in 1869 by entrepreneur and chef [[Henry John Heinz]] in [[Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania]]. His company was originally called the ''Anchor Pickle and Vinegar Works'', but in 1888 it was renamed [[H. J. Heinz Company|F. &amp; J. Heinz]].&lt;ref name="Kurlansky"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Kurlansky, Mark | title=Salt: A World History | year=2003 | publisher = Penguin | isbn=978-0-8027-1373-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ketchup by American consumers grew quickly after this date, and it was not long before hamburgers were almost universally accompanied by ketchup by the end of the nineteenth and into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Giovanni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rozin" /&gt; [[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] is a significantly older [[condiment]], as it is thought that the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] used a dressing made with non-fermented grapes and [[grape seed]]s known as "mustum ardens".&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{Cite book|author= McGee, Harold |title= On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |edition= rev. |year= 2004| publisher= Scribner |location= New York |isbn= 0-684-80001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ingredient incorporated into the burger, [[mayonnaise]], appears to have been present in 18th century France, after the naval victory of [[Louis-François-Armand du Plessis de Richelieu]] in the port of [[Mahón]] in [[Menorca]] around 1756.&lt;ref&gt;David, E. (1960). "French Provincial Cooking" (1999 edition) p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the vegetables that come with the hamburger, the first described in the literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings.&lt;ref name="ilustra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt; Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product, whether that be lettuce (as in the case of the [[BLT sandwich]]), [[sauerkraut]] (as on the [[reuben sandwich|reuben]]), [[coleslaw]], or [[pickled cucumber|pickles]]. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more "natural" appearance and taste.&lt;ref name="Rozin" /&gt; All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Rozin" /&gt; In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of [[Tex-Mex]] style burgers, which are served with a side of [[chili con carne]].

[[French fries]] are an invention of the [[Low Countries]],&lt;ref name="Jo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Smith, Andrew F. |title= Encyclopedia of junk food and fast food |edition= 1st |year= 2006 |publisher= Greenwood Press |isbn= 0-313-33527-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Belgian historian Jo Gerard mentions that they originated around 1680 in both Belgium and the [[Spanish Netherlands]], specifically in the area of "the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse valley]] between [[Dinant]] and [[Liège]]". The people of this region used to prepare meals with small amounts of [[fried fish]], but when the river froze over and fishing became impossible, they would cut up potatoes and fry them in [[animal fat|animal oil]].&lt;ref name="Jo"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Gerard, Jo |title= La Belgique 1830–1980 |edition= 1st |year= 1979 |publisher= Meddens |location= Brussels |language= French |isbn= 2-87013-035-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; French fries were introduced as a [[snack]] in American cafés during the early 19th century,&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; but they did not become popular until large fast food companies such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]] incorporated them into their menus during the mid-20th century. The improvements in [[frozen food|potato freezing]] technology made by [[J.R. Simplot]] of [[Idaho City]] in 1953, made the large scale production of French fries possible. Before the potatoes were frozen, however, they had still lost some of their flavor during frying, but new processes such as a further improved Simplot invention avoided this inconvenience by 1967, largely thanks to the use of a mixture of cow [[tallow]] and [[soybean oil]].&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; This allowed Simplot and McDonald's founder [[Ray Kroc]] to collaborate, resulting in ready-peeled potatoes from Simplot's farms being delivered directly to McDonald's kitchens, where they were fried and served to customers. Initially, however, there were safety concerns raised over some fries and the kitchens in which they were prepared, leading some companies, such as [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], to remove them from their menus during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, a new generation of [[cola]] emerged, a beverage that would soon join beer as the most traditional drinks served alongside the hamburger. The first recipe for [[Coca-Cola]] was invented in 1885 in [[Columbus, Georgia]] by grocer [[John Pemberton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Pendergrast, Mark | authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |title= An unauthorized history traces the evolution of Coca-Cola from its quiet beginnings to the influential giant of today |edition= 1st |year= 1979 |publisher= Collier Books |location= New York |isbn= 0-684-82679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called [[coca wine]] (the trademark was "Pemberton's French Wine Coca"), it may have been inspired by the formidable success of [[Vin Mariani]], a European coca wine. In the late 19th century, it was sold as a [[bottle]]d [[soft drink]] in most of the United States. In the early 20th century, another beverage, [[Pepsi]], was created by [[pharmacist]] [[Caleb Bradham]] and quickly came to rival the sales of Coca-Cola. [[Strategic alliance]]s between large burger restaurant chains and these two soft drink companies greatly increased the beverages' availability to the general public.

==Commercialization==
[[File:Mass-produced hamburgers.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The hamburger solved the technical problem of mass-producing semi-processed food.]]
The dawn of the 20th century witnessed the need to provide food for people living in highly productive urban centers with high population densities. Food also had to be economically affordable for the working class in order for them to maintain their [[Employment|labor]] and industrial production. The burger was born in a time when people needed to eat both "fast" and "cheap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Grew, Raymond |title= Food In Global History |edition= 1st |year= 2000 |publisher= Westview Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-8133-3884-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advances in the field of [[food preservation]], as well as improvements in agricultural production and transportation, made it possible for hamburgers to be a practical choice of food for urban dwellers since their very creation. The [[socio-economic]] environment of the United States at the time of the burger's rise to popularity coincided with the end of World War I and the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] of 1929. This environment was particularly favorable for fostering inexpensive food, which was one reason why five-cent hamburgers were so popular. After its invention during the first decade of the 20th century, the hamburger came to be marketed on a large scale, after "visionaries" realized that it would benefit greatly from a mass production process.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt;

The first automobile [[production line]] was created by [[Karl Benz]] in Germany in 1888. The widespread appearance of telephones occurred at the beginning of the 20th century, along with other modern means of communication, including radio. For the average American who had not eaten in a restaurant in his or her entire life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Pillsbury, Richard |title= From Boarding House to Bistro: The American Restaurant Then and Now |edition= 1st |year= 1990 |publisher= Unwin Hyman |isbn= 0-04-445680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fast food chains that appeared in the cities offered an alternative form of restaurant in which eating was very much a public activity. The concept of a "[[greasy spoon]]" was thus born with these restaurants{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, in which [[hygiene]] suffered in exchange for more inexpensive food. On the other hand, there was a growing [[interconnected]] world in which trips by car, bus, and rail became increasingly available. All these means of transport were improving at the time, and soon it was necessary to feed a growing population that was "in permanent transit", frequently moving through different cities [[business travel|on business]].&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fast Food, Fast Track: Immigrants, Big Business, And The American Dream|date=July 2003|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0-8133-4155-8|edition=1st|location=New York|author=Talwar, Jennifer Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlosser" /&gt; [[George Pullman]] invented the [[sleeping car]] and the [[dining car]] in response to the needs of these people in the 1870s. Similarly, the English immigrant [[Fred Harvey (entrepreneur)|Frederick Henry Harvey]] was the first to use "dynamic mass movement" in restoring the [[Fred Harvey Company]], which catered to the patrons of a chain of hotels located near railway stations, as well as offering catering, services, and high quality products on the trains themselves.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt;

Contemporary American society also witnessed the creation of new fast foods that originated from the traditional cuisine of various ethnic groups from around the world. For example, [[German Americans|German immigrant]] Charles Feltman invented the [[hot dog]] in 1867 in his stall in [[Coney Island]], New York by pairing a [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a bread bun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Bly, Robert W. |title= All-American Frank: A History of the Hot Dog |edition= 1st |year= 2007 |publisher= PublishAmerica |location= New York |isbn= 1-4137-5062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitators such as Harry Magley and Charles Stevens soon began selling hot dogs at [[New York Yankees|New York Polo Grounds]] baseball games. Similarly, [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrants]] sold [[ice cream]] from vending carts in the streets or pasta at their restaurants. [[Chinese Americans|Chinese immigrants]] initially opened restaurants to cater to their fellow Chinese-Americans, but they gradually became accepted by the American clientele, sometimes resulting in truly Chinese-American cuisine such as [[chop suey]]. In this diverse world of ethnic foods, the hamburger was able to rise to mainstream popularity and become a national food of the United States.

===White Castle System===
{{Main|White Castle (restaurant)}}
[[File:White Castle Building No. 8.jpg|250px|thumb|The 1936 [[White Castle Building No. 8]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]]]

On November 16, 1916, chef and entrepreneur Walter "Walt" Anderson opened a hamburger stand in [[Wichita, Kansas]] that used hygienic cooking methods, including [[grilling|grills]] and [[spatula]]s, and impressed his Wichita customers so much that many would become regular patrons. At this time, the hamburger was still not widely known by the American public. Anderson added [[onion ring]]s to the burgers while they grilled, giving them a distinctive flavor.&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt; As demand increased, customers often bought his hamburgers by the [[dozen]], giving rise to the company's subsequently popular [[slogan]]: "buy 'em by the sack". Despite some growth, Anderson had opened only four stands in the busiest areas of the city. In 1926, Edgar Waldo "Billy" Ingram collaborated with Anderson to open the first [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle restaurant]] in Wichita. The restaurant was founded on the idea of cooking a hamburger quickly, giving it the honor of being the first [[fast food restaurant]].

Ingram soon realized that the word ''burger'' evoked connotations of [[circus]] performances at livestock markets and greasy pieces of meat eaten in the poorest districts of the city in the collective mind of the American public. He tried to change those connotations from White Castle's earliest days. At the same time, he became known to some as the [[Henry Ford]] of the hamburger,&lt;ref name="Ozersky" /&gt; while inventing a restaurant concept he called the "White Castle System", which helped the hamburger achieve fame.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt; Between 1923 and 1931, the "White Castle System" established almost a hundred restaurants in cities throughout the [[Midwestern United States]]. In order to raise awareness among White Castle employees, a [[newsletter]] entitled "The hot hamburger" was circulated throughout the company, which challenged the employees to improve the sale of the burgers with a simple idea: to be able to prepare burgers rapidly so anyone could purchase and eat them anytime and anywhere. Instead of waiting for half an hour to be served at a traditional restaurant, the White Castle System provided rapid service and a menu centered around the hamburger. At the time, the hamburger was typically served with coffee.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt; [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' had already caused public outrage over the safety of processed meat, so by the 1920s, the general public had come to expect a clean and hygienic hamburger. In addition to offering clean and safe food, White Castle offered regularity and standardization, ensuring that each patty was served in the same manner in each restaurant. At the time, this was an entirely novel idea that would revolutionize the sale of food itself with a style that would come to be known as fast food.&lt;ref name="selling"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Hogan, David |title= Selling 'em by the Sack: White Castle and the Creation of American Food |edition= 1st |year= 1997 |publisher= NYU Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-8147-3566-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its early years, White Castle emphasized providing quality coffee, and collaborated with universities to publish studies on the nutritional quality of their hamburgers.

The success of the White Castle chain was rooted largely in the power of propaganda, something that was both an original innovation and necessary to change the public's negative perception of the hamburger.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt; In 1931, it became the first restaurant to [[newspaper advertisement|advertise in newspapers]], using its old "buy 'em by the sack" slogan. White Castle also pioneered the concept of [[take-out]] service, and the restaurant is further known for being the first to market square burgers, called "[[slider (sandwich)|sliders]]", which were sold for five cents into the 1940s.&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt; White Castle was founded in March 1921 in Wichita, Kansas by Billy Ingram and his business partner, the cook Walter Anderson, and they opened a second restaurant in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in 1924. In 1932, White Castle created its first subsidiary: Paperlynen Company, which provided the [[carton]]s and [[wrapping paper]] that the food was served in, as well as the hats worn by the kitchen staff. It acquired [[porcelain]] companies in a similar fashion, placing them in charge of building small White Castle restaurants using white porcelain facades.

Walter Anderson contributed a number of novel ideas to White Castle during its early years, including the creation of a special [[spatula]] and a special bread for the burgers. In 1949, an employee named Earl Howell calculated the amount of time that it took to break hamburgers apart in a presentable fashion, eventually leading him to create the [[perforated]] burger. By 1951, White Castle had incorporated five perforations into its burgers.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ingram, E. W. |title= All This from a 5-cent Hamburger! The Story of the White Castle System |edition= 1st |year= 1964 |publisher= The Newcomen Society |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Anderson, hamburgers were cooked on a grill for an indefinite period of time and minced meat balls were "crushed" into conventional [[sliced bread|slices of bread]], like a sandwich. The meat was frozen and hamburgers came to be cooked from frozen, instead of using fresh meat. White Castle revolutionized the burger-making process by regularizing the finished products and using hygienic preparation techniques that were in clear view of the customers.&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt;

White Castle had a very large progression of sales, and its success was such, that by 1926, it had already generated competitors and [[imitator]]s in the emerging hamburger business. One of these imitators also had a highly similar name, [[White Tower Hamburgers]] of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], founded by the father and son tandem of John E. and Thomas E. Saxe. The creation of White Tower led to numerous legal battles between it and White Castle during the 1930s. By 1930, White Castle already had 116 restaurants spread over a distance of {{convert|2,300|km|mi}}, all of which were located within the United States. [1] The company eventually became a large restaurant chain, however, there has never been a restaurant outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The American [[shortage]] of beef during World War II had little effect on sales across White Castle, due to the effect of [[vertical integration]] along with the appearance of fast food chains that operated on a [[franchising|franchise]] model that emphasized [[horizontal integration]].&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt;

===McDonald's era===
[[File:Find the differences (painting by Peter Klashorst).jpg|350px|thumb|In the 1960s, McDonald's advertised the ability of a customer to eat the same burger anywhere in the United States, and a few decades later it made the same feat possible in much of the world.]]
{{Main|McDonald's}}
In 1937, Patrick McDonald and his two sons [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|Richard and Maurice]] inaugurated the simple restaurant "Airdrome" on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the airport in the American city of [[Monrovia, California#History|Monrovia, California]]. The success of its sales eventually led to the May 15, 1940, opening of a restaurant named [[McDonald's]] along [[U.S. Route 66]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]. After analyzing their sales, the brothers discovered that, to their surprise, 80% of their [[revenue]] was coming from selling hamburgers.&lt;ref name="Kroc" /&gt; The menu initially featured 25 different dishes, the majority of which were [[barbecue]]d. Through their new restaurant, the McDonald brothers introduced the notion of fast food to parts of the Western United States by 1948. From the beginning, McDonald's focused on making hot dogs and hamburgers as efficiently and quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Arcs"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Love, John F. |title= McDonald's: Behind The Arches |edition= 1st |year= 1995 |publisher= Bantam; Rev Sub edition |location= New York |isbn= 0-553-34759-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroc" /&gt; During the 1940s, simple and formative concepts took root at McDonald's, including the preparation and service of burgers in just one minute and the ability for customers to eat in their own cars in a ''[[drive-in]]'' style. All the while, the restaurant was trying to further develop a hamburger that was inexpensive enough to be within the economic reach of most Americans. By the 1950s, the concept of drive-in style service had become firmly established and hamburgers and cars had become closely connected in the minds of many Americans. It was now not only possible for a customer to purchase a hamburger without getting out of a car, and a customer also no longer needed to wait to be served.&lt;ref name="Arcs" /&gt; The McDonald brothers built upon the achievements of their original San Bernardino restaurant when in 1953 they began franchising their now famous chain restaurants, starting in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Downey, California]] (the latter of which is [[Oldest McDonald's restaurant|still in operation]]). Later, [[Ray Kroc]] opened one in the northwest Chicago suburb of [[Des Plaines, Illinois]] on April 15, 1955, which has now been converted into the [[McDonald's USA First Store Museum|McDonald's Museum]].&lt;ref name="Arcs" /&gt; It is noteworthy that the original McDonald's [[mascot]] was a hamburger faced cook called "[[Speedee]]" that would serve as the iconographic identity of the company until being replaced by the clown [[Ronald McDonald]] in 1963.

The McDonald brothers intensively studied the existing kitchen protocol of their restaurants in an effort to improve them. They looked at different options that could increase the speed of cooking hamburgers, designing and patenting special [[grilling|grills]] that had a higher output, made their [[cutlery]] and other [[kitchen utensil]]s [[disposable]], and introduced [[dishwasher]]s that reduced the costs of water, soap, and [[Employment|labor]]. The brothers also created a detailed system for operating each kitchen throughout the franchise in a similar and largely standardized manner, as well as recruiting adolescents as employees in the kitchens.&lt;ref name="Arcs" /&gt;

The company began to expand at a much faster rate when 52-year-old ice cream machinery salesman [[Ray Kroc]] took over as its chief executive.&lt;ref name="Kroc"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Kroc, Ray |author2=Robert Anderson |title= Grinding it out |edition= 2nd |year= 1987 |publisher= St.Martins Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-312-92987-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kroc was the initiator of both McDonald's expansion across the United States and the definitive standardization of its burgers. He was not alone, however, as some of his co-workers were also very productive and innovative. McDonald's executive and [[food scientist]] [[Herb Peterson]] invented the [[McMuffin]] in 1972 and also the now famous greeting, "May I have your order, please?". In another key development, [[Jim Delligatti]] of the [[Pittsburgh]] franchise invented the [[Big Mac]] in 1967. The McDonald's successful expansion was mainly due to its use of the franchise system, an innovation borrowed from a sewing machine manufacturer, the [[Singer Corporation]]. Singer had developed it during the late 19th century, and it was so successful that it was soon adopted by its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Langdon, Philip |title= Orange Roofs, Golden Arches |edition= 1st |year= 1986 |publisher= Knopf |location= New York |isbn= 0-394-74129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, McDonald's even has its own university for training its staff: [[Hamburger University]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]]. Graduates receive a degree entitled "bachelor of hamburgerology with a minor in French fries".&lt;ref name="Ries" /&gt; As McDonald's expanded into other countries, it encountered more opposition and general difficulties, as was the case in 1996 when it opened a restaurant in New Delhi amid outcry from Indian leaders.&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{Cite book|editor= Watson, James |title= Golden Arches East: McDonald's in East Asia |edition= 2nd |year= 2006 |publisher= Stanford University Press |isbn= 0-8047-4989-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the country with the most McDonald's restaurants (aside from the United States) was Japan, followed by Canada and Germany, while the company itself had restaurants in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref name="Asia" /&gt; Throughout its history, the company has become a symbol of [[globalization]] and [[Western culture]], sometimes resulting in it being the subject of [[anger]] and protests in various parts of the world.&lt;ref name="McGlobal" /&gt;

===Variants===
[[File:Veganburger.jpeg|300px|thumb|left|A [[vegan]] version of the hamburger]]
Many different variants of the hamburger have been created over the years, some of which have become very popular. Much of this diversity has been the product of other restaurant chains that have tried to reproduce the success of McDonald's and White Castle, while others served to influence McDonald's. An example of a restaurant that influenced McDonald's and its imitators is [[Big Boy (restaurant)|Big Boy]], which was first opened in 1936 by [[Bob Wian]] in [[Glendale, California]] and became known in that locale as [[Bob's Big Boy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob's Big Boy of Burbank menu, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this restaurant that a major hamburger variant, the double deck cheeseburger, with two beef patties, was first made. Wian's creation was distinctively served by Big Boy restaurants with the bun sliced twice, the center slice—known as the club section—separating the two patties. The chain also popularized the drive-in restaurant format, taken and simplified by McDonald's type fast food operators. By the 1960s, Big Boy had expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Despite the benefits it provided to Wian, the chain was sold along with the rights to their signature Big Boy hamburger to the [[Marriott Corporation]] in 1967. This same year McDonald's franchisee Jim Delligatti, created an imitation of the Big Boy — the Big Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/jim-delligatti-who-gave-the-world-the-big-mac-sandwich-dies-at-98/2016/11/30/94923ad6-b719-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html|title=Jim Delligatti, who gave the world the Big Mac sandwich, dies at 98|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=November 30, 2016|work=|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|quote=The Big Mac became the chain burger by which all subsequent ones have been measured. But Mr. Delligatti, who spent some years in Southern California, acknowledged a debt to Bob Wian, who operated a Glendale, Calif., hamburger stand and crafted a similar double-decker burger in the late 1930s that became the signature item of Bob’s Big Boy restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;{{in5}}'This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,' Mr. Delligatti later told the ''Los Angeles Times''. 'The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.'&amp;nbsp;|access-date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the many McDonald's and White Castle imitators is [[Kewpee Hamburgers]], a fast-food chain founded in 1923 in [[Flint, Michigan]] by Samuel V. Blair as "[[Kewpee|Kewpee Hotel Hamburgs]]."&lt;ref name="selling" /&gt;

As with the invention of the hamburger, the exact origins of the [[cheeseburger]] are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. [[Lionel Sternberger]] of Rite Spot in [[Pasadena, California]] takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926.&lt;ref name="Rozin"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Rozin, Elisabeth |title= The Primal Cheeseburger: A Generous Helping of Food History Served On a Bun |edition= 1st |year= 1994 |publisher= Penguin Books |location= New York |isbn= 0-14-017843-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A description from a 1928 menu from the [[O'Dell Restaurant]] in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time.&lt;ref name="Edge" /&gt; Luis Ballast, owner of the Humpty Dumpty drive-in restaurant in [[Denver]], Colorado, made an attempt to create a cheeseburger with a [[registered trademark]] known as a "yellowburger" in 1935. J.C. Reynolds, the operator of a bar in [[Southern California]] from 1932 to 1984, popularized a [[pimento]] burger.&lt;ref name="Edge" /&gt; [[Processed cheese]], the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers, was invented in 1911 by Walter Gerber of [[Thun]], Switzerland, although the first U.S. patent awarded for it was given to [[James L. Kraft]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.emmi-fondue.ch/firma-f/firma-ents.htm |title = Emmi Fondue AG&amp;nbsp;– Firma&amp;nbsp;– Entstehung: |publisher = Emmi Fondue AG |accessdate = August 11, 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701032319/http://www.emmi-fondue.ch/firma-f/firma-ents.htm |archivedate = July 1, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KraftPatent"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kraft.com/100/innovations/kraftcheese.html |title=Patent reference at Kraft Foods |publisher=Kraft Foods |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609232852/http://www.kraft.com/100/innovations/kraftcheese.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraft Foods]] went on to create the first commercial version of sliced processed cheese, which was first introduced to the market in 1950.

After World War II, a number of hamburger restaurants known as InstaBurger King (later [[Burger King]]) began emerging, the first of which was opened on December 4, 1954 in a suburb of Miami, Florida. It was established by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], both of whom were students at the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= McLamore, James W. |title= The Burger King: Jim McLamore and the Building of an Empire |edition= 1st |date=October 1997 |publisher= Mcgraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-045255-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLamore had visited the original McDonald's in San Bernardino, California when it was still owned by the McDonald brothers, and saw the potential that existed for the [[mass production]] of hamburgers. He was so inspired by this visit that he decided to create a similar burger chain himself. By 1959, Burger King already had five restaurants in [[Miami metropolitan area|metropolitan Miami]], and its early success prompted McLamore and Edgerton to expand throughout the United States by using a [[franchising|franchise system]] that allowed them to grow the business at a relatively low cost. They formed Burger King Corporation as a parent company to the franchises they were selling throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king |title=History of Burger King Corporation |author=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com FundingUniverse.com] |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [62] The Burger King Corporation was acquired by the [[Pillsbury Company]] in 1967, and during the 1970s, it began to expand outside the United States, principally in South America and Europe. [[Burger King]]'s core product has long been the [[Whopper]], which was created in 1957 by founder James McLamore and initially sold for 37 cents.&lt;ref name="whopper"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr2-28-02bk.html |title=Burger King Celebrates As The WHOPPER Turns 45 |author=Burger King Corporation |publisher=BizJournals on Bison.com |date=February 8, 2002 |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019160640/http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr2-28-02bk.html |archivedate=October 19, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wendy's]] was founded by [[Dave Thomas (American businessman)|Dave Thomas]] and [[John T. Schuessler]] on November 15, 1969 in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. By the late 1970s, it had become the third largest hamburger company in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/McDonald%27s?cat=biz-fin |title=McDonald's |author=Hoovers.com |publisher=answers.com |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/corporation/facts.aspx |title=Burger King Domestic and Global facts |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521063359/http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/corporation/facts.aspx |archivedate=May 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy's has consistently tried to [[product differentiation|differentiate]] itself from other hamburger restaurants by its claim that it makes its burgers using fresh, not frozen, beef. Wendy's sparked a [[controversy]] and entered into American [[popular culture|pop culture]] in the 1980s with its "[[Where's the beef?]]" advertising slogan and an accompanying campaign stressing the primacy of the beef patty over the hamburger's other ingredients.

==Culinary myth==
[[File:Popeye-meets-ali-baba crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[J. Wellington Wimpy]] (Wimpy), on the left one of [[Popeye]]'s friends from a 1937 cartoon, had a tremendous craving for hamburgers.]]
The hamburger was very popular among Americans during the [[interwar period|postwar period]] following World War I,&lt;ref name="Schlosser" /&gt; even in popular culture. An example of this was the prominent appearance of hamburgers in [[E. C. Segar]]'s ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' [[comic strip]], which prominently featured a [[cartoon character]] named [[Popeye the Sailor]] who ate [[spinach]] to sustain his superhuman strength. Popeye's first appearance was as a [[supporting character]] on January 17, 1929 alongside many other characters. One of these characters was [[J. Wellington Wimpy]] (often shortened to just "Wimpy"), a lover of hamburgers who was both polite and gluttonous. His signature phrase, "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today", became popular and widely known. During the height of his popularity in the 1930s, Wimpy introduced the hamburger to the youth of the time as a healthy food. It also resulted in the creation of a chain of fast food restaurants called [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy's]] in his honor, which sold hamburgers for ten cents.&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; In a similar fashion, the fictional character [[Jughead Jones]], who first appeared in [[Archie Comics]] in 1941, was passionate about food generally, and hamburgers specifically.

Fictional characters related to the hamburger, such as the [[Ronald McDonald]] [[clown]] character designed by [[Willard Scott]] who first appeared on television in 1963,&lt;ref name=heavyweights&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_iz/episode/0,3195,FOOD_31138_56604,00.html | title=Big Burger Business: McDonald's and Burger King | series=Heavyweights | network=[[Food Network]] | airdate=2009-02-27 | season=2 | number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon became a recognizable part of [[American culture]]. The burger also made appearances in [[underground comix]] such as [[Zap Comix#2]] during the late 1960s, in which cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]] designed a character called "Hamburger Hi-Jinx". By the end of the decade, [[pop art]] was including the hamburger as an artistic element, appearing in the works of [[Andy Warhol]] (''Dual Hamburger''), [[Claes Oldenburg]] (''Floor Burger''), [[Mel Ramos]] (''Vinaburger'', 1965), and more recently, [[David LaChapelle]] (''Death by Hamburger'', 2002).

An example of the popularity and identification that the burger enjoyed among the American public was the name of the [[Battle of Hamburger Hill]], which occurred in May 1969 during the [[Vietnam War]]. Its name was inspired by the number of American and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] casualties, which made the scene resembles a "butcher".&lt;ref&gt;Zaffiri, Samuel, (1988), ''Hamburger Hill, May 10–20, 1969'', {{ISBN|0-89141-706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hamburger was also the inspiration of [[Star Wars]] creator [[George Lucas]]'s design for the [[Millennium Falcon]] ship.&lt;ref name="SW.comBTS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/millenniumfalcon/?id=bts |title=Star Wars: Databank: Millennium Falcon (Behind the Scenes) |publisher=starwars.com |accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburgers also appear in computer games, as in the case of [[BurgerTime]], an [[arcade game|arcade-style game]] created in 1982 by [[Data East|Data East Corporation]]. The hamburger also appears prominently on [[Television in the United States|American television]] shows such as ''[[American Eats]]'' and ''[[Man v. Food]]''.

By the 1960s, American society had become highly [[automobile|motorized]], largely due to the 1956 [[Federal Highway Act]] passed by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and inspired by the [[German Autobahn]], as well as the impressive growth rates of American [[automobile manufacturer]]s at the time.&lt;ref name="rlmcdonald" /&gt; Due to the extensive use of cars at the time, hamburgers were often served at [[drive-in]]s, often by waiters known as [[carhop]]s. Drive-in restaurants first appeared in the United States in the early 1930s, and gradually become a common sight across the country. The ability to serve hamburgers to customers in their cars was seen as a business opportunity by countless fast-food chains, especially [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref name="Arcs" /&gt; The popularity of the hamburger grew rapidly among the American population during this period, and statistics indicate that the average American was eating three burgers per week.&lt;ref name="amer" /&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the hamburger became a [[national symbol]] of the United States. As private outdoor social events, often held in [[backyard]]s and featuring a [[barbecue]], became more widespread during the mid-1950s, the hamburger gained a new culinary and social relevance in the country.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{Cite book|author= McDonald, Ronald L. |title= The complete hamburger: The History of America's Favorite Sandwich |edition= 1st |year= 1997 |publisher= Citadel |location= London |isbn= 1-55972-407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decsy" /&gt; By the late 1960s, hamburgers began to grow in size as various burger chains competed with each other, resulting in Burger King launching the [[Whopper]] and [[McDonald's]] launching the [[Quarter Pounder]]. As the race between the major chains grew more intense, the prices of their burgers increased, and the days when a hamburger could be bought for just a few cents were numbered.

In the 1970s, major hamburger chains began to use considerable resources in marketing their products. They began to compete directly with each other through their advertising, much of which was [[comparative advertising|comparative]] and often featured direct [[allusion]]s and comparisons.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ries, Al |author2=Jack Trout |title= Marketing Warfare |edition= 1st |year= 1997 |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location= New York |isbn= 0-07-052726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event came to be jokingly referred to as the "[[Burger wars|burger wars]]" by many Americans. By the end of the 1980s, the era of [[slogan]]s in large chain restaurants had begun.

==Global phenomenon==
[[File:Taiwan McDonald's chicken rice burger 20050218.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Vietnamese [[riceburger]] is a product of the globalization of the hamburger.]]

The modern hamburger was developed in the United States, but by the end of World War II, around the middle of the 20th century, it began to spread to other countries as fast food became [[globalization|globalized]].&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt; The main cause of this gradual globalization was the successes of the large [[restaurant chain]]s. Their desires to expand their businesses and increase their profits resulted in them creating [[Chain store|franchises]] around the world.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Inglis, David |title= The Globalization of Food |edition= 1st |year= 2009 |publisher= Berg Publishers |isbn= 1-84520-820-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] was among the very first of the burger chains to take the global establishment of its brand seriously,&lt;ref name="McGlobal"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Ritzer, George |title= The McDonaldization of Society 5 |edition= 5th |year= 2007 |publisher= Pine Forge Press |isbn= 1-4129-5430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not the only one. [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]] began operating in the United Kingdom in 1954, 20 years before McDonald's began operation in the country, and by 1970 it had expanded to over a thousand restaurants in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |title=Wimpy Moments |publisher=wimpy.uk.com |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122138/http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 1971, in [[Zaandam]], near [[Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands, [[Ahold]] opened its first European franchise. In the 1970s, McDonald's began to expand into Europe and Australia. In Asia, Japan saw the establishment of its own fast food chain in 1972: {{Nihongo|[[MOS Burger]]|モスバーガー|Mosu bāgā}}, an abbreviation of "Mountain, Ocean, Sun", which eventually became a direct competitor to McDonald's. All of its products, however, were variations on the burger adapted to the Asian world, including the teriyaki burger, takumi burger, and [[riceburger]].&lt;ref name="BigIndex"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Cwiertka, Katarzyna J. |title= Modern Japanese Cuisine: Food, Power and National Identity |edition= 1st |date=May 2007 |publisher= Reaktion Books (illustrated version) |isbn= 1-86189-298-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, [[Aji Ichiban]] competed with large chains before it spread quickly throughout Asia.&lt;ref name="Asia" /&gt; One of the first hamburger [[vending machine]]s debuted in Amsterdam in 1941 under the brand ''[[FEBO]]'', its name derived from its original place of creation, the [[Ferdinand Bolstraat]].

At the same time the hamburger was growing in popularity around the world, it took on a variety of local features in different locations. Such examples of this include ground meat made from local animals, such as [[kangaroo]]s in Australia,&lt;ref name="Austr"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loffler, Don |title= Capital Taste: the A-Z of Good Food in and around Canberra |edition= 1st |year= 1997 |publisher= Wakefield Press |isbn= 1-86254-416-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tex-Mex]]-style dishes like [[chilli con carne]].

The expansion and standardization of the hamburger has led to the creation of a price index that can be used as an economic reference between different countries known as the [[Big Mac Index]]. It measures the worth (in US$) of a burger in different parts of the world, allowing for the comparison of the [[purchasing power parity]] of 120 national economies in which McDonald's does business.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ong, Li Lian |title= The Big Mac Index: Applications of Purchasing Power Parity |edition= 1st |date=May 2003 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |isbn= 1-4039-0310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[George Ritzer]] coined the related concept of "[[McDonaldization]]" in his 1995 book ''McDonaldization of Society.''&lt;ref name="McGlobal" /&gt; Another byproduct of the globalization of fast food was the creation of international [[competitive eating]] contests that involve contestants from many different countries. One of the best known is the [[Krystal Square Off]], run by the fast-food chain [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] and sponsored by the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOC), which has been held annually since 2004.

==Present day==

In the 20th century, the hamburger has appeared as the central topic in some books on the literature of culinary topics. An example of this is ''[[Fast Food Nation|Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal]]'', published by [[investigative journalist]] [[Eric Schlosser]] in 2001, that examines the local and global influence of the American fast food industry.&lt;ref name="Schlosser"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Schlosser, Eric |title= Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal |edition= 2nd |date=January 2002 |publisher= Harper Perennial |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-093845-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a modern variation of the hamburger is the so-called ''gourmet burger'', which is made by [[haute cuisine]] chefs with patties that include [[luxury good|luxury]] ingredients. One of the first such burgers was cooked in New York City by chef [[Daniel Boulud]] in June 2001, and subsequently sold for US$29 with [[loin]], ribs Bres, canned [[black truffle]]s, and a [[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]] of vegetables. The [[Manhattan]] restaurant "Old Homestead", one of the oldest [[steakhouse]]s in the country, offers a $44 hamburger with beef-bred Japanese [[wagyū]].&lt;ref name="Edge" /&gt; An haute cuisine burger created by [[Richard Blais]], a student of [[Ferran Adrià]], was introduced in 2004 at a restaurant in [[Atlanta]], where it is served with a crystal chain and a silk [[ribbon]]. In response to the haute cuisine take on the hamburger, others have created more humble versions. Alberto Chicote of [[Madrid]] makes homemade hamburgers in his kitchen, using [[Iberia]]n pork along with homemade [[ketchup]] and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.diariodenoticias.com/ediciones/2006/07/29/sociedad/navarra/d29nav10.656412.php |title= La tradición estadounidense y la cocina fusión ponen el punto y final al simposio gastronómico |accessdate=23 March 2009 |language= Spanish |date= July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Max Schondor created a hamburger made of soy. In a 2005 episode of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], the adventurous title character visits [[Mr. Krabs]]'s popular [[Krabby Patty]] burgers, where hamburgers figure prominently in the story.

In the United States during the 20th century, there have been numerous celebrations marking the centenary of the burger. Two locations in particular organized high-profile events to celebrate 100 years of the hamburger. One was held in [[Athens, Texas]] in November 2006, in honor of Fletcher Davis. In a resolution made by the State of Texas, it was established that Athens is the "Original Home of Hamburger". However, in August 2007, the state of [[Wisconsin]] made the same claim on behalf of the town of [[Seymour, Wisconsin|Seymour]], the home of [[Charlie Nagreen]] who also claimed to be the creator of the hamburger.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; These two decisions have split the honor of creating the hamburger between these two American cities. The town of Seymour continues to annually celebrate a "Burger Fest" on the first Saturday of each August.

===Nutritional controversies===
Since the latter part of the 20th century, the burger has undergone several [[controversy|controversies]] regarding its nutritional values. In an era in which a growing amount of the world's population has become either [[overweight]] or more conscious of weight and the need for a healthy diet in general, the appearance of exceptionally larger burgers (popularly known as "XXL hamburgers") has generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Gard, Michael |author2=Jan Wright |title= The obesity epidemic |edition= 1st |year= 2005 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 0-415-31895-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[Triple Whopper]], which surpasses the one thousand calorie threshold established by the Health Strategy Against Obesity, which is promoted by the health institutes of the Spanish Association of Food and Nutrition Safety (AESAN). AESAN works to prevent the growth of the incidence of [[obesity]] in all people, particularly children. More generally, [[dietitian]]s are beginning to see that the consumption of foods high in [[calorie]]s can cause excessive [[appetite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Prentice, A. M. |author2=S. A. Jebb |date=November 2003 |title= Fast foods, energy density and obesity: a possible mechanistic link |publisher= Obesity Review |volume= 4 |pages= 187–194 |doi= 10.1046/j.1467-789X.2003.00117.x |issue= 4 |journal= Obesity Reviews |pmid= 14649369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this message, many restaurant chains have reduced the calories in their burgers since the beginning of the 20th century. The late 20th century witnessed a lawsuit brought by [[McDonald's]] against two [[environmental activist]]s, [[Helen Steel]] and David Morris, that was colloquially known as ''[[McLibel]]''. McDonald's took action following the publication of a [[pamphlet]] by Steel and Morris that was entitled ''What’s wrong with McDonald’s: Everything they don’t want you to know'', which was subsequently developed into a documentary called ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]''.

===Media===
In 2004, [[Morgan Spurlock]] addressed the obsessive consumption of hamburgers by some Americans by directing and starring in the documentary film ''[[Super Size Me]]''. In the film, he himself eats only [[McDonald's]] food for an entire month and documents how his health changes. That same year saw the premiere of ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', a film in which [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle restaurants]] played a vital part. Two years later, in 2006, the film ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'' presented a fictional representation of the intrigues and machinations of the [[meat industry]] on the border between Mexico and the United States. It is largely based on the 2001 book ''[[Fast Food Nation|Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal]]''.

The '''Iowa Child Welfare Research Station''' attached to the [[University of Iowa]] conducted pioneering research into child development and child psychology during the 20th century.  German-American psychologist [[Kurt Zadek Lewin]] worked there and [[Robert Richardson Sears]] directed the station for much of the 1940s.  Many other eminent psychologists, physiologists, and researchers were associated with the station and its work.

In 1963 the station was renamed the '''Institute of Child Behavior and Development''' due to negative association amongst the public with the phrase "Child Welfare".&lt;ref name="PsychologyAtIowaP042"&gt;{{citation

==History==

The station was founded in 1917.  A leader of the Iowa Congress of Mothers (a chapter of the National Congress of Mothers, which later became the [[Parent-Teacher Association]]) named [[Cora Bussey Hillis]] arranged for the station to be sited at the University of Iowa and procured funding from the state legislature and the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]].&lt;ref name="Elusive"&gt;{{citation

'''Jacob E. Teitelbaum''' (born April 21, 1952) is an American physician and author with special interests in [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]], and [[pain management]].

==Biography==

Teitelbaum was born in Ohio in 1952. His parents, Sabina and David, were [[Holocaust]] survivors who emigrated to the United States after [[World War II]]. He studied medicine at [[Ohio State University]], graduating in 1977. While in medical school, he developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced him to drop out for a year to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Jacob; ''From Fatigued to Fantastic!'', page xviii, Avery Penguin Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has focused his medical career on developing effective treatment protocols for [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and [[fibromyalgia]], and [[pain management]], authoring numerous research papers, articles, and books on these and other topics.

Dr. Teitelbaum travels extensively to educate and support those afflicted with health issues falling within his areas of specialized expertise, frequently participating in interviews&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[David Jay Brown]] {{cite web |url=http://mavericksofthemind.com/dr-jacob-teitelbaum |title=Understanding and Treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome |publisher=Jacob Teitelbaum |year=2004 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Jonathan Bailor https://pages.sanesolution.com/dr-jacob-teitelbaum-from-fatigued-to-fantastic&lt;/ref&gt; and addressing major medical conferences.&lt;ref&gt;ABIHM Presentation, American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuIRDzUDO3o&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to training other physicians, he focuses on public education and media outreach, and has appeared on ''Fox News,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=jacob+teitelbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor Oz Show,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctoroz.com/search?q1=teitelbaum&lt;/ref&gt; CNN,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/health/upwave-weight-sleeping/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; PBS, NPR, ''and'' Good Morning America''. He notes that his key goals are to make effective treatment available for everyone with CFS, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;http://vitality101.com/cfs-fms-checklist&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuit of this goal, and recognizing that many people cannot afford comprehensive treatment, he developed a free patented software tool that uses the S.H.I.N.E. Protocol to evaluate the causes of energy drain associated with these conditions, and tailors a program to each individual's specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energyanalysisprogram.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitelbaum treats people internationally who suffer with CFL and fybromyalgia, and lives with his wife Laurie, an [[NAET]] practitioner,&lt;ref&gt;NAET Hawaii http://naethawaii.com&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii]].

===The S.H.I.N.E. Protocol===

Teitelbaum's published randomized placebo-controlled study showed that 91% of people with CFS and fibromyalgia improved, with an average 90% increase in quality of life, by using an integrated protocol to optimize energy production. This has been called the SHINE Protocol, and combines both pharmaceutical and natural treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;https://secure.endfatigue.com/tools-support/treatment-protocol.html&lt;/ref&gt; The S.H.I.N.E. Protocol optimizes: (S)leep, (H)ormonal function, (I)mmune support, (N)utritional support, and (E)xercise as able.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vitality101.com/shine&lt;/ref&gt;

His treatment protocol has been editorialized in the Journal of the American Academy of Pain Management as "an excellent and powerfully effective part of the standard of practice for treatment of people who suffer from FMS and MPS" ([[Myofascial pain syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Blatman, H.; Editorial: Effective Treatment of Fibromyalgia and Myofascial Pain Syndrome: A Clinician's Perspective; American Journal of Pain Management, 2002; 12:68-9&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also researched [[nutritional supplements]] to help optimize function in those suffering from these illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;Enzymatic Therapy https://www.enzymatictherapy.com/Products/Energy/Dr-Teitelbaums-Energy-Products.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and developed and published the free app ''Cures A-Z'', available for both iPhone&lt;ref&gt;''Cures A-Z'' for iPhone https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cures-a-z/id297648638?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;''Cures A-Z'' for Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cures.naturalcures&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; devices.

===The Teitelbaum Family Foundation===
Dr. Teitelbaum and his wife oversee the ''Jacob Teitelbaum Family Foundation'', a philanthropic nonprofit organization that has funded forward-thinking external projects and studies since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Pro Publica: Journalism in the Public Interest https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/522139345&lt;/ref&gt;  It also supports the ''Heaven on Earth'' project administered by the website ''Heaven Now''.&lt;ref&gt;HeavenNow.org Annual Video Contest http://heaven-now.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA Warning===
On April 18, 2012 the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) sent a warning letter to Teitelbaum advising him to remove medical claims for natural products he carries on his websites because they had not gone through the FDA approval process for medications. The matter was amicably resolved shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/DrTeitelbaum/posts/309833045763072&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the '''list of 599 additives in [[cigarettes]]''' submitted to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] in April 1994.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;&lt;ref name=599list&gt;[https://www.verywell.com/big-tobaccos-list-of-599-cigarette-additives-2824422 599 Ingredients That Can Be Found in Cigarettes].

By Michael Rabinoff, DO, PhD, Nicholas Caskey, PhD, Anthony Rissling, MA, and Candice Park, BS. "the industry has acknowledged using 599 different cigarette additives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/whats-in-a-cigarette.html What's In a Cigarette?] [[American Lung Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; It applies, as documented, only to American manufactured cigarettes intended for distribution within the United States by the listed companies. The five major [[tobacco company|tobacco companies]] that reported the information were:
* [[American Tobacco Company]]
* [[Brown and Williamson]]
* [[Liggett Group, Inc.]]
* [[Altria Group|Philip Morris Inc.]]
* [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]]

One significant issue is that while all these [[chemical compound]]s have been approved as [[food additive|additives to food]], they were not tested by [[combustion|burning]]. Burning changes the properties of chemicals. According to the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]]: "Of the more than 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful, including hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. Among the 250 known harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 69 can cause cancer."&lt;ref name=69cancer&gt;[https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/cessation-fact-sheet Harms of Cigarette Smoking and Health Benefits of Quitting].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17719">'''Malaria prophylaxis''' is the preventive treatment of [[malaria]]. Several [[malaria vaccine]]s are under development.

For pregnant women who are living in malaria endemic areas, routine malaria chemoprevention is recommended. It improves anemia and parasite level in the blood for the pregnant women and the birthweight in their infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeva-Petrova|first1=D|last2=Kayentao|first2=K|last3=ter Kuile|first3=FO|last4=Sinclair|first4=D|last5=Garner|first5=P|title=Drugs for preventing malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas: any drug regimen versus placebo or no treatment.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 October 2014|issue=10|pages=CD000169|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000169.pub3|pmid=25300703|pmc=4498495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
* Risk management
* Bite prevention—clothes that cover as much skin as possible, insect repellent, insecticide-impregnated bed nets and [[indoor residual spraying]]
* Chemoprophylaxis
* Rapid diagnosis and treatment

Recent improvements in malaria prevention strategies have further enhanced its effectiveness in combating areas highly infected with the malaria parasite.  Additional bite prevention measures include mosquito and insect repellents that can be directly applied to skin.  This form of mosquito repellent is slowly replacing [[indoor residual spraying]], which is considered to have high levels of toxicity by WHO (World Health Organization).  Further additions to preventive care are sanctions on blood transfusions.  Once the malaria parasite enters the erythorocytic stage, it can adversely affect blood cells, making it possible to contract the parasite through infected blood.

[[Chloroquine]] may be used where the parasite is still sensitive, however many malaria parasite strains are now resistant.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt;[[Mefloquine]] (''Lariam''), or [[doxycycline]] (available generically), or the combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[proguanil]] hydrochloride (''Malarone'') are frequently recommended.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt;

==Medications ==
In choosing the agent, it is important to weigh the risk of infection against the risks and side effects associated with the medications.&lt;ref name="McMillanFeigin2006"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Julia A. | last1 = McMillan | first2 = Ralph D. | last2 = Feigin | first3 = Catherine | last3 =  DeAngelis | first4 = M. Douglas | last4 = Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Oski's pediatrics: principles &amp; practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbjFQiz8aR0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA1348|accessdate=13 November 2010|date=1 April 2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-3894-1|pages=1348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disruptive prophylaxis===
An experimental approach involves preventing the parasite from binding with red blood cells by blocking [[calcium signalling]] between the parasite and the host cell. Erythrocyte-binding-like proteins (EBLs) and reticulocyte-binding protein homologues (RHs) are both used by specialized P. falciparum [[organelle]]s known as [[rhoptry|rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s to bind with the host cell. Disrupting the binding process can stop the parasite.&lt;ref name=giz1312&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-red-cell-ntu/30146/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao X, Gunalan K, Yap SS, Preiser PR | title = Triggers of key calcium signals during erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | pages = 2862 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24280897 | pmc = 3868333 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monoclonal antibodies]] were used to interrupt calcium signalling between PfRH1 (an RH protein), EBL protein EBA175 and the host cell. This disruption completely stopped the binding process.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

===Suppressive prophylaxis===
[[Chloroquine]], [[proguanil]], [[mefloquine]], and [[doxycycline]] are suppressive prophylactics. This means that they are only effective at killing the malaria parasite once it has entered the erythrocytic stage (blood stage) of its life cycle, and therefore have no effect until the liver stage is complete.  That is why these prophylactics must continue to be taken for four weeks after leaving the area of risk.

Mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil appear to be equally effective at reducing the risk of malaria for short-term travelers and are similar with regard to their risk of serious side effects.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tickell-Painter M, Maayan N, Saunders R, Pace C, Sinclair D | title = Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | pages = CD006491 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29083100 | pmc = 5686653 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006491.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mefloquine is sometimes preferred due to its once a week dose, however mefloquine is not always as well tolerated when compared with atovaquone-proguanil.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt; There is low-quality evidence suggesting that mefloquine and doxycycline are similar with regards to the number of people who discontinue treatments due to minor side effects.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt; People who take mefloquine may be more likely to experience minor side effects such as sleep disturbances, depressed mood, and an increase in abnormal dreams.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt; There is very low quality evidence indicating that doxycyline use may be associated with an increased risk of indigestion, [[Photosensitivity in humans|photosensitivity]], vomiting, and yeast infections, when compared with mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil.&lt;ref name="Tickell-Painter2017" /&gt;

===Causal prophylaxis===
Causal prophylactics target not only the blood stages of malaria, but the initial liver stage as well. This means that the user can stop taking the drug seven days after leaving the area of risk. [[Malarone]] and [[primaquine]] are the only causal prophylactics in current use.

Specific regimens are recommended by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]],&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.who.int/ith/en/ World Health Organization] provides country-specific advice on malaria prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Protection Agency|UK HPA]]&lt;ref&gt;2007 guidelines are available from the [http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/guidelines.htm UK Health Protection Agency] website as a PDF file and includes detailed country-specific information for UK travellers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/malaria-guidance-data-and-analysis|title = Malaria: guidance, data and analysis|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = September 10, 2014|website = |publisher = Public Health England}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]&lt;ref&gt;the [https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website hosts constantly updated country-specific information on malaria.  The advice on this website is less detailed, is very cautious and may not be appropriate for all areas within a given country.  This is the preferred site for travellers from the US.&lt;/ref&gt; for prevention of [[P. falciparum]] infection. HPA and WHO advice are broadly in line with each other (although there are some differences).  CDC guidance frequently contradicts HPA and WHO guidance.

These regimens include:
* [[doxycycline]] 100&amp;nbsp;mg once daily (started one day before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);
* [[mefloquine]] 250&amp;nbsp;mg once weekly (started two-and-a-half weeks before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);
* [[atovaquone/proguanil]] (Malarone) 1 tablet daily (started one day before travel, and continued for 1 week after returning). Can also be used for therapy in some cases.

In areas where chloroquine remains effective:
* [[chloroquine]] 300&amp;nbsp;mg once weekly, and [[proguanil]] 200&amp;nbsp;mg once daily (started one week before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);
* [[hydroxychloroquine]] 400&amp;nbsp;mg once weekly (started one to two weeks before travel and continued for four weeks after returning)

What regimen is appropriate depends on the person who is to take the medication as well as the country or region travelled to.  This information is available from the UK HPA, WHO or CDC (links are given below).  Doses depend also on what is available (e.g., in the US, mefloquine tablets contain 228&amp;nbsp;mg base, but 250&amp;nbsp;mg base in the UK). The data is constantly changing and no general advice is possible.

Doses given are appropriate for adults and children aged 12 and over.

Other chemoprophylactic regimens that have been used on occasion:
* [[Dapsone]] 100&amp;nbsp;mg and [[pyrimethamine]] 12.5&amp;nbsp;mg once weekly (available as a combination tablet called Maloprim or Deltaprim): this combination is not routinely recommended because of the risk of [[agranulocytosis]];
* [[Primaquine]] 30&amp;nbsp;mg once daily (started the day before travel, and continuing for seven days after returning): this regimen is not routinely recommended because of the need for [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase|G-6-PD]] testing prior to starting primaquine (''see the article on'' [[primaquine]] for more information).
* [[Quinine]] sulfate 300 to 325&amp;nbsp;mg once daily: this regimen is effective but not routinely used because of the unpleasant side effects of quinine.

Prophylaxis against ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' requires a different approach given the long liver stage of this parasite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz E, Parise M, Kozarsky P, Cetron M | title = Delayed onset of malaria--implications for chemoprophylaxis in travelers | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 349 | issue = 16 | pages = 1510–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14561793 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa021592 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=14561793&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a highly specialist area.

==Vaccines==
{{Main|Malaria vaccine}}
In November 2012, findings from a Phase III trials of an experimental [[malaria vaccine]] known as [[RTS,S]] reported that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants. The efficacy was about 30% in infants 6 to 12 weeks of age and about 50% in infants 5 to 17 months of age in the first year of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership)), Agnandji ST, Lell B, Fernandes JF, Abossolo BP, Methogo BG, Kabwende AL, Adegnika AA, Mordmüller B, Issifou S, Kremsner PG, Sacarlal J, Aide P, Lanaspa M, Aponte JJ, Machevo S, Acacio S, Bulo H, Sigauque B, Macete E, Alonso P, Abdulla S, Salim N, Minja R, Mpina M, Ahmed S, Ali AM, Mtoro AT, Hamad AS, Mutani P, Tanner M, Tinto H, D'Alessandro U, Sorgho H, Valea I, Bihoun B, Guiraud I, Kaboré B, Sombié O, Guiguemdé RT, Ouédraogo JB, Hamel MJ, Kariuki S, Oneko M, Odero C, Otieno K, Awino N, McMorrow M, Muturi-Kioi V, Laserson KF, Slutsker L, Otieno W, Otieno L, Otsyula N, Gondi S, Otieno A, Owira V, Oguk E, Odongo G, Woods JB, Ogutu B, Njuguna P, Chilengi R, Akoo P, Kerubo C, Maingi C, Lang T, Olotu A, Bejon P, Marsh K, Mwambingu G, Owusu-Agyei S, Asante KP, Osei-Kwakye K, Boahen O, Dosoo D, Asante I, Adjei G, Kwara E, Chandramohan D, Greenwood B, Lusingu J, Gesase S, Malabeja A, Abdul O, Mahende C, Liheluka E, Malle L, Lemnge M, Theander TG, Drakeley C, Ansong D, Agbenyega T, Adjei S, Boateng HO, Rettig T, Bawa J, Sylverken J, Sambian D, Sarfo A, Agyekum A, Martinson F, Hoffman I, Mvalo T, Kamthunzi P, Nkomo R, Tembo T, Tegha G, Tsidya M, Kilembe J, Chawinga C, Ballou WR, Cohen J, Guerra Y, Jongert E, Lapierre D, Leach A, Lievens M, Ofori-Anyinam O, Olivier A, Vekemans J, Carter T, Kaslow D, Leboulleux D, Loucq C, Radford A, Savarese B, Schellenberg D, Sillman M, Vansadia P | display-authors = 6 | title = A phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in African infants | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 24 | pages = 2284–95 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23136909 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1208394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RTS,S vaccine was engineered using a fusion [[HBsAg|hepatitis B surface protein]] containing [[epitope]]s of the outer protein of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria [[sporozite]], which is produced in yeast cells.

==Risk factors==
Most adults from endemic areas have a degree of long-term infection, which tends to recur, and also possess partial [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] (resistance); the resistance reduces with time, and such adults may become susceptible to severe malaria if they have spent a significant amount of time in non-endemic areas. They are strongly recommended to take full precautions if they return to an endemic area.

==History==
Malaria is one of the oldest known pathogens, and began having a major impact on human survival about 10,000 years ago with the birth of agriculture. The development of virulence in the parasite has been demonstrated using genomic mapping of samples from this period, confirming the emergence of genes conferring a reduced risk of developing the malaria infection. References to the disease can be found in manuscripts from [[ancient Egypt]], [[History of India|India]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], illustrating its wide geographical distribution. The first treatment identified is thought to be [[Quinine]], one of four [[alkaloid]]s from the bark of the [[Cinchona]] tree. Originally it was used by the tribes of Ecuador and Peru for treating fevers. Its role in treating malaria was recognised and recorded first by an Augustine monk from [[Lima, Peru]] in 1633. Seven years later the drug had reached Europe and was being used widely with the name 'the Jesuit's bark'. From this point onwards the use of Quinine and the public interest in malaria increased, although the compound was not isolated and identified as the active ingredient until 1820. By the mid-1880s the Dutch had grown vast plantations of cinchona trees and monopolised the world market.

Quinine remained the only available treatment for malaria until the early 1920s. During the [[First World War]] German scientists developed the first synthetic antimalarial compound—[[Atabrin]] and this was followed by [[Resochin]] and [[Sontochin]] derived from [[4-aminoquinoline]] compounds. American troops, on capturing Tunisia during the [[Second World War]], acquired, then altered the drugs to produce [[Chloroquine]].

The development of new [[antimalarial drug]]s spurred the [[World Health Organization]] in 1955 to attempt a [[global malaria eradication program]]. This was successful in much of Brazil, the US and Egypt but ultimately failed elsewhere. Efforts to control malaria are still continuing, with the development of drug-resistant parasites presenting increasingly difficult problems.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] publishes recommendations for travels advising about the risk of contracting malaria in various countries.&lt;ref name="CDCcountry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/malaria-risk-information-and-prophylaxis.aspx |title=Malaria Risk Information and Prophylaxis, by Country | first1 = Kathrine R. | last1 = Tan | first2 = Sonja | last2 = Mali | first3 = Paul M. | last3 = Arguin | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |work=Travelers' Health - Yellow Book |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the factors in deciding whether to use chemotherapy as malaria pre-exposure prophylaxis include the specific itinerary, length of trip, cost of drug, previous adverse reactions to antimalarials, drug allergies, and current medical history.&lt;ref name="CDCcountry"/&gt;

In [[zoology]], '''male lactation''' is the production of milk from a male mammal's [[mammary gland]]s. Such production is known as [[lactation]]. It is well-documented in the [[Dayak fruit bat]]. The term ''male lactation'' is not used in human medicine. It has been used in popular literature, such as Louise Erdrich's ''The Antelope Wife,'' to describe the phenomenon of male [[galactorrhea]], which is a well-documented condition in humans, unrelated to childbirth or nursing. Newborn babies of both sexes can occasionally produce milk; this is called [[neonatal milk]] (also known as "Witch's milk") and not considered male lactation.

==History==
Male lactation was of some interest to [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who reports in ''Voyage aux régions équinoxiales du Nouveau Continent'' of a citizen of the village Arenas (close to [[Cumana]]) who allegedly nurtured his son for three months when his wife was ill,&lt;ref&gt;
Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland ; 1-3. Voyage aux régions équinoxiales du Nouveau Continent : fait en 1799, 1800, 1801, 1803 et 1804. Tome 1 / par Al. de Humboldt et A. Bonpland ; rédigé par Al. de Humboldt; J. Smith (Paris), 1814-1825, p. 376, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61298j/f384.image.r=lozano (Online at gallica)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Charles Darwin]], who commented on it in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871):

{{quote|It is well known that in the males of all mammals, including [hu]man[s], rudimentary mammae exist. These in several instances have become well developed, and have yielded a copious supply of milk. Their essential identity in the two sexes is likewise shown by their occasional sympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter I|Descent of Man, Chapter I]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Darwin later considered the nearly perfect function of male nipples in contrast to greatly reduced structures such as the [[vesicula prostatica]], speculating that both sexes may have nursed young in early mammalian ancestors, and subsequently mammals evolved to inactivate them in males at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter VI|Descent of Man, Chapter VI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and biology==
Male mammals of many species have been observed to lactate under unusual or pathogenic conditions such as extreme stress, castration and exposure to [[phytoestrogens]], or [[pituitary tumor]]s. Therefore, it is hypothesized that, while most male mammals could easily develop the ability to lactate, there is no selective advantage to male lactation. While male mammals could, in theory, improve offspring's survival rate through the additional nourishment provided by lactation, most have developed other strategies to increase the number of surviving offspring, such as mating with additional partners. Presently, very few species are known where male lactation occurs and it is not well understood what evolutionary factors control the development of this trait.&lt;ref name=Kunz_2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kunz | first1 = T | last2 = Hosken | first2 = D | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.09.009 | title = Male lactation: why, why not and is it care? | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–85 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19100649 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman animal male lactation==
The phenomenon of male lactation occurs in some species, notably the [[Dayak fruit bat]] (''[[Dyacopterus spadiceus]]''), and the lactating males may assist in the [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] of their [[infant]]s. In addition, male [[goats]] are known to lactate on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gómez MA, Garcés-Abadías B, Muñoz A, Vásquez F, Serrano J, Bernabé A | title = Structural and Ultrastructural Study of GH, PRL and SMT Cells in Male Goat by Immunocytochemical Methods | journal = Cells Tissues Organs | year = 1999 | volume = 165 | pages = 22–29 | doi = 10.1159/000016670 | pmid = 10460970 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human male lactation==
Human male breastfeeding is possible, but production of the hormone [[prolactin]] is necessary to induce lactation, so male lactation does not occur under normal conditions.&lt;ref name=Swaminathan&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nikhil Swaminathan | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/ | title = Strange but True: Males Can Lactate | journal = [[Scientific American]] | date = September 6, 2007 | access-date = 2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domperidone]] is a drug that can be used to increase lactation. Male lactation has also been seen during recovery from starvation. This may be because glands that produce hormones recover faster than the liver, which absorbs hormones, leading to high hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Father's Milk: From goats to people, males can be mammary mammals, too |first=Jared |last=Diamond |date=February 1, 1995 |publisher=''Discover Magazine'' |access-date=2017-09-06 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/feb/fathersmilk468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spontaneous production of milk not associated with childbirth, known as [[galactorrhea]], can occur in males and females.&lt;ref name=Rohn_1984&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rohn | first1 = R.

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A.

Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking.

Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor (Nelly) Brennan''', (26 January 1792&amp;nbsp;– 23 January 1859) was a Manx [[washerwoman]] who became instrumental in the introduction of the practices of [[nursing]] on the [[Isle of Man]]. She came to prominence during the [[cholera]] outbreaks which affected the Island in 1832 and 1833 in which she nursed those suffering from the disease. This has led to her becoming known as the ''"[[Florence Nightingale]] of the Isle of Man."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tynwald.org.im/education/history/roh/Pages/Patriots/Brennan-Nelly.aspx|title=Tynwald - Parliament of the Isle of Man - Nelly Brennan |website=www.tynwald.org.im}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Eleanor Brennan (always known as Nelly) was born in Douglas, Isle of Man in 1792. Her [[Irish people|Irish]] father was a [[boatswain]] on a [[Man-of-war|man-o-war]] and had been drowned at sea a few months before her birth. Her mother died when she was 16 requiring her to develop self-reliance and diligence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/kf1893/ch04.htm|title=Chap04- Manx Recollections, 1894|website=www.isle-of-man.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:St George's Church.jpg|thumb|St George's Church, Isle of Man.]]

By 1809 she had become a regular attendee of the daily early morning services at [[St George's Church, Isle of Man|St George's Church]] where she met Thomas Howard who was the [[curate]] of the church, leading Nelly to devote her life to God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; In addition she would also regularly attend the [[Wesleyan]] chapel located in what was then called Preaching House Lane (since renamed Wellington Street).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; 

Said to be utterly trustworthy, she earned her living as a [[washerwoman]] being described by a contemporary report as ''"the best [[Mangle (machine)|manglewoman]] in the town."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;  

===Cholera epidemic===
During the years 1832 and 1833 a severe outbreak of [[cholera]] swept the Isle of Man the effects of which were particularly acute in what was by that time the largest town on the Island, Douglas. Nelly Brennan devoted herself to the nursing of those afflicted, making numerous visits to the homes of the sick and dying, and to the temporary cholera hospital; where she would prepare food, clean their clothes and wash bodies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

When the epidemic had passed she undertook responsibility for many children who had been left [[orphan]]ed some of whom were taken into her own home, and numerous testimonies exist regarding her work for the poor people of Douglas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

===Later life===
Although she herself escaped infection her devotion led to her near [[destitution]]. One reason for this was a loss of business she suffered as a consequence of the help she had offered to those affected by the cholera outbreak. This resulted in certain customers refusing to send their clothes to her to be laundered, fearing that they may become infected. Following the cholera outbreak she was employed by the Castle Mona Hotel as a laundress, living in a small apartment near the hotel. However due to the distance between the hotel and the town she was unable to offer the same level of assistance to the poor and consequently she decided to give up her employment and return to aiding the sick. When questioned as to the wisdom of this decision she is said to have replied: 'I dare not neglect the poor.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

Having spent all her own money on the cleaning of the clothes of the sufferers, her outward appearance and the cleanliness of her home masked her personal plight. She was saved by private charity, being presented with a sum of 12 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] of which she would only accept a small amount, donating the majority of the sum to charitable purposes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;
[[File:Nelly Brennan's House.jpg|thumb|The former home of Nelly Brennan, Wesley Terrace, Douglas Isle of Man.]]
The latter part of the 1830s saw the opening of a [[dispensary]] in Douglas situated in what is today Strand Street. In turn a hospital was added and despite  her illiteracy, Nelly Brennan was appointed its first [[matron]].&lt;ref&gt;Isle of Man Examiner, Friday, December 08, 1950; Page: 7&lt;/ref&gt; She was employed with an annual salary of £30 per year in addition to which she received a house with a gas and coal allowance. Due to her devotion to the job she suffered a breakdown after 18 months and was compelled to resign.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

However she still sought to aid the sick and the poor, known throughout the town of Douglas in her efforts to relive distress and hardship. 

In her later years Nelly Brennan achieved her ambition to have a house built for herself, and making a will leaving the house to a young woman whom she had reared as her own and following her death to the [[Wesleyan]] Connexion. She became actively involved in the [[Dorcas|Douglas Dorcas Society]], some of the early meetings of which took place at her home in Wesley Terrace.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

==Death==
Following years of exposure to numerous illnesses, in the latter part of 1858 Nelly Brennan's health started to decline dramatically. Advised to rest, she continued to collect clothes for the poor of Douglas, however she was confined to bed during Christmas week.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; 

Nelly Brennan died at her home on January 23, 1859, three days before her 67th birthday.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

==Funeral==
Nelly Brennan's funeral took place at St George's Church. Seven ministers of different congregations were in attendance in order to pay their respects and of whom they described as:
 
{{Quotation|''"one of the most wonderful women who had ever lived in the Island and one whose devotion to duty was not exceeded even by Florence Nightingale."''}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6153">[[File:Injection Syringe 01.jpg|right|size=200px|thumb|In '''neural therapy''' anaesthetic is injected to try and disrupt a type of electrical energy said to cause illness|alt=A syringe being held upright; the plunger is being depressed and liquid droplets debouching from the needle tip]]'''Neural therapy''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]] in which local anesthetic is injected into certain locations of the body in an attempt to treat chronic pain and illness.&lt;ref name=Diamond2000/&gt;

There is no good evidence that the therapy works and it carries some risk; it has not been found to be of overall benefit.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ernst2007/&gt;

== Description and history ==
Neural therapy has been described as a form of [[holistic medicine]] for treating illness and chronic pain.&lt;ref name=Diamond2000&gt;{{cite book|first=WJ|last=Diamond|title=The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KECumbYp-dkC&amp;pg=PA229|year=2000|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4021-0|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Quackwatch]], neural therapy is "a bizarre approach claimed to treat pain and disease by injecting local anesthetics into nerves, scars, glands, trigger points, and other tissues".&lt;ref name="quack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html|title=Stay Away from "Holistic" and "Biological" Dentists|last=Barrett|first=S |authorlink= Stephen Barrett |date=28 December 2012|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea underlying the therapy is that "interference fields" (''Störfelder'') at certain sites of the body are responsible for a type of electric energy that causes illness.&lt;ref name=Ernst2007/&gt; The fields can be disrupted by injection, allowing the body to heal.&lt;ref name=az&gt;{{cite book|first1=F|last1=Mantle|first2=D|last2=Tiran|work=A-Z of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A guide for health professionals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYvQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT167|year=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=0-7020-4999-9|page=167|title=Neural Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice originated in 1925 when Ferdinand Huneke, a German surgeon, used a newly launched pain drug that contained [[procaine]] (a local [[anaesthetic]]) on his sister who had severe intractable [[migraine]]s. Instead of using it [[intramuscular]]ly as recommended he injected it intravenously and the migraine attack stopped immediately. He and his brother Walter subsequently used [[Novocaine]] in a similar way to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name=Diamond2000/&gt;

In 1940 Ferdinand Huneke injected the painful shoulder of a woman who also had an [[osteomyelitis]] in her leg which at that time (before [[antibiotics]]) threatened her with [[amputation]]. The shoulder pain improved somewhat but the leg wound became itchy. On injecting the leg wound the shoulder pain vanished immediately&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a reaction he called the "phenomenon of seconds" (''Sekundenphänomen'').&lt;ref name=Diamond2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ernst2007/&gt;

==Reception, effectiveness and safety==

Neural therapy is practiced mostly in South America and Europe.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; A 2007 survey of family physicians in Germany found neural therapy to be among the most used of alternative medical techniques.&lt;ref name=Joos&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/ecam/nep019|name-list-format=vanc|title=Integration of Complementary and Alternative Medicine into Family Practices in Germany: Results of a National Survey|year=2011|last1=Joos|first1=Stefanie|last2=Musselmann|first2=Berthold|last3=Szecsenyi|first3=Joachim|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=2011|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quackwatch includes neural therapy on its list of "questionable treatments".&lt;ref name="questionable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/treatmentindex.html|title=Index of Questionable Treatments|date=20 November 2013|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific evidence does not support claims that neural therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite web

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;   
'''Neuroleptic malignant syndrome''' ('''NMS''') is a life-threatening reaction that can occur in response to [[antipsychotic|neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication]].&lt;ref name=Ber2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=BD|title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a review for neurohospitalists.|journal=The Neurohospitalist|date=January 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=41–7|doi=10.1177/1941875210386491|pmid=23983836|pmc=3726098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include [[hyperpyrexia|high fever]], confusion, rigid muscles, variable blood pressure, sweating, and fast heart rate.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; Complications may include [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[high blood potassium]], [[kidney failure]], or [[seizures]].&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=NORD2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome/|website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219085103/https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome/|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Any medications within the family of neuroleptics can cause the condition, though [[typical antipsychotics]] appear to have a higher risk than [[atypical antipsychotics|atypicals]].&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; Onset is often within a few weeks of starting the medication but can occur at any time.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Risk factors include dehydration, [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]], and [[catatonia]].&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt; Rapidly decreasing the use of [[levodopa]] may also trigger the condition.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; The underlying mechanism involves blockage of [[dopamine receptors]].&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; Diagnosis is based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=NORD2004/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Management includes stopping the offending medication, rapid cooling, and starting other medications.&lt;ref name=NORD2004/&gt; Medications used include [[dantrolene]], [[bromocriptine]], and [[diazepam]].&lt;ref name=NORD2004/&gt; The risk of death among those affected is about 10%.&lt;ref name=Str2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strawn JR, Keck PE, Caroff SN |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=870–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17541044 |doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.6.870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people can eventually be restarted on a lower dose of antipsychotic.&lt;ref name=NORD2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Among those in [[psychiatric hospitals]] on neuroleptics about 15 per 100,000 are affected per year.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; Males appear to be more often affected than females.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; In the second half of the 20th century rates were higher than present, at about 2% of people in hospital per year.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt; The condition was first described in 1956.&lt;ref name=Ber2011/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The first symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are usually [[muscle cramp]]s and [[tremor]]s, [[fever]], symptoms of [[autonomic nervous system]] instability such as unstable [[blood pressure]], and sudden changes in mental status (agitation, [[delirium]], or [[coma]]). Once symptoms appear, they may progress rapidly and reach peak intensity in as little as three days. These symptoms can last anywhere from eight hours to forty days.&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt;

Symptoms are sometimes misinterpreted by doctors as symptoms of mental illness which can result in delayed treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Milbouer, "Quest for the truth", ''Nashua Telegraph'' http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050424/NEWS01/104240081 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222612/http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050424%2FNEWS01%2F104240081 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NMS is less likely if a person has previously been stable for a period of time on antipsychotics, especially in situations where the dose has not been changed and there are no issues of noncompliance or consumption of psychoactive substances known to worsen [[psychosis]].

* Increased body temperature &gt;38&amp;nbsp;°C (&gt;100.4&amp;nbsp;°F), or
* Confused or altered consciousness
* [[Diaphoresis|sweating]]
* Rigid muscles
* Autonomic imbalance

==Causes==
NMS is usually caused by antipsychotic drug use, and a wide range of drugs can result in NMS.&lt;ref name=benzer&gt;{{Emedicine|article|816018|Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals using [[butyrophenone]]s (such as [[haloperidol]] and [[droperidol]]) or [[phenothiazine]]s (such as [[promethazine]] and [[chlorpromazine]]) are reported to be at greatest risk. However, various atypical antipsychotics such as [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], [[risperidone]], [[quetiapine]], and [[ziprasidone]] have also been implicated in cases.&lt;ref name="Khaldi 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khaldi S, Kornreich C, Choubani Z, Gourevitch R |title=Antipsychotiques atypiques et syndrome malin des neuroleptiques : brève revue de la littérature |trans-title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and atypical antipsychotics: A brief review |language=French |journal=L'Encéphale |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=618–24 |year=2008 |pmid=19081460 |doi=10.1016/j.encep.2007.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NMS may also occur in people taking [[dopaminergic|dopaminergic drugs]] (such as [[levodopa]]) for Parkinson's disease, most often when the drug dosage is abruptly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keyser DL, Rodnitzky RL |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease after withdrawal or alteration of dopaminergic therapy |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=151 |issue=4 |pages=794–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1672810 |doi=10.1001/archinte.151.4.794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other drugs with anti-dopaminergic activity, such as the [[antiemetic]] [[metoclopramide]], can induce NMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman LS, Weinrauch LA, D'Elia JA |title=Metoclopramide-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=147 |issue=8 |pages=1495–7 |year=1987 |pmid=3632154 |doi=10.1001/archinte.147.8.1495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even drugs without known anti-dopaminergic activity have been associated with NMS; examples include [[amoxapine]]s and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. Also, [[desipramine]], [[dothiepin]], [[phenelzine]], [[tetrabenazine]], and [[reserpine]] have been known to trigger NMS.&lt;ref name=buckley&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley PF, Hutchinson M |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=271–3 |year=1995 |pmid=7897404 |pmc=1073359 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.58.3.271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the molecular level, NMS is caused by a sudden, marked reduction in dopamine activity, either from withdrawal of dopaminergic agents or from blockade of dopamine receptors.

===Risk factors===
One of the clearest risk factors in the development of NMS is the course of drug therapy chosen to treat a condition. Use of high-potency neuroleptics, a rapid increase in the dosage of neuroleptics, and use of long-acting forms of neuroleptics are all known to increase the risk of developing NMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keck PE, Pope HG, Cohen BM, McElroy SL, Nierenberg AA |title=Risk factors for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A case-control study |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=914–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2572206 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1989.01810100056011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been purported that there is a genetic risk factor for NMS, since identical twins have both presented with NMS in one case, and a mother and two of her daughters have presented with NMS in another case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Otani K, Horiuchi M, Kondo T, Kaneko S, Fukushima Y |title=Is the predisposition to neuroleptic malignant syndrome genetically transmitted? |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue= |pages=850–3 |year=1991 |pmid=1678666 |doi=10.1192/bjp.158.6.850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographically, it appears that males, especially those under forty, are at greatest risk for developing NMS, although it is unclear if the increased incidence is a result of greater neuroleptic use in men under forty.&lt;ref name=benzer/&gt; It has also been suggested that postpartum women may be at a greater risk for NMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander PJ, Thomas RM, Das A |title=Is risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome increased in the postpartum period? |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=254–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9632037 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v59n0509a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important risk factor for this condition is [[Lewy body dementia]]. These patients are extremely sensitive to neuroleptics. As a result, neuroleptics should be used cautiously in all cases of dementia.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Pathophysiology==
The mechanism is thought to depend on decreased levels of [[dopamine]] activity due to:
* [[Dopamine receptor]] blockade
* Genetically reduced function of dopamine receptor [[Dopamine receptor D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;ref name=pmid12555236&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mihara K, Kondo T, Suzuki A, Yasui-Furukori N, Ono S, Sano A, Koshiro K, Otani K, Kaneko S |title=Relationship between functional dopamine D2 and D3 receptors gene polymorphisms and neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B |volume=117B |issue=1 |pages=57–60 |year=2003 |pmid=12555236 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.10025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that blockade of D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) receptors induce massive glutamate release, generating catatonia, neurotoxicity and myotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Weller M, Riederer P |title=Glutamate receptor antagonists for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and akinetic hyperthermic parkinsonian crisis |journal=Journal of Neural Transmission. Parkinson's Disease and Dementia Section |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=63–72 |year=1993 |pmid=8105799 |doi=10.1007/bf02252624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chatterjee A |title=Glutamate-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy in neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=123–4 |year=2014 |pmid=24753679 |pmc=3992752 |doi=10.4103/0972-2327.128579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the blockade of diverse serotonin receptors by atypical antipsychotics and activation of 5HT1 receptors by certain of them reduces GABA release and indirectly induces glutamate release, worsening this syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Odagaki Y |title=Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin toxicity associated with atypical antipsychotics? |journal=Current Drug Safety |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=84–93 |year=2009 |pmid=19149529 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/68331/article |doi=10.2174/157488609787354387 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603025922/http://www.eurekaselect.com/68331/article |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscular symptoms are most likely caused by blockade of the [[dopamine receptor D2|dopamine receptor D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], leading to abnormal function of the [[basal ganglia]] similar to that seen in [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name=uptodate.com&gt;http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=medneuro/5946&amp;selectedTitle=1~123&amp;source=search_result#26 {{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the failure of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine receptor antagonism or dopamine receptor dysfunction does not fully explain the presenting symptoms and signs of NMS, as well as the occurrence of NMS with [[atypical antipsychotic]] drugs with lower D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine activity.&lt;ref name=pmid15119907&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ananth J, Parameswaran S, Gunatilake S, Burgoyne K, Sidhom T |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and atypical antipsychotic drugs |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=464–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15119907 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v65n0403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the hypothesis of sympathoadrenal hyperactivity (results from removing tonic inhibition from the [[sympathetic nervous system]]) as a mechanism for NMS.&lt;ref name=pmid9989551&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gurrera RJ |title=Sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and the etiology of neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=169–80 |year=1999 |pmid=9989551 |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.2.169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Release of calcium is increased from the sarcoplasmic reticulum with antipsychotic usage. This can result in increased muscle contractility, which can play a role in the breakdown of muscle, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. Some antipsychotic drugs, such as [[typical antipsychotics|typical neuroleptics]], are known to block dopamine receptors; other studies have shown that when drugs supplying dopamine are withdrawn, symptoms similar to NMS present themselves.&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt;

There is also thought to be considerable overlap between malignant catatonia and NMS in their pathophysiology, the former being idiopathic and the latter being the drug-induced form of the same syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Northoff G |title=Catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome: psychopathology and pathophysiology |journal=Journal of Neural Transmission |volume=109 |issue=12 |pages=1453–67 |year=2002 |pmid=12486486 |doi=10.1007/s00702-002-0762-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Leukocytosis|raised white blood cell count]] and [[creatine phosphokinase]] (CPK) plasma concentration seen in those with NMS is due to increased muscular activity and [[rhabdomyolysis]] (destruction of muscle tissue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Latham J, Campbell D, Nichols W, Mott T |title=How much can exercise raise creatine kinase level—and does it matter? |journal=The Journal of Family Practice |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=545–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18687233 |url=http://www.jfponline.com/home/article/how-much-can-exercise-raise-creatine-kinase-level-and-does-it-matter/86f4f4fd65053888a3d529aca00eb455.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601202531/http://www.jfponline.com/home/article/how-much-can-exercise-raise-creatine-kinase-level-and-does-it-matter/86f4f4fd65053888a3d529aca00eb455.html |archivedate=2016-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient may suffer [[hypertensive crisis]] and [[metabolic acidosis]]. A non-generalized slowing on an [[EEG]] is reported in around 50% of cases.

The fever seen with NMS is believed to be caused by hypothalamic dopamine receptor blockade. The peripheral problems (the high white blood cell and CPK count) are caused by the antipsychotic drugs. They cause an increased calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] of muscle cells which can result in rigidity and eventual cell breakdown. No major studies have reported an explanation for the abnormal [[Electroencephalogram|EEG]], but it is likely also attributable to dopamine blockage leading to changes in neuronal pathways.&lt;ref name=benzer/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Differentiating NMS from other neurological disorders can be very difficult. It requires expert judgement to separate symptoms of NMS from other diseases. Some of the most commonly mistaken diseases are [[encephalitis]], [[toxic encephalopathy]], [[status epilepticus]], [[heat stroke]], and [[malignant hyperthermia]]. Due to the comparative rarity of NMS, it is often overlooked and immediate treatment for the syndrome is delayed. Drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]] may also produce similar symptoms.&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sachdev PS |title=A rating scale for neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=249–56 |year=2005 |pmid=15996751 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2005.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[differential diagnosis]] is similar to that of [[hyperthermia]], and includes [[serotonin syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christensen V, Glenthøj B |title=[Malignant neuroleptic syndrome or serotonergic syndrome] |journal=Ugeskrift for Lægerer |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=301–2 |year=2001 |pmid=11219110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features which distinguish NMS from serotonin syndrome include [[bradykinesia]], muscle rigidity, and a high white blood cell count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birmes P, Coppin D, Schmitt L, Lauque D |title=Serotonin syndrome: a brief review |journal=CMAJ |volume=168 |issue=11 |pages=1439–42 |year=2003 |pmid=12771076 |pmc=155963 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12771076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
NMS is a medical emergency and can lead to death if untreated. The first step is to stop the antipsychotic medication and treat the [[hyperthermia]] aggressively, such as with cooling blankets or ice packs to the axillae and groin. Supportive care in an intensive care unit capable of circulatory and ventilatory support is crucial.  The best pharmacological treatment is still unclear.  [[Dantrolene]] has been used when needed to reduce muscle rigidity, and more recently dopamine pathway medications such as [[bromocriptine]] have shown benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhib-Jalbut S, Hesselbrock R, Mouradian MM, Means ED |title=Bromocriptine treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=69–73 |year=1987 |pmid=3804991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Amantadine]] is another treatment option due to its dopaminergic and anticholinergic effects.
[[Apomorphine]] may be used however its use is supported by little evidence.&lt;ref name=uptodate.com/&gt; [[Benzodiazepine]]s may be used to control [[wikt:agitation|agitation]]. Highly elevated blood [[myoglobin]] levels can result in [[kidney]] damage, therefore aggressive intravenous hydration with diuresis may be required.  When recognized early NMS can be successfully managed; however, up to 10% of cases can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt;

Should a patient subsequently require an antipsychotic, trialing a low dose of a low-potency atypical antipsychotic is recommended.&lt;ref name=Str2007/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The [[prognosis]] is best when identified early and treated aggressively. In these cases NMS is not usually fatal. In previous studies the mortality rates from NMS have ranged from 20%–38%; however, in the last two decades{{when|date=April 2012}}, mortality rates have fallen below 10% due to early recognition and improved management.&lt;ref name=niraj&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahuja |first1=N. |last2=Cole |first2=A. J. |title=Hyperthermia syndromes in psychiatry |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=181–91 |doi=10.1192/apt.bp.107.005090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-introduction to the drug that originally caused NMS to develop may also trigger a recurrence, although in most cases it does not.

[[Amnesia|Memory impairment]] is a consistent feature of recovery from NMS, and usually temporary, though in some cases, may become persistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendhekar DN, Duggal HS |title=Persistent amnesia as a sequel of olanzapine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=552–3 |year=2006 |pmid=17135384 |doi=10.1176/jnp.2006.18.4.552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pooled data suggest the incidence of NMS is between 0.2%–3.23%.&lt;ref name=neuro8&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pelonero AL, Levenson JL, Pandurangi AK |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a review |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=1163–72 |year=1998 |pmid=9735957 |doi=10.1176/ps.49.9.1163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more physician awareness coupled with increased use of atypical anti-psychotics have likely reduced the prevalence of NMS.&lt;ref name=benzer/&gt; Additionally, young males are particularly susceptible and the male:female ratio has been reported to be as high as 2:1.&lt;ref name=benzer/&gt;&lt;ref name=neuro8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hernández JL, Palacios-Araus L, Echevarría S, Herrán A, Campo JF, Riancho JA |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=73 |issue=866 |pages=779–84 |year=1997 |pmid=9497946 |pmc=2431511 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.73.866.779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NMS was known about as early as 1956, shortly after the introduction of the first [[phenothiazine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg JM. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. URL: {{cite web |url=http://www.idiom.com/~drjohn/biblio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016043024/http://www.idiom.com/~drjohn/biblio.html |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |df= }}. Accessed: July 3, 2006.{{self-published inline|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMS was first described in 1960 by French clinicians who had been working on a study involving haloperidol. They characterized the condition that was associated with the side effects of haloperidol "''syndrome malin des neuroleptiques''", which was translated to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.&lt;ref name=buckley/&gt;

==Research==
While the pathophysiology of NMS remains unclear, the two most prevalent theories are:
* Reduced dopamine activity due to receptor blockade
* Sympathodrenal hyperactivity and autonomic dysfunction

In the past, research and clinical studies seemed to corroborate the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor blockade theory in which antipsychotic drugs were thought to significantly reduce dopamine activity by blocking the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors associated with this neurotransmitter. However, recent studies indicate a genetic component to the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velamoor VR |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Recognition, prevention and management |journal=Drug Safety |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=1998 |pmid=9673859 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199819010-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the sympathoadrenal hyperactivity model proposed, it has been hypothesized that a defect in calcium regulatory proteins within the sympathetic neurons may bring about the onset of NMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gurrera RJ |title=Is neuroleptic malignant syndrome a neurogenic form of malignant hyperthermia? |journal=Clinical Neuropharmacology |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=183–93 |year=2002 |pmid=12151905 |doi=10.1097/00002826-200207000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of NMS strengthens its suspected association with [[malignant hyperthermia]] in which NMS may be regarded as a neurogenic form of this condition which itself is linked to defective calcium-related proteins.

The introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs, with lower affinity to the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine receptors, were thought to have reduced the incidence of NMS. However, recent studies suggest that the decrease in mortality may be the result of increased physician awareness and earlier initiation of treatment rather than the action of the drugs themselves.&lt;ref name=pmid15119907/&gt; NMS induced by atypical drugs also resembles "classical" NMS (induced by "typical" antipsychotic drugs), further casting doubt on the overall superiority of these drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasan S, Buckley P |title=Novel antipsychotics and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a review and critique |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=8 |pages=1113–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9699705 |doi=10.1176/ajp.155.8.1113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1410">A '''Nightingale ward''' is a type of [[hospital]] ward, which contains one large room without subdivisions for [[patient]] occupancy.  It may have side rooms for utilities and perhaps one or two side rooms, that can be used for patient occupancy when patient isolation or patient privacy is important.  Nightingale wards contain about 24 to 34 beds usually arranged along the sides of the ward. Modern wards tend to separate patients into bays, each usually containing 4 to 6 beds. Observation of the patients by the nursing staff tends to be easier in a Nightingale ward than in bays. In one study, 75% of patients preferred being nursed in a bay rather than in a Nightingale ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Deborah|title='We should not dismiss the value of Nightingale wards'|url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-managers/we-should-not-dismiss-the-value-of-nightingale-wards/5030393.article|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=Nursing Times|date=28 May 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pattison|first1=HM|last2=Robertson|first2=CE|title=The effect of ward design on the well-being of post-operative patients.|journal=Journal of advanced nursing|date=April 1996|volume=23|issue=4|pages=820-6|pmid=8675902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nightingale ward was named after the pioneer of modern nursing, [[Florence Nightingale]].

The '''Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology''' ('''ONC''') is a staff division of the Office of the Secretary, within the [[Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. ONC leads national health IT efforts, charged as the principal federal entity to coordinate nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health information technology and the electronic exchange of [[health information]].

President [[George W. Bush]] created the position of National Coordinator on April 27, 2004 through {{Executive Order|13335}}.&lt;ref name=EO13335&gt;{{Federal Register|69|24059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC): Executive Summary |website=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=9 November 2004 |url=http://www.os.dhhs.gov/healthit/executivesummary.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929210210/http://www.os.dhhs.gov/healthit/executivesummary.html |archive-date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress later mandated ONC in the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] provisions of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], under the Obama Administration.&lt;ref name=ARRA2009&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|1|pipe=American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
With the passage of the [[HITECH Act]], the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is charged with building an interoperable, private and secure nationwide health information system and supporting the widespread, [[Meaningful Use|meaningful use]] of [[health information technology]].

'''ONC’s mission is looking ahead as it begins its second decade in 2014.
ONC is working to improve these five areas:'''
*Adoption: increase end user adoption of electronic health records and health IT to capture and use the information
*Standards: establish standards so the various technologies can speak to each other
*Incentives: provide the right incentives for the market to drive financial and clinical advances
*Privacy and security: make sure protected (personal) health information remains private and secure
*Governance: provide governance and structure for the exchange of health information

The concerted initiative on interoperability in 2014 seeks to achieve the ability of two or more systems to exchange health information and use the information once it is received.

'''The mission of ONC is to optimize the paths to reach these five health IT goals along with interoperability to support the Triple Aim.''' Widely adopted by the healthcare sector, the Triple Aim was developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to 1) improve patient experience of care, 2) improve the health of populations, and 3) reduce per capita costs of healthcare.
'''
The Federal Health IT Strategic Plan from 2011-2015 had set these five goals'''
*Achieve adoption and information exchange through meaningful use of health IT
*Improve care, improve population health, and reduce healthcare costs through the use of health IT
*Inspire confidence and trust in health IT
*Empower individuals with health IT to improve their health and the health care system
*Achieve rapid learning and technological advancement

'''In its ongoing work, ONC is looking to address these priorities in 2014:'''
*Evolve from ARRA structure of the ONC
*Federal HIT Strategic Plan
*Develop national consensus agenda
*Health information exchange, use and infrastructure a priority focus
*Meaningful use
*Advance health IT tools in support of the Triple Aim

''ONC's mission had previously been described as''
*Promoting development of a nationwide HIT infrastructure that allows for electronic use and exchange of information that:
**Ensures secure and protected patient health information
**Improves health care quality
**Reduces health care costs
**Informs medical decisions at the time/place of care
**Includes meaningful public input in infrastructure development
**Improves coordination of care and information among hospitals, labs, physicians, etc.
**Improves [[public health]] activities and facilitates early identification/rapid response to public health emergencies
**Facilitates health and [[clinical research]]
**Promotes early detection, prevention, and management of [[chronic disease]]s
**Promotes a more effective marketplace
**Improves efforts to reduce health disparities
*Providing leadership in the development, recognition, and implementation of standards and the certification of HIT products;
*Health IT policy coordination;
*Strategic planning for HIT adoption and health information exchange; and
*Establishing governance for the [[Nationwide Health Information Network]].

==Programs==
The [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health]] (HITECH) Act seeks to improve American health care delivery and patient care through an unprecedented investment in health information technology. The provisions of the HITECH Act are specifically designed to work together to provide the necessary assistance and technical support to providers, enable coordination and alignment within and among states, establish connectivity to the public health community in case of emergencies, and assure the workforce is properly trained and equipped to be meaningful users of Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

'''EHR Incentive Program Payments and Meaningful Use'''
The HITECH Act set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs — that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) managed and distributed these federal funds for the meaningful use of electronic health records in conjunction with state Medicaid departments with the cooperation and support of ONC and ONC programs.

As of March 2014, more than $22.5 billion in combined Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made since 2011. More than $14.8 billion in Medicare EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between May 2011 and March 2014. More than $7.7 billion in Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between January 2011 (when the first set of states launched their programs) and March 2014. More than 470,000 eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals are actively registered in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs as of March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/DataAndReports.html |title=Data and Program Reports - Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |website=Cms.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Modern Healthcare, payments have been made to 90.4% of the 5,011 estimated eligible hospitals; and 69.6% of the estimated 527,200 eligible professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2014/4/30/cms-meaningful-use-incentive-payments-reach-229b |title=CMS Meaningful Use Incentive Payments Reach $22.9B |website=iHealthBeat |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ONC Programs'''
The following ONC programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HITECH Programs |website=The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology |date=27 January 2011 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |url=http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/community/healthit_hhs_gov__hitech_programs/1487 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219211316/http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/community/healthit_hhs_gov__hitech_programs/1487 |archive-date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; help to build the foundation for every American to benefit from an electronic health record, as part of a modernized, interconnected, and vastly improved system of care delivery. ''Note: The list of programs below is in the process of being revised and updated.''

*[[Health Information Technology Extension Program]]: A grant program to establish Health Information Technology Regional Extension Centers (RECs) to offer technical assistance, guidance and information on best practices to support and accelerate health care providers’ efforts to become meaningful users of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). While RECs are no longer technically funded by ONC, many of these former grantees have no-cost extensions which allows them to spend whatever is left in their respective grants, as well as find ways to continue their work. The REC program goals were to enroll 100,000 Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in the REC program, help them go "live" on EHRs, and help them demonstrate Meaningful Use. As of January 2014, 136,303 PCPs were enrolled, 123,770 went "live," and 85,106 had demonstrated Meaningful Use. RECs were also encouraged to reach out to all providers, not only PCPs. Among all providers, 149,315 enrolled with RECs, 132,989 went "live" on EHRs, and 89,299 demonstrated Meaningful Use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dashboard.healthit.gov/rec/ |title=Regional Extension Center Program Dashboard from HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT |website=Dashboard.healthit.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONC continues to partner with these former grantees.
*[[State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program]]: A grant program to support States or State Designated Entities (SDEs) in establishing health information exchange (HIE) capability among healthcare providers and hospitals in their jurisdictions. This program was initially envisioned to support query-based health information exchange programs in each state and territory (56 entities in all). The program transitioned into a mixture of query-based and directed exchange programs in order to support the implementation of Meaningful Use. Meaningful Use required healthcare professionals and hospitals to share authorized health information with each other as well as to send receive lab and prescription information with test labs and pharmacies respectively. ONC also issued challenge grants to those participating in the program to encourage breakthrough innovations for health information exchange that could be leveraged widely to support nationwide health information exchange and interoperability. The challenge grants sought to develop innovative and scalable solutions in five key areas: 1) achieving health goals through health information exchange, 2) improving long-term and post-acute care transitions, 3) consumer-mediated information exchange, 4) enabling enhanced query for patient care, and 5) fostering distributed population-level analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/program-initiatives |title=Program Initiatives &amp;#124; Policy Researchers &amp; Implementers |website=HealthIT.gov |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Quarter 3 of 2013, 44 states/territories had directed exchange broadly available, with another 6 reporting regional or piloted programs. As of Quarter 3 of 2013, 32 states/territories had operational query-based exchange broadly available statewide through single or multiple services/entities, 8 had query-based exchange broadly available in regions but not statewide, and 16 did not have operational query-based exchange options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/state-hie-implementation-status |title=State HIE Implementation Status &amp;#124; Policy Researchers &amp; Implementers |website=HealthIT.gov |date=2014-11-30 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONC is continuing to partner with these state entities.
*[[Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program]]: A grant program to fund research focused on achieving breakthrough advances to address well-documented problems that have impeded adoption:
**Security of Health Information Technology
**Patient-Centered Cognitive Support
**Healthcare Application and Network Platform Architectures
**Secondary Use of EHR Data
*[[Beacon Community Program]]: A grant program for communities to build and strengthen their health information technology (health IT) infrastructure and exchange capabilities. These communities will demonstrate the vision of a future where hospitals, clinicians, and patients are meaningful users of health IT, and together the community achieves measurable improvements in health care quality, safety, efficiency, and population health. According to a March 2013 Evaluation, "The Beacon Communities have implemented a wide variety of interventions, including innovations in care delivery, provider feedback and performance measurement initiatives, health IT development projects, and tools to improve the process of care for providers and consumers. Each Beacon Community has tailored its activities to reflect its unique resources, goals, and populations, resulting in a broad range of activities. In many cases, the Communities have chosen to focus all or some of their efforts on specific disease categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/norc_beaconevalcharacterizingcommunities_march_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=EVALUATION OF THE BEACON COMMUNITY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROGRAM |date=March 2013 |website=Healthit.gov |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Beacon programs are no longer technically funded by ONC, many of these former grantees have no-cost extensions which allows them to spend whatever is left in their respective grants, as well as find ways to continue their work. ONC continues to partner with these former grantees.
*Health IT Workforce Training Programs
*[[Community College Consortia to Educate Health Information Technology Professionals Program]]: A grant program that seeks to rapidly create health IT education and training programs at Community Colleges or expand existing programs.  Community Colleges funded under this initiative will establish intensive, non-degree training programs that can be completed in six months or less. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program.
*[[Program of Assistance for University-Based Training]]: A grant program to rapidly increase the availability of individuals qualified to serve in specific health information technology professional roles requiring university-level training. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program.

''*Combined Results of Community College and University-Based Training:'' In total the two programs trained 21,437 students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands at 91 academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Students-Trained-for-Health-IT-Employment.html |format=PDF |title=HITECH Workforce Development Programs |date=2013 |website=Dashboard.healthit.gov |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/workforceevaluationsummativereport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Final Report : Evaluation of the Information Technology Professionals in Health Care ("Workforce") Program - Summative Report |date=March 2014 |website=Healthit.gov |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Curriculum Development Centers Program]]: A grant program to provide $10 million in grants to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) to support health information technology (health IT) curriculum development. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program.
*[[Competency Examination for Individuals Completing Non-Degree Training Program]]: A grant program to provide $6 million in grants to an institution of higher education (or consortia thereof) to support the development and initial administration of a set of health IT competency examinations. This is one component of the Health IT Workforce Program.

==Advisory committees==
ONC also created two Federal Advisory Committees (FACAs), the Health IT Policy Committee, which the National Coordinator chairs, and the Health IT Standards Committee.

'''Health IT Policy Committee'''
The Health IT Policy Committee recommends a policy framework for the development and adoption of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that permits the electronic exchange and use of health information. Vice-chair of this committee is Paul Tang, MD, MS, who is Vice President, Chief Innovation and Technology Officer at [[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=David |last1=Kibbe |first2=Brian |last2=Klepper |url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2012/02/02/trusting-government-a-tale-of-two-federal-advisory-groups/ |website=Health Affairs Blog |title=Trusting Government: A Tale Of Two Federal Advisory Groups |date=2 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health IT Standards Committee'''
The Health IT Standards Committee recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. The Standards Committee also harmonizes, pilot tests, and ensures consistency with the Social Security Act. Vice-chair of this committee is [[John Halamka]], MD, MS, who is Chief Information Officer of [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], Professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], and a practicing Emergency Physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-april-hitl-standards-committee.html |first=John |last=Halamka |title=The April HIT Standards Committee meeting  |website=Life as a Healthcare CIO |date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Optometry]]''' is a relatively new field in eye care in '''[[Ghana]]'''.

==History==
Optometry is a new field in the eye care system of Ghana.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The '''Eye Secretariat of Ghana''' is the Ghana Ministry of Health agency concerned with eye care in the country. Ghana's first optometrist, [[Kofivi Monny]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.medicbd.com/wiki/Optometry,_KNUST,_Ghana |title=Optometry, KNUST, Ghana - Encyclopedia - MedicBD Health Portal |publisher=Health.medicbd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded{{By whom|date=June 2015}} as a key contributor to the development of optometry there. Monny was trained in [[Nigeria]], and returned to practice optometry after his training. He was the main brain behind the set-up of the [[Department of Optometry]] in [[University of Cape Coast]] to offer the [[Doctor of Optometry]] program and was also a senior lecturer in the department. He also served as a lecturer in [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|KNUST]] when the program began.

The first optometry school in Ghana started in the KNUST Department of Physics in 1992.&lt;ref name="knust.edu.gh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knust.edu.gh/pages/index.php?siteid=optometry |title=Department of Optometry and Visual Science, College of Science, KNUST |publisher=Knust.edu.gh |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first class had just five students and was instructed by Monny. It initially offered only postgraduate degrees, but soon also offered bachelor's degrees. In 2004, just as the first batch of optometrists with the bachelor's degrees had graduated, they were enrolled for the two-year Doctor of Optometry (O.D) program. In 2002, the [[University of Cape Coast]] also began a Doctor of Optometry program.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Training==
Over eighty percent of Ghanaian optometrists receive their training from the KNUST. In 2011, fifty-three and about sixteen students entered KNUST and UCC department of Optometry, respectively. [[Angela O. Amedo]], one of the first optometrists in Ghana, is the Head of Department for Optometry at KNUST. There are about 200 optometrists in Ghana.&lt;ref name="knust.edu.gh"/&gt;

==Newly qualified optometrists==
The newly graduated optometrists are inducted into the Ghana Optometric Association so they can do their one-year internship at any of the Ministry of Health Hospitals or accredited eye clinics throughout the country. After their internship, they are required to write their qualifying exam which upon passing will allow the optometrist to practice without supervision. For a place to qualify to house new optometrists during their internship, there should be an optometrist or ophthalmologist working at the facility. Some of the places where new optometrists work in Ghana are:
* the 37 [[Military Hospital]]
* the Eastern Regional Hospital [[Koforidua]]
* the SAEMA District Hospital, [[Takoradi]]
* the Tamale Teaching Hospital [[Tamale]]
* the Central Regional Hospital, [[Cape Coast]]
* the Our Lady of Grace Hospital, [[Breman Asikuma]]
* the Bishop Ackon Memorial Eye Hospital (Christian Eye Clinic), [[Cape Coast]]
* the Volta Regional Hospital, [[Ho, Ghana|Ho]]
* the Margret Marquart Hospital, [[Kpandu]]
* the Brong Ahafo Regional Hospital [[Sunyani]]
* the Ridge Hospital, [[Accra]]
* the Tema General Hospital
* the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, [[Kumasi]]
* the Upper East Regional Hospital, [[Bolga]]
* the Upper West Regional Hospital, [[Wa, Ghana|Wa]]
* the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, [[Accra]]
* the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, Agogo Asante Akyem

==Ghana Optometric Association==
The Ghana Optometric Association (GOA) is the country's governing body for the optometry profession. Since 2009 all optometrists wanting to be members have had to write a professional exam. Passing this exam gives the optometrist the certification to practice in Ghana. As of March 2010, GOA had 139 members.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=179356 |title=Government to regulate optometry practice &amp;#124; General News 2010-03-28 |publisher=Ghanaweb.com |date=2010-03-28 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today{{When|date=March 2011}} the group has about 200 members. In 2010 the body and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology's Faculty of Distance Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/90811/1/knust-inaugurates-faculty-of-distance-learning.html |title=KNUST Inaugurates Faculty of Distance Learning - modernghana.com/regional news |accessdate=2009-10-30 |publisher=Modern Ghana Media Communication Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; rolled out a two-year programme to offer all members of GOA who did not have the Doctor of Optometry degree to enroll for it. The aim of the programme is to ensure that by the end of 2012 all optometrists in Ghana will have the O.D degree as is required under the Ministry of Health.

===Executives===
It is headed by DSP/Dr. Remi Ninkpe as President of GOA. Dr. Paa Kwesi Fynn Hope is the Secretary.

===Activities===
The GOA has done a lot since its inception. Apart from regulating the activities of optometrists countrywide, it also looks out for the well being of its members in ways such as:
* Organizing continuing education programmes for optometrists
* Advocating for better terms of service from the Ministry of Health
* Partnering international bodies to promote eye care in Ghana

One of the major achievements of GOA was hosting the World Council of Optometry (WCO) General Delegates meeting in Accra from 6 to 10 April 2005. It was the first time the meeting was held in Africa.

The Ghana Optometric Association did so in collaboration with the Africa Council of Optometry with sponsorship from Essilor International. It was attended by about 200 delegates from the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/74742/1/ghana-to-host-world-optometry-meeting.html |title=Ghana To Host World Optometry Meeting |publisher=ModernGhana.com |date=2005-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry of Health and Optometrists==
The Ministry of Health through its hospitals and health facilities is the main provider of eye care services in the country. Over the years it has taken various initiates to train Optometrist through the various Universities. It is its aim to ensure that there is at least one functioning eye unit in every district of the country. So far the number of facilities is woefully inadequate to serve the needs of those who need such services. The MOH is still doing its best to lift the practice of Optometry in Ghana. At the 2010 induction ceremony for new Optometrist it promised to help regulate the activities of Optometrist more &lt;ref name="ghanaweb.com"/&gt; The situation would have been far worse if the various eye care facilities of the [[Christian Health Association of Ghana]] (CHAG) were not functioning. Thirty-five percent of Ghana's health service provision is done by CHAG. As and when new district eye centre are created, an Optometrist is posted there to attend to the district's eye care needs. It must be stated that to date, the MOH is the biggest employer of Optometrist in the country and the MOH deems with all seriousness the role they play in helping the save the sight of Ghanaians.

==Challenges==
Lack of eye care facilities as well as funds has greatly limited the work of optometrists in the country. These constraints force the Ghanaian optometrist to work really hard in order to satisfy the needs of his patients. However, because of the training received most optometrists are able to function once the basic instruments are available. Again, the lack of personnel has led to the rise in quacks who parade as eye doctors and treat all manner of eye conditions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This practice is currently going on and is a major problem in eye care delivery in the country. The continual use of herbal preparations by the populace is also worrisome, since many of these preparations have not been certified for use on the eye.

==Service delivery==
As the average Ghanaian becomes more enlightened concerning the eye and its conditions, optometrists would be required to do more too for their patients. The major concerns that eye patients raise are:
* the long wait periods for them to see the eye doctor. One the average it take about two hours for patients to access eye care services in most MOH hospitals and clinics.
* poor patient education practise from doctor to the patient

With respect to the above, most optometrists the world over are adapting [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] to help the patient better. With respect to the long wait hours, various [[electronic medical record]]s (EMRs) are being used. These do away with paper and manual recording of patient data. As such the patient does not need to wait for his or her records before seeing the doctor. EMRs the world over have been shown to reduce doctor-patient interactions by up to three times. Ghanaian optometrists are now turning to the use of EMRs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Computer |first=Temple |url=http://templecos.blogspot.com/2011/03/ghanaian-optometrist-turn-to-emrs.html |title=Temple Computer Systems: Ghanaian Optometrist turn to EMRs |publisher=Templecos.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve their daily work. Those who are using these EMRs bear witness to this and are continually advocating for the use of EMRs among their colleagues. One of the EMRs in use in Ghana is the Personal Digital Assistant for Eye Clinics (PDAEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Computer |first=Temple |url=http://templecos.blogspot.com/2011/03/optometrist-and-pdaec.html |title=Temple Computer Systems: The Optometrist and PDAEC |publisher=Templecos.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning patient education, various ICT tools are also being used. They include:
* [[Television]]-based educational tools that play (with vocal renditions in the most widely spoken language within the location of the clinic) while patients wait their turn in the waiting area.
* Computer-assisted patient educational tools, that serve as a one-on-one tool for the optometrist during his or her patient education.

==Optometry bill==
There is no law regulating the practice of optometry in Ghana. Around 20% of people claiming to be optometrists in Ghana either do not have training in the field or "go beyond their scope of operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/30714/1/over-20-of-optometrists-are-quack-eye-specialists.html |title=Over 20 of optometrists are quack - Eye specialists |publisher=ModernGhana.com |date=2003-02-02 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A draft optometry bill has been presented to the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], but is yet to be passed. The bill would give the Ghana Optometric Association the authority to regulate the practice of optometry in Ghana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">'''Paul Bucy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|j|uː|s|i}}; November 13, 1904 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1992) was an American [[neurosurgeon]] and [[neuropathologist]] who was a native of [[Hubbard, Iowa]]. He is known both for his part in describing the [[Klüver–Bucy syndrome]], his academic life as a teacher in the neurosciences, and for his founding in 1972 and editing ''Surgical Neurology'' – An International Journal of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience" from 1972 to 1987.

==Academic Life==

Bucy grew up and was educated in [[Iowa]]. He received his bachelor`s degree, a master`s in [[neuropathology]] and his doctorate from the [[University of Iowa]]. He interned and trained at Ford Hospital in Detroit. He was an assistant to [[neurosurgeon]] [[Percival Bailey]] (1892–1973) at the [[University of Chicago]]. In the early 1930s he traveled to Europe, and studied with [[Gordon Morgan Holmes]] (1876–1965) in [[London]] and [[Otfrid Foerster]] (1874–1941) in [[Breslau]]. In 1941, he became Professor of Neurology and Neurological Surgery at the [[University of Illinois]] in Chicago, where he spent 13 years. During [[World War II]] he was a medical consultant to the U.S. Army.

From 1954 to 1972, he was Professor of [[Neurosurgery]] and taught neurosurgical residents at [[Northwestern University]] and at Chicago Memorial Hospital. During his long career, Bucy wrote more than 400 papers and books on neurological and neurosurgical subjects. He trained 65 neurosurgeons who went on to practicing neurosurgery worldwide. Bucy served as publisher for 13 years on the Journal of Neurosurgery. In 1972. after moving to [[Tryon, North Carolina]], he was appointed Clinical Professor of Neurology and Neurological surgery at [[Wake Forest University School of Medicine|Bowman Gray School of Medicine]] in [[Winston-Salem]]. That same year (1972) Bucy became Founding Editor of Surgical Neurology, a new neurosurgical journal, which he edited until 1987 along with [[Robert J. White]].&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenan|first=Heise|title=Dr. Paul C.

Obituary, September 24, 1992|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was past president of the American Neurological Association, [[The Society of Neurological Surgeons]] and The [[World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies]].&lt;ref name=Society /&gt; Bucy died in 1993 at his home in Tryon, where he had lived with his wife Evelyn, who died a year later in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=Society&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14995">'''Pharmaceutical policy''' is a branch of [[health policy]] that deals with the development, provision and use of medications within a health care system. It embraces drugs (both brand name and generic), biologics (products derived from living sources, as opposed to chemical compositions), vaccines and natural health products. Pharmaceutical policy includes:

==Funding of Research in the Life Sciences==
In many countries, an agency of the national government (in the U.S. the NIH, in the U.K. the MRC, and in India the DST) funds university researchers to study the causes of disease, which in some cases leads to the development of discoveries which can be transferred to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies as a basis for drug development.   By setting its budget, its research priorities and making decisions about which researchers to fund, there can be a significant impact on the rate of new drug development and on the disease areas in which new drugs are developed.  For example, a major investment by the NIH into research on HIV in the 1980s certainly could be viewed as an important foundation for the many antiviral drugs that have subsequently been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal, Rashmi, Kaur, Rajinder, Patent Law and Intellectual Property in the Medical Field. IGI Global, Jun 30, 2017 p67-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent Law==
While patent laws are written to apply to all inventions, whether mechanical, pharmaceutical, or electronic, the interpretations of patent law made by government patent granting agencies (the United States Patent and Trademark Office, for example) and courts, can be very subject-matter specific with significant impact on the incentives for drug development and the availability of lower-priced generic drugs.  For example, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Pfizer v. Apotex, 480 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir.2007), held invalid a patent on the “pharmaceutical salt” formulation of a previously patented active ingredient.  If that decision is not overturned by the United States Supreme Court, generic versions of the drug in controversy, Norvasc (amlodipine besylate) will be available much earlier.  If the reasoning of the Federal Circuit in the case is applied more generally to other patents on pharmaceutical formulations, it would have a significant impact in speeding generic drug availability (and, conversely, some negative impact on the incentives and funding for the research and development of new drugs).&lt;ref&gt;Janice M. Mueller. Mueller on Patent Law: Patentability and Validity. Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
This involves the approval of a product for sale in a jurisdiction. Typically a national agency such as the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (specifically, the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]], or CDER), the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] or [[Health Canada]] or Ukrainian Drug Registration Agency [https://web.archive.org/web/20031220125726/http://www.drugmed.gov.ua/] is responsible for reviewing a product and approving it for sale. The regulatory process typically focuses on quality, safety and efficacy. To be approved for sale a product must demonstrate that it is generally safe (or has a favourable risk/benefit profile relative to the condition it is intended to treat), that it does what the manufacturer claims and that it is produced to high standards. Internal staff and expert advisory committees review products. Once approved, a product is given an approval letter or issued with a notice of compliance, indicating that it may now be sold in the jurisdiction. In some cases, such approvals may have conditions attached, requiring, for example additional ‘post-marketing’ trials to clarify an issue (such as efficacy in certain patient populations or interactions with other products) or criteria limiting the product to certain uses.

== Pricing ==
In many jurisdictions drug prices are regulated. For example, in the UK the [[Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme]] is intended to ensure that the National Health Service is able to purchase drugs at “reasonable prices.” In Canada, the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]] examines drug pricing, compares the proposed Canadian price to that of seven other countries and determines if a price is “excessive” or not. In these circumstances, drug manufacturers must submit a proposed price to the appropriate regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Emily. Law and the regulation of medicines. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012. p161-170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reimbursement ==
Once a regulatory agency has determined the clinical benefit and safety of a product and pricing has been confirmed (if necessary), a drug manufacturer will typically submit it for evaluation by a payer of some sort. Payers may be private insurance plans, governments (through the provision of benefits plans to insured populations or specialized entities like [[Cancer Care Ontario]], which funds in-hospital oncology drugs) or health care organizations such as hospitals. At this point the critical issue is cost-effectiveness. This is where the discipline of [[Pharmacoeconomics|pharmaco-economics]] is often applied. This is a specialized field of health economics that looks at the cost/benefit of a product in terms of quality of life, alternative treatments (drug and non-drug) and cost reduction or avoidance in other parts of the health care system (for example, a drug may reduce the need for a surgical intervention, thereby saving money). Structures like the UK’s [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] and Canada’s [[Common Drug Review]] evaluate products in this way. Some jurisdictions do not, however, evaluate products for cost-effectiveness. In some instances, individual drug benefit plans (or their administrators) may also evaluate products. Additionally, hospitals may have their own review committees (often called a [[Pharmacy and Therapeutics]] (P&amp;T) committee) to make decisions about which drugs to fund from the hospital budget.

Drug plan administrators may also apply their own pricing rules outside of that set by national pricing agencies. For example, British Columbia uses a pricing model called [[reference-based pricing]] to set the price of drugs in certain classes. Many US [[pharmacy benefit managers]] (PBMs) use strategies like tiered formularies and preferred listings to encourage competition and downward pricing pressure, resulting in lower prices for benefits plans. Competitive procurement of this sort is common among large purchasers such as the US [[Veteran’s Health Administration]].

Typically, a manufacturer will provide an estimate of the projected use of a drug as well as the expected fiscal impact on a drug plan’s budget. If necessary, a drug plan may negotiate a risk-sharing agreement to mitigate the potential for an unexpectedly large budget impact due to incorrect assumptions and projections.

Because the clinical trials used to generate information to support drug licensing are limited in scope and duration, drug plans may request ongoing post-market trials (often called Phase IV or pragmatic clinical trials) to demonstrate a product’s ‘real world safety and effectiveness.’ These may take the form of a patient registry or other means of data collection and analysis.

Once a product is deemed cost-effective, a price negotiated (or applied in the case of a pricing model) and any risk-sharing agreement negotiated, the drug is placed on a drug list or formulary. Prescribers may choose drugs on the list for their patients, subject to any conditions or patient criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Vogenberg, F. Randy, ed. Understanding Pharmacy Reimbursement. Ashp, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formulary management ==
At the core of most reimbursement regimes is the drug list, or formulary. Managing this list can involve many different approaches. Negative lists – products that are not reimbursed under any circumstances are used in some jurisdictions (c.f. Germany). More dynamic formularies may have graduated listings such as Ontario’s recent conditional listing model. As mentioned, formularies may be used to drive choice to lower cost drugs by structuring a sliding scale of co-payments favouring cheaper products or those for which there is a preferential agreement with the manufacturer. This is the principle underlying preferred drug lists used in many US state Medicaid programs. Some jurisdictions and plans (such as Italy) may also categorize drugs according to their ‘essentialness’ and determine the level of reimbursement the plan will provide and the portion that the patient is expected to pay.

Formularies may also segment drugs into categories for which a prior authorization is needed. This is usually done to limit the use of a high cost drug or one that has potential for inappropriate use (sometimes called ‘off-label’ as it involves using a product to treat conditions other than those for which its license was granted). In this circumstance a health care provider would have to seek permission to prescribe the product or the pharmacist would have to obtain permission prior to dispensing it.&lt;ref&gt;Angus, Douglas E., and Heather M. Karpetz. "Pharmaceutical policies in Canada." Pharmacoeconomics 14, no. 1 (1998): 81-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
Depending on the structure of the health care system, drugs may be purchased by patients themselves, a health care organization on behalf of patients or an insurance plan (public or private). Hospitals typically limit eligibility to their in-patients. Private plans may be employer-sponsored such as [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]], mandated by legislation, as in Quebec or consist of an outsourcing arrangement for a public plan, such as the US [[Medicare Part D]] scheme. Public plans may be structured in a variety of ways including:

1.	Universal, as in Australia’s [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]]&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Restricted by age, as in the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan for seniors&lt;br /&gt;
3.	Segmented by disease group, such as Manitoba’s cystic fibrosis drug plan&lt;br /&gt;
4.	Geared to income, such as US [[Medicaid]] programs in many states

Additionally, plans may be structured to respond to the ‘catastrophic’ impact of drug expenses incurred by those with serious diseases or high drug spending relative to income. These patient populations, often called ‘medically needy,’ may have all or part of their drug costs covered by ‘plans of last resort,’ (typically government-sponsored). One such plan is Ontario’s Trillium Drug Program.

Pharmaceutical policy may also be used to respond to health crises. For example, Argentina launched [[REMEDIAR]] during its financial crisis of 2002. The government-sponsored program provides a specified list of essential drugs to primary care clinics in low-income neighbourhoods. Similarly, Brazil provides drugs for HIV/AIDS free to all citizens as a deliberate public health policy choice.

Eligibility policy also focuses on cost-sharing between a plan and the beneficiary (the insured person). Co-payments may be used to drive certain prescribing choices (for example, favouring generic over brand drugs or preferred over non-preferred products). Deductibles may be used as part of geared to income plans.&lt;ref&gt;Angus, Douglas E., and Heather M. Karpetz. "Pharmaceutical policies in Canada." Pharmacoeconomics 14, no. 1 (1998): 81-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prescribing ==
Pharmaceutical policy may also attempt to shape and inform prescribing. Prescribing may be limited to physicians or include certain classes of health care providers such as nurse practitioners and pharmacists. There may be limitations placed on each class of provider. This may take the form of prescribing criteria for a drug, limiting its prescribing to a particular type of specialist physician for example (such as HIV/AIDS drugs to physicians with advanced training in this area), or it may involve special drug lists that a specific type of health care provider (such as a nurse practitioner) may prescribe from.&lt;ref&gt;Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p219&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans may also seek to influence prescribing by providing information to prescribers. This practice is often called ‘[[academic detailing]]’ to differentiate it from the detailing (provision of drug information) done by pharmaceutical companies. Organizations such as Australia’s [[National Prescribing Service]] typify this technique, providing independent information, including head-to-head comparisons and cost-effectiveness information to prescribers to influence their choices.&lt;ref&gt;Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p27, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, efforts to promote the ‘appropriate use’ of medications may also involve other providers like pharmacists providing clinical consulting services. In settings such as hospitals and long-term care, pharmacists often collaborate closely with physicians to ensure optimal prescribing choices are made. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, pharmacists are compensated for providing medication reviews for patients outside of acute or long-term care settings. Pharmacist collaboration with family physicians in order to improve prescribing may also be funded.&lt;ref&gt;Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p27-30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pharmacy services ==
Pharmaceutical policy may also encompass how drugs are provided to beneficiaries. This includes the mechanics of drug distribution and dispensing as well as the funding of such services. For example, some HMOs in the US use a ‘central fill’ approach where all prescriptions are packaged and shipped from a central location instead of at a community pharmacy. In other jurisdictions, retail pharmacies are compensated for dispensing drugs to eligible beneficiaries. A state-operated approach may also be taken, as with Sweden’s [[Apoteket]], which had the monopoly on retail pharmacy until 2009, and was not-for-profit. Pharmaceutical policy may also subsidize smaller, more marginal pharmacies, using the rationale that they are needed health care providers. The UK’s [[Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme]] works this way.&lt;ref&gt;Aspalter, Christian, Yasuo Uchida, and Robin Gauld, eds. Health Care Systems in Europe and Asia. Routledge, 2012. p29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[philosophy]] of [[healthcare]]''' is the study of the [[ethics]], processes, and people which constitute the maintenance of health for human beings. (Although [[veterinary]] concerns are worthy to note, the body of thought regarding their methodologies and practices is not addressed in this article.) For the most part, however, the philosophy of healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare can be seen as a necessary [[phenomenon]] of human [[civilization]] whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/putting-health-in-perspective Yuval Levin, "Putting Health in Perspective," ''The New Atlantis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of healthcare is primarily concerned with the following elemental questions:

*Who requires and/or deserves healthcare? Is healthcare a fundamental right of all people?
*What should be the basis for calculating the cost of treatments, hospital stays, drugs, etc.?
*How can healthcare best be administered to the greatest number of people?
*What are the necessary parameters for [[clinical trials]] and [[quality assurance]]?
*Who, if anybody, can decide when a patient is in need of "comfort measures" (allowing a natural death by providing medications to treat symptoms related to the patient's illness)?

However, the most important question of all is 'what is health?'. Unless this question is addressed any debate about healthcare will be vague and unbounded. For example, what exactly is a health care intervention? What differentiates healthcare from engineering or teaching, for example? Is health care about 'creating autonomy' or acting in people's best interests? Or is it always both? A 'philosophy' of anything requires baseline philosophical questions, as asked, for example, by philosopher [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvGXLF3uxd0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+seedhouse+health+the+foundations+for+achievement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2lwAOsSnz&amp;sig=m1x991yrTldDBtju1BzbZIKTQUU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3y-mTMycK5TEsAPHsMT-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false David Seedhouse].

Ultimately, the purpose, objective and meaning of healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding the ever-changing fields of [[biotechnology]], medicine, and [[nursing]]. And seeing that healthcare typically ranks as one of the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[allied health professional]]s, hospital administrators, [[health insurance]] companies ([[HMO]]s and [[Preferred provider organization|PPO]]s), the government ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]), and lastly, the patients themselves.

==Ethics of healthcare==
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|[[Hippocrates]], the ancient Greek physician, considered the father of [[Western medicine]].]]

The ethical and/or moral premises of healthcare are complex and intricate. To consolidate such a large segment of [[moral philosophy]], it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, it can be said that healthcare itself is a "''special''" institution within society.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, healthcare ought to "be treated differently from other social goods" in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, "Healthcare Needs and Distributive Justice," 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a [[coma]], then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that "elsewhere" has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.

===Medical ethics===
{{Further|Medical ethics}}
Whereas [[bioethics]] tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of [[Hippocrates]], and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund D. Pellegrino, "The Philosophy of Medicine Reborn" (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds "the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brock, "Quality of Life Measures in Health Care and Medical Ethics," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Terms like [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Therefore, it becomes important to acquire a basic grasp of the varying dynamics that go into a doctor-patient relationship.

===Nursing ethics===
{{Further|Nursing ethics}}
Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, "nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning," whereby it is "the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Janie Butts and Karen Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) endorses an ethical code that emphasizes "values" and "evaluative judgments" in all areas of the nursing profession.&lt;ref&gt;Butts and Rich, "Moral and Ethical Dimensions in Professional Nursing Practice," 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = M |last2 = Heath | first2 = I |last3 = Howick | first3 = J |last4 = Greenhalgh | first4 = T | title = The importance of values in evidence-based medicine | doi = 10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 16 | issue = 69 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fulford | first1 = KWM |last2 = Peile | first2 = H |last3 = Carroll | first3 = H | title = Essential Values-Based Practice | isbn = 9780521530255 | url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/medicine/medicine-general-interest/essential-values-based-practice-clinical-stories-linking-science-people }}&lt;/ref&gt; And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision.

===Business ethics===
{{Further|Health economics}}
Balancing the cost of care with the quality of care is a major issue in healthcare philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments play a major role in determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health insurance corporations as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," but "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" and "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" regardless of health insurance status.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare [[cost-benefit analysis]]. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield]] employ large numbers of [[actuary|actuaries]] (colloquially known as "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/30/business/la-fi-health-insurance-20100730 Actuaries, HMOs, and State Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows:{{quotation|The least costly treatment should be provided unless there is substantial evidence that a more costly intervention is likely to yield a superior outcome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Weber, ''Business Ethics in Healthcare: Beyond Compliance'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This generalized rule for healthcare institutions "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of [[stewardship]] of resources," especially since "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; And lastly, [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] have been cited as major precipitants of increasing healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headaches.about.com/cs/advocacy/a/lamus_cala.htm Are Frivolous Lawsuits Driving Up Healthcare Costs?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy of healthcare==
{{Further|Health care politics}}
In the [[political philosophy]] of healthcare, the debate between [[universal healthcare]] and [[private healthcare]] is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives by the federal government to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]], the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of [[socialized medicine]], many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage.&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does It Mean?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013858/http://cesr.org/ushealthright |date=27 September 2007 }} (29 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.&lt;ref name="LeonardPeikoff"&gt;Leonard Peikoff, [http://afcm.org/hcinar2.html "Health Care Is Not a Right,"] (11 December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Medicare.gif|thumb|right|500px|U.S. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (2008)]]

===Patients' Bill of Rights===
{{Further|U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights}}
In 2001, the U.S. federal government took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended ideas of the [[Consumer Bill of Rights|Consumers' Bill of Rights]] with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken in an effort to ensure the quality of care of all patients by preserving the integrity of the processes that occur in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html Summary of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414202540/http://democrats.senate.gov/pbr/summary.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many [[interest group]]s, including the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[Pharmaceutical lobby|Big Pharma]] came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of [[health insurance]] status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill.&lt;ref name="democrats.senate.gov"/&gt; As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2002.

===Health insurance===
[[File:Tommydouglas1945.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tommy Douglas|Tommy Douglas']] (centre left)  number one concern was the creation of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canadian Medicare]]. In the summer of 1962,  [[Saskatchewan]] became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's  physicians, who brought things to a halt with a doctors' strike.]]
{{Further|Health insurance}}
Health insurance is the primary mechanism through which individuals cover healthcare costs in [[industrialized countries]]. It can be obtained from either the [[government|public]] or [[corporation|private]] sector of the economy. In Canada, for example, the [[Canadian provinces|provincial governments]] administer public health insurance coverage to citizens and permanent residents. According to Health Canada, the political philosophy of public insurance in Canada is as follows:{{quotation|The administration and delivery of health care services is the responsibility of each province or territory, guided by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]]. The provinces and territories fund these services with assistance from the federal government in the form of fiscal transfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php Provincial/Territorial Role in Health]&lt;/ref&gt;}} And the driving force behind such a political philosophy in Canada was [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] politician [[Tommy Douglas]].

Contrasting with the U.S., but similar to Canada, Australia and New Zealand have [[universal healthcare]] systems known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and ACC ([[Accident Compensation Corporation]]), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/ Medicare Australia][http://www.acc.co.nz/index.htm ACC Government Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Medicare originated with [[Health Insurance Act 1973]]. It was introduced by Prime Minister (PM) [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Labor Government, and was intended to provide affordable treatment by doctors in public hospitals for all resident citizens. Redesigned by PM [[Bob Hawke]] in 1984, the current Medicare system permits citizens the option to purchase private health insurance in a [[two-tier health care|two-tier health system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/nphc-draftreportsupp-toc~nphc-draftreportsupp-ch3#.T2JX3GJWpss Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Considering the rapid pace at which the fields of medicine and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the [[phenomenon]], from which the research question is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research [[methodology]], design, and methods to fulfill the purposes of the research."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," ''Beyond Method: Philosophical Conversations in Healthcare Research and Scholarship'' Ed. Pamela M. Ironside (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her scientific inquiries rather than the research itself. Even so, "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', fixed and unchanging."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, viewpoints on scientific inquiries into healthcare matters "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world."&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, "Combining Interpretive Methodologies: Maximizing the Richness of Findings," 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical trials===
{{Further|Clinical trials}}
Clinical trials are a means through which the healthcare industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device. The traditional methodology behind clinical trials consists of various phases in which the emerging product undergoes a series of intense tests, most of which tend to occur on interested and/or compliant patients. The U.S. government has an established network for tackling the emergence of new products in the healthcare industry. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from [[pharmaceutical]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/7086fnl.htm Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers in Exploratory Drug Studies (FDA January 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the FDA, the [[National Institutes of Health]] sets the guidelines for all kinds of clinical trials relating to [[infectious diseases]]. For cancer, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) sponsors a series or cooperative groups like [[CALGB]] and [[Children's Oncology Group|COG]] in order to standardize protocols for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/overview/mission Mission Statement of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ogco fda 1006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (2006)]]

===Quality assurance===
{{Further|Quality assurance}}
The primary purpose of quality assurance (QA) in healthcare is to ensure that the quality of patient care is in accordance with established guidelines. The government usually plays a significant role in providing structured guidance for treating a particular disease or ailment. However, protocols for treatment can also be worked out at individual healthcare institutions like hospitals and HMOs. In some cases, quality assurance is seen as a superfluous endeavor, as many healthcare-based QA organizations, like [[QARC]], are publicly funded at the hands of taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"&gt;[http://www.qarc.org/ Quality Assurance Review Center]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people would agree that healthcare quality assurance, particularly in the areas cancer treatment and disease control are necessary components to the vitality of any legitimate healthcare system. With respect to quality assurance in cancer treatment scenarios, the [[Quality Assurance Review Center]] (QARC) is just one example of a QA facility that seeks "to improve the standards of care" for patients "by improving the quality of clinical trials medicine."&lt;ref name="Quality Assurance Review Center"/&gt;

==Birth and death==

===Reproductive rights===
{{Further|Abortion}}
The [[ecophilosophy]] of [[Garrett Hardin]] is one perspective from which to analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since they do a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', Hardin states,{{quotation|To couple the concept of [[liberty|freedom]] to breed with the belief that everyone born has an equal right to the commons is to lock the world into a tragic course of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html Garrett Hardin, "Freedom to Breed is Intolerable," ''The Tragedy of the Commons'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} By encouraging the freedom to breed, the [[welfare state]] not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one particular method to mitigate healthcare costs. With respect to population growth, the fewer people there are to take care of, the less expensive healthcare will be. And in applying this [[logic]] to what medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber previously suggested, less expensive healthcare does not necessarily mean poorer quality healthcare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Birth and living===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The concept of being "''well-born''" is not new, and may carry racist undertones. The [[Nazis]] practiced [[eugenics]] in order to cleanse the gene pool of what were perceived to be unwanted or harmful elements. This "race hygiene movement in Germany evolved from a [[theory]] of [[Social Darwinism]], which had become popular throughout Europe" and the United States during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'' (Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2005), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A German phrase that embodies the nature of this practice is ''lebensunwertes Leben'' or "life unworthy of life."&lt;ref&gt;Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with healthcare philosophy, the theory of [[natural rights]] becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed with a series of natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher [[John Locke]]. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states,{{quotation|If God's purpose for me on [[Earth]] is my survival and that of my species, and the means to that survival are my life, health, liberty and property — then clearly I don't want anyone to violate my rights to these things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/#HumNatGodPur John Locke, "Human Nature and God's Purposes," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although partially informed by his [[religion|religious]] understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a [[human rights|human right]] becomes relevant.

The process of preserving and maintaining one's health throughout life is a matter of grave concern. At some point in every person's life, his or her health is going to decline regardless of all measures taken to prevent such a collapse. Coping with this inevitable decline can prove quite problematic for some people. For [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], the depressing and gerontological implications of [[aging]] pushed him to believe in the prospects of [[immortality]] through a wholesome [[faith]] in the possibilities of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#PosHumFre René Descartes, "Possibility and Human Freedom," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and dying===
{{Further|Euthanasia}}
One of the most basic human rights is the right to live, and thus, preserve one's life. Yet one must also consider the right to die, and thus, end one's life. Often, religious values of varying traditions influence this issue. Terms like "mercy killing" and "assisted suicide" are frequently used to describe this process. Proponents of [[euthanasia]] claim that it is particularly necessary for patients suffering from a terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callahan, "Terminating Life-Sustaining Treatment of the Demented," ''Bioethics'' Ed. John Harris (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of a self-chosen death purport that it is not only immoral, but wholly against the pillars of reason.

In a certain philosophical context, death can be seen as the ultimate [[Existential crisis|existential]] moment in one's life. Death is the deepest cause of a primordial [[anxiety]] (''Die Anfechtung'') in a person's life. In this emotional state of anxiety, "the Nothing" is revealed to the person. According to twentieth-century [[Germans|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]],{{quotation|The Nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?" ''Basic Writings'' Ed. David Krell (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;}} And thus, for Heidegger, humans finds themselves in a very precarious and fragile situation (constantly hanging over the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]]) in this world. This concept can be simplified to the point where at bottom, all that a person has in this world is his or her [[Being]]. Regardless of how individuals proceed in life, their existence will always be marked by [[wikt:finitude|finitude]] and [[solitude]]. When considering near-death experiences, humans feels this primordial anxiety overcome them. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize the onset of this entrenched [[wiktionary:despair|despair]] in patients who are nearing their respective deaths.

Other philosophical investigations into death examine the healthcare's profession heavy reliance on science and technology (SciTech). This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang [[allusion]] to this reliance in what he calls the allure or "character of exactness."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "What Is Metaphysics?," 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, people are inherently attached to "exactness" because it gives them a sense of purpose or reason in a world that is largely defined by what appears to be [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and irrationality. And as the moment of death is approaching, a moment marked by utter confusion and fear, people frantically attempt to pinpoint a final sense of meaning in their lives.

Aside from the role that SciTech plays in death, [[palliative care]] constitutes a specialized area of healthcare philosophy that specifically relates to patients who are terminally ill. Similar to [[hospice]] care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. Even though the terms "'''palliative'''" and "'''hospice'''" are typically used interchangeably, they are actually quite different. As a patient nears the end of his life, it is more comforting to be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. Palliative care has generally been reserved for those who have a [[terminal illness]]. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capc.org/palliative-care-across-the-continuum/ "Palliative Care across the Continuum" ''Center to Advance Palliative Care'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role development==
The manner in which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators interact is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers can be seen as being in a privileged position, whereby they have the power to alter the patients' quality of life. And yet, there are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise. Effects stemming from a "gender gap" between nurses and doctors are detrimental to the professional environment of a hospital workspace.&lt;ref&gt;Mary W. Stewart, "The Social Context of Professional Nursing," ''Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice'' Ed. Kathleen Masters (Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Health Information Network (PHIN)''' is a national initiative, developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), for advancing fully capable and interoperable information systems in public health organizations.  The initiative involves establishing and implementing a framework for public health information systems.

== PHIN Design ==
PHIN is designed to do the following: 
* Enable the consistent exchange of health data
* Protect the security of the health data exchanged
* Ensure that the network will be available at all times

=== PHIN Structure ===
The 5 Functional Areas of PHIN:
#Detection and Monitoring
#Data Analysis
#Knowledge Management
#Alerting
#Response

== PHIN's Impact on Public Health ==
PHIN attempts to provide the public health sector with continuous access to necessary health care information.  Access to near real-time data attempts to improve community based interventions that are implemented as a result of terrorism or disease outbreaks.

PHIN provides supports and helps improve the outcomes of various public health programs including the following:

* The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]
**Desired outcome: improving public health information systems.
* The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
**Supports: Terrorism Defense, Healthcare Delivery Improvement, and IT Enhancements.
* [[Healthy People 2010]]
**Supports: Focus area 23 - ensure that public health agencies have the adequate infrastructure to effectively provide essential public health services.
* Partners in public health
**Desired outcome: "Roadmap" for establishing national capacity for public health systems.

== Budget and funding ==
PHIN first received funding in 2004 through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Between 25% and 30% of the $849 million of funding received through the Public Health Response and Preparedness Cooperative Agreement was to be used to focus on improving public health preparedness in all 50 states, 4 metropolitan areas and 8 US territories.  In 2004 the initiative of the program was to "ensure that all public health partners have, or at least will have, access to a system or systems to accomplish established preparedness functions."  For year 2005, additional finances will be available to states through the terrorism cooperative agreement.  This agreement will support the development of current and new systems, in state health and public health departments, which will meet the PHIN standards and specifications.

== Partnerships ==
In order to collect and assess information system requirements for PHIN, the CDC works with public health partners, some of which include:
*NACCHO - [[National Association of County and City Health Officials]]
*ASTHO - Association of State and Territorial Health Officials

With the assistance of these partners, PHIN can target the following functional areas regarding preparedness:
#Early Event Detection
#Outbreak Management
#Connecting Laboratory Services
#Partner Communications and Alerting
#Countermeasure/Response Administration

== Governance ==

The approval of technical and data standards for PHIN is completed by two working groups in the CDC Information Council (CIC).  The following organizations are represented on each working group by 2 members of its staff:  Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), [[National Association of County and City Health Officials]] (NACCHO), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  By regulation the standards conform to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements and the Federal Health architecture.

CIC also ensures that the following standards are met:
*E-Gov activities, which includes all regulations contained in the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) goals
*Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) initiative
*Federal Geographic Data Committee standards required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-16
*Public Health line of business and Public Health Monitoring Sub-function of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model

== Preparedness ==
=== Early Event Detection ===

In the realm of preparedness, the PHIN has developed systems to promote early event detection.  Information systems that connect health care providers to the PHIN allow for rapid reporting of cases that may lead to public health emergencies.  These information systems include call reporting systems, web-based systems, and other electronic case reporting systems.  The PHIN has set up technical requirements so that facilities can be equipped to participate in these rapid reporting systems.  These requirements also ensure that facilities can protect patient privacy in their reports and ensure integration with outbreak management.

=== Outbreak Management ===

Another component in preparedness, the PHIN has a division of outbreak management which allows public health agencies to be adequately prepared for true outbreaks.  The outbreak management system is integrated with the early event detection systems to ensure rapid, smooth awareness of outbreaks.  The CDC and PHIN currently employ an Outbreak Management System software application to effectively manage data related to outbreaks.

== Connecting Laboratories ==

Another component of PHIN is connecting laboratories through a set of computer communication standards called HL7.  This allows specimen receipts and laboratory results to be exchanged between health organizations and agencies.  This is especially useful in times of a health outbreak or other disaster.

== Countermeasure and Response Administration ==

The PHIN also works to track and support the supply of vaccinations and as well as the administration of these tasks.  As part of this functionality, the PHIN allows limited supplies of vaccines and other needed drugs to be allocated properly when they are in short supply. Some vaccines and drugs will be traceable to clinics and drug administrators.  PHIN also supports response administration by allowing adverse events to be monitored and quarantined populations to be monitored if necessary.

== Standards and Specifications  ==

PHIN has a set of Vocabulary Standards and Specifications that:
# Supports the development and deployment of standards-based public health information systems.
# Seeks to promote the use of standards-based vocabulary
# Fosters the use and exchange of consistent information among public health collaborators.
# Ensures that the vocabularies are aligned with PHIN and CHI standards.

'''Ripapa Island''', also known locally as '''Ripa Island''', just off the shore of [[Lyttelton Harbour]] (Whakaraupo) has played many roles in the history of New Zealand. The island initially played a key role in an internal struggle for the South Island [[Ngāi Tahu]] tribe in the early 19th Century. In the late 19th century the island was used as a [[quarantine station]] for ships arriving from Britain, though 1880 saw the use of the quarantine buildings as a prison, notably for members of the [[Parihaka]] Māori settlement in [[Taranaki]] during its [[passive resistance]] campaign against the surveying and selling of its land by the government.&lt;ref name=Kaupapa7&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080529073722/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/scripts/reports/reports/143/306CB8AF-6FE2-453A-8255-F37E43D45E77.pdf The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi by the Waitangi Tribunal, chapter 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; The quarantine buildings were dismantled when the Island was incorporated into the coastal defence scheme.&lt;ref name="DOC"&gt;http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/canterbury/christchurch-and-banks-peninsula/fort-jervois-ripapa-island/ DoC information on Ripapa Island&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-European history==
The site of Ripapa Island was perfect for building a [[Pā (Māori)|pā]] (a fortification built by the Māori) and in the early 19th Century, Chief Taununu of the Ngāi Tahu tribe built such a pā on the island. In the 1820s Chief Taununu faced a fierce fight with another Ngāi Tahu group, in what was to be known as the ''Kai Huanga'' feud. Kai Huanga, meaning "eat relatives", refers to the cannibalistic nature of the feud and that those they fought and ate were close relatives, even getting to a point where cousin would eat cousin.&lt;br&gt;
The Ngāi Tahu tribe continued to occupy the island until around 1832. Prior to this, Chief Te Whakarukeruke, who had been occupying Ripapa Island, left to help defend [[Kaiapoi]] from [[Te Rauparaha]]. After Kaiapoi fell, Te Rauparaha overran a number of pā on and around [[Banks Peninsula]], including the pā on Ripapa Island. The island was never again occupied by the Māori.

==Fort Jervois==
[[File:Derelict Armstrong guns Ripapa Island.JPG|right|thumb|Derelict Armstrong guns and emplacements.]]
[[File:8lb Armstrong gun, Ripapa Island.JPG|right|thumb|8-inch Armstrong gun mechanism.]]
Fort Jervois was built on Ripapa as one of the four defences set up in [[World War I]] to protect Lyttelton Harbour, and as part of the nationwide coastal defences. The walled fort that had been built in 1886 had been re-militarised as a result of a perceived [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The "Russian-scare" forts of 1885|Russian scare]] and is the most complete Russian scare fort left in New Zealand. The fort was occupied by the New Zealand army from the Russian scare till the end of [[World War I]] and was again garrisoned during [[World War II]]. Fort Jervois housed some prisoners of war during World War I including [[Felix von Luckner]].&lt;ref name="hero or braggart"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Munro |first1=Robin |title=War hero or a braggart? |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/mainlander/6742485/War-hero-or-a-braggart |accessdate=19 October 2014 |work=[[The Press]] |date=14 April 2012 |pages=C10–C11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort is currently the home of two extremely rare guns. One is a [[BL 8 inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 8-inch gun]] (one of only 12 left in the world), which is still in working order, though there are no shells left for such a weapon. It also holds a smaller [[BL 6 inch gun Mk I - VI|BL 6-inch gun]]. However, at the first test shot the recoil system failed, with the result that the barrel cracked and most of the rest of the gun was damaged and was returned to England for repairs. A test fire in 1939 cracked the mounting. Though these are the only two guns currently in place at Fort Jervois, there are emplacements for another two guns. These two guns are on the island but have been partially destroyed.

The island has been under the control of the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] since 1990. Fort Jervois is classed as a Category I historic place by [[Heritage New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|5306|Fort Jervois|25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been considered "actively managed" by Canterbury Conservancy. Future plans have been made to return the island to how it was during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="DOC"/&gt;

The [[June 2011 Christchurch earthquake]] damaged Fort Jervois and it is now closed. Once some remedial repairs are carried out, it may be opened to restricted access.&lt;ref name="DOC"/&gt;

The '''Russian famine of 1921–22''', also known as '''[[Volga region|Povolzhye]] famine''', was a severe [[famine]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] which began in early spring of 1921 and lasted through 1922. This famine killed an estimated 5 million, [[1921–22 famine in Tatarstan|primarily affecting]] the [[Volga region|Volga]] and [[Ural River]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1921-2/famine-of-1921-22/|title=Famine of 1921-22|date=2015-06-17|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheBlackBookofCommunism10/the-black-book-of-communism-jean-louis-margolin-1999-communism#page/n71/|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|last=Courtois|first=Stéphane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panné|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartošek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780674076082|location=|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine resulted from combined effects of economic disturbance—which had already started during [[World War I]], and continued through the disturbances of the [[Russian Revolution]]—and [[Russian Civil War]] with its policy of [[War communism|War Communism]], especially [[prodrazvyorstka]], exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food efficiently. The famine's primary causes were due to severe flooding in the Volga region in 1921, as well as the exacerbation of the Russian Civil War.

[[Droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|One of Russia's intermittent droughts]] in 1921 aggravated the situation to a national catastrophe. &lt;!-- In many cases recklessness of local administration, which recognized the problems too late, contributed to the problem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} (I will  place it somewhere into article body later; but it should be sourced first.) For example, in summer 1921, half of the arable area of [[Crimea]] was destroyed by drought, but the local bosses asked for help as late as in May 1922  --&gt;  Hunger was so severe, it was doubtful that seed-grain would be sown rather than eaten.  At one point, relief agencies had to give [[cereal|grain]] to railroad staff to get their supplies moved.

Before the famine began, Russia had suffered six and a half years of [[World War I]] and the Civil Wars of 1918–20, many of the conflicts fought inside Russia.{{Sfn |Kennan | 1961}}

Before the famine, all sides in the [[Russian Civil War]]s of 1918–21—the [[Bolsheviks]], the [[White movement|Whites]], the [[Anarchism|Anarchists]], the seceding nationalities—had provisioned themselves by seizing food from those who grew it, giving it to their armies and supporters, and denying it to their enemies. The Bolshevik government had requisitioned supplies from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange. This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production.  According to the official Bolshevik position, which is still maintained by some modern Marxists, the rich peasants ([[kulak]]s) withheld their surplus grain to preserve their lives;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wsws.org/correspo/1998/mar1998/leni-m06.shtml | contribution = An exchange of letters | publisher = BBC | type = documentary | title = Lenin's Secret Files | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.li/20070213155724/http://www.wsws.org/correspo/1998/mar1998/leni-m06.shtml | archivedate = 2007-02-13 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; statistics indicate that most of the grain and the other food supplies passed through the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, EH, 1966, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923'', Part 2, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase, WJ, 1987, ''Workers, Society and the Soviet State: Labour and Life in Moscow 1918–1929'' pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nove, A, 1982, ''An Economic History of the USSR'', p. 62, cited in {{cite web |last= Flewers |first= Paul |title= War Communism in Retrospect | url= http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext5/Warcomm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolsheviks believed peasants were actively trying to undermine the war effort. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'' asserts that Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain in retaliation for this "sabotage", leading to widespread peasant revolts.{{Sfn | Werth | Panné | Paczkowski | Bartosek | Margolin | 1999}} In 1920, Lenin ordered increased emphasis on food requisitioning from the peasantry.

Aid from outside Russia was initially rejected.  The [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA), which [[Herbert Hoover]] formed to help the victims of starvation of [[World War I]], offered assistance to Lenin in 1919, on condition that they have full say over the Russian railway network and hand out food impartially to all. Lenin refused this as interference in Russian internal affairs.{{Sfn |Kennan | 1961}}

Lenin was eventually convinced—by this famine, the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], large scale peasant uprisings such as the [[Tambov Rebellion]], and the failure of a German [[general strike]]—to reverse his policy at home and abroad. He decreed the [[New Economic Policy]] on March 15, 1921. The famine also helped produce an opening to the West: Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid this time. War relief was no longer required in Western Europe, and the ARA had an organization set up in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], relieving the Polish famine which had begun in the winter of 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E2D9123FE432A2575AC2A9679C946195D6CF|title= WILSON RENEWS HUNGER LOAN PLEA|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 January 1920|access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some peasants resorted to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;

Although no official request for aid was issued, a committee of well-known people without obvious party affiliations was allowed to set up an appeal for assistance. In July 1921, the writer [[Maxim Gorky]] published an appeal to the outside world, saying that millions of lives were menaced by crop failure. At a conference in [[Geneva]] on 15 August organised by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|League of Red Cross Societies]], the International Committee for Russian Relief (ICRR) was set up with Dr. [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its High Commissioner. Nansen headed to Moscow, where he signed an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] that left the ICRR in full control of its operations. At the same time, fundraising for the famine relief operation began in earnest in Britain, with all the elements of a modern emergency relief operation&amp;nbsp;— full-page newspaper advertisements, local collections, and a fundraising film shot in the famine area. By September, a ship had been despatched from London carrying 600 tons of supplies. The first feeding centre was opened in October in Saratov.

The main participants in the international relief effort were Hoover's [[American Relief Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.88967 | publisher = Newsreel | title= International news | volume = 442 | year = 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other bodies such as the [[American Friends Service Committee]] and the [[International Save the Children Union]], which had the British [[Save the Children| Save the Children Fund]] as the major contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/5RFHJY | title = Famine in Russia: the hidden horrors of 1921 | publisher = ICRC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around ten million people were fed, with the bulk coming from the ARA, funded by the [[United States Congress]]; the European agencies co-ordinated by the ICRR fed two million people a day: the International Save the Children Union were feeding 375,000 in its centres at [[Saratov]] at the height of the operation.&lt;ref name="Iconic"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRPHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 | title=The Making of Humanitarian Visual Icons: On the 1921-1923 Russian Famine as Foundational Event | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | work=Iconic Power: Materiality and Meaning in Social Life | date=3 January 2012 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | author=Kurusawa, Fuyuki | pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operation was hazardous&amp;nbsp;— several workers died of cholera&amp;nbsp;— and was not without its critics, including the London [[Daily Express]], which first denied the severity of the famine, and then argued that the money would better be spent in the United Kingdom.{{Sfn |Breen | 1994}}

Throughout 1922 and 1923, as famine was still widespread and the ARA was still providing relief supplies, grain was exported by the Soviet government to raise funds for the revival of industry; this seriously endangered Western support for relief, and was one instance of a long-standing Soviet policy of valuing development above the lives of the peasantry.  The new Soviet government insisted that if the AYA suspended relief, the ARA arrange a foreign loan for them of about $10,000,000 1923 dollars; the ARA was unable to do this, and continued to ship in food past the grain being sold abroad.&lt;ref name="Ellman"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = | first = Michael | last = Ellman | url =

==Death toll==
As with other large-scale famines, the range of estimates is considerable. An official Soviet publication of the early 1920s concluded that about five million deaths occurred in 1921 from famine and related disease: this number is usually quoted in textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lowe. Mastering Twentieth-Century Russian History. Palgrave, 2002. P. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; More conservative figures counted not more than a million, while another assessment, based on the ARA's medical division, spoke of two million.&lt;ref&gt;Betrand M. Patenaude. The Big Show in Bololand. The American Relief Expedition to Soviet Russia in the Famine of 1921. Stanford University Press, 2002. P. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the scale, some sources spoke of ten million dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/april/famine-040411.html How the U.S. saved a starving Soviet Russia: PBS film highlights Stanford scholar's research on the 1921-23 famine] Stanford News&lt;/ref&gt; According to Betrand M. Patenaude, "such a number hardly seems extravagant after the many tens of millions of victims of war, famine, and terror in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Patenaude, op. cit. p. 197-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political uses==
The famine came at the end of six and a half years of unrest and violence (first World War I, then the two Russian revolutions of 1917, then the Russian Civil War). Many different political and military factions were involved in those events, and most of them have been accused by their enemies of having contributed to, or even bearing sole responsibility for, the famine.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Since 1922, Bolsheviks started a campaign [[1922 confiscation of Russian Orthodox Church property|of seizing church property]]. In 1922, over 4.5 million [[Chervonets|golden rouble]]s of property were seized. Out of these, one million gold roubles were spent for famine relief.&lt;ref&gt;А. Г. Латышев. Рассекреченный Ленин. — 1-е изд. — М.: Март, 1996. — Pages 145—172. — 336 с. — 15 000 экз. — {{ISBN|5-88505-011-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a secret March 19, 1922 letter to the Politburo, Lenin expressed an intention to seize several hundred million golden roubles for famine relief.&lt;ref name=kri&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150225230446/http://elib.spbstu.ru/dl/327/Theme_10/Literature/Krivova.htm  Н.А. Кривова, "Власть и церковь в 1922-1925гг"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lenin's secret letter to the Politburo, Lenin explains that the famine provides an opportunity against the church.&lt;ref name=kri/&gt; [[Richard Pipes]] argued that the famine was used politically as an excuse for the Bolshevik leadership to persecute the Orthodox Church, which held significant sway over much of the peasant populace.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1995, pg. 415}}

Russian anti-Bolshevik exiles in London, Paris, and elsewhere also used the famine as a media opportunity to highlight the iniquities of the Soviet regime in an effort to prevent trade with and official recognition of the Bolshevik Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="After October: Russian Liberalism as a Work-in-Progress, 1917-1945"|last=Jansen|first=Dinah|publisher=Queen's University|year=2015|isbn=|location=Kingston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Slí-na-sláinte-sign.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Slí na Sláinte signpost in [[Galway]]]]
'''''Slí na Sláinte''''' ({{IPA-ga|ʃlʲi n̪ˠa sˠl̪ˠaːnʲtʲə}}, meaning "Path of health"), abbreviated '''SnaS''', is an initiative developed by the [[Irish Heart Foundation]], with the aim to encourage and increase the number of people walking in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It provides an easy accessible and inexpensive environment for regular exercise for walkers throughout the country.

Yellow signs on blue poles are placed at one-kilometre intervals along each established walking route. These signs allows walkers to keep track of how far they walk and the signs are not numbered so walkers can start and finish at whatever point they like.

Trained walking leaders promote and lead walks in their area, and run the "Slí Challenge" to help people calculate their time and distance walked to help them achieve awards when targets are met.

''Slí na Sláinte'' has grown to include a network of almost one hundred and fifty walking routes around Ireland, and the programme has been introduced in ten countries worldwide.

In [[Finland]], the [[smoking]] figures are among the lowest in Europe.&lt;ref name = "cancer"&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.cancer.fi/en/activities/health/ |title=Health Promotion |work=Cancer Society of Finland |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that have influenced the decrease in the smoking prevalence, such as legislative actions, health promotion and national monitoring systems, policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]] has the leading role in tobacco control in Finland, and one of their main aims is have a more effective ban on sale of tobacco products to children and young people and to prevent sale of illegal tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.stm.fi/en/welfare/substance_abuse/tobacco |title=MSAH oversees tobacco control in Finland  |work=Ministry of Social Affairs and Health |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key elements in the successful tobacco policy is the traditional collaboration between the health authorities and non-governmental organisations, and intensive health promotion.&lt;ref name = "cancer"/&gt;

Smoking in Finland has reduced, the smoking rates among adults in Finland in 2009 stood at 18.6%, lower than the OECD average of 22.3%.&lt;ref name = "oecd2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/44/40904932.pdf |title=How Does Finland Compare |work=OECD Health Data 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent study conducted in 2014 smoking rates for men was 17% and 14% for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helldán|first1=Anni|last2=Helakorpi|first2=Satu|title=Suomalaisen aikuisväestön terveyskäyttäytyminen ja terveys, kevät 2014 - Health Behaviour and Health among the Finnish Adult Population, Spring 2014|date=2015|publisher=THL|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-952-302-447-2|page=12|url=http://www.julkari.fi/handle/10024/126023|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decreasing trend the [[health effects of tobacco]] smoking are considerable and smoking can still be considered as a [[public health]] issue since it is still a significant cause of avoidable [[premature death]] and illness.&lt;ref name = "ash"&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.suomenash.fi/en/news/finland+tobacco-free+by+2040/ |title=Finland Tobacco-free by 2040 |work=Finland´s ASH |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The sale of tobacco to children under 18 is prohibited in Finland. Advertising of tobacco and strong alcohol is also prohibited.&lt;ref name = "hit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/80692/E91937.pdf |title=Finland - Health system review 2008|work=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking in Finland was first restricted in 1976 with a ban on [[tobacco advertising]].&lt;ref name="stub out smoking"&gt;{{cite news

The  reform of the Tobacco Act in June 2006 bans smoking in pubs and restaurants&lt;ref name = "hit"/&gt; And the most recent amendment to the Act on 2010 states that the retail trade in tobacco products are a subject to a license.

| accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation and pricing==

The state collected €655 million in tax revenue from taxation of tobacco products in 2010. Tax is collected from various tobacco products, but the vast majority of tax revenue comes from cigarettes.&lt;ref name = "vero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.veronmaksajat.fi/fi-FI/tutkimuksetjatilastot/kulutusverotus/tupakkavero/ |title=Tupakkaverotus eri EU-maissa |work=Veronmaksajat.fi |accessdate=2011-12-16 (in Finnish)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxation has a major effect on the cost of cigarettes, and tobacco products are ranked 10th most expensive among the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|EU27]] countries.&lt;ref name = "vero"/&gt; Tobacco taxation policy and price level in one Member State also affect tobacco consumption in other Member States. This is particularly apparent in Finland where the price of a Marlboro cigarette packet on 2005 was €4 but only €1.60 in Estonia,&lt;ref name = "allpolicies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/109146/E89260.pdf |title=Health in All Policies: Prospects and potentials |work=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is accessible by a two-hour boat drive and has a heavy tourist traffic from Finland.

==Smoking cessation initiatives==

[[Nicotine replacement therapy]] products are widely available in pharmacies and grocery stores, however they are relatively pricy which may not motivate smokers to quit. In addition to aid [[smoking cessation]] there are support networks, free of charge telephone ''quitline'' and several internet websites for smokers trying to quit.&lt;ref name = "ash"/&gt;

Finnish municipalities such as [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], [[Ylöjärvi]] and [[Espoo]] have banned smoking at their campuses,&lt;ref name="employees incentives"&gt;{{cite news   
| url=  http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/03/02/finnish-companies-offer-employees-incentives-to-stop-smoking/
| title= Finnish companies offer employees incentives to stop smoking
| publisher=  IceNews
| date=  2 March 2010
| accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some companies have offered cash bonuses of up to €1,000 [[euro]] to employees who quit smoking.&lt;ref name="employees incentives" /&gt;

==Snus==
{{main article|Snus}}
{{see also|Smokeless tobacco}}

Aside from cigarettes, another common tobacco product used in Finland, [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] is [[snus]], which is made from air dried tobacco. It is consumed by placing it under the lip for extended periods of time. The [[European Union]] banned the sale of snus in 1992, after a 1985 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051015073701/http://www-cie.iarc.fr/htdocs/monographs/vol37/tobaccosmokeless.html WHO study] concluded that "oral use of snuffs of the types used in North America and western Europe is [[carcinogen]]ic to humans". A WHO committee on tobacco has also acknowledged that evidence is inconclusive regarding health consequences for snus consumers.[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2009/0421/1224245059341.html] Only Sweden and [[EFTA]]-member Norway are exempt from this ban. A popular movement during the run-up to the 1994 referendum for Sweden's EU membership made exemption from the EU sale ban of snus a condition of the membership treaty. Finnish people purchase snus commonly from cruise ships that have a regular traffic between Finland and Sweden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2611">[[Image:Toilet Rim Block.jpg|right|thumb|235px|Location and close-up of Toilet rim block in its holder]]
A '''toilet rim block''' is a block-shaped substance used in [[flush toilet]]s which slowly dissolves in water. They often come in a small holder that is attached over the rim of a toilet and hangs down into the bowl, so as the toilet gets flushed, the water passes through the holder coming into contact with the block. 

However, they also come loose for placement directly ''in-cistern'' (so are also usable with [[squat toilet]]s), although these tend to be slightly different in composition, so as to dissolve slower, due to the constant contact with water. These may also contain a [[colorant]], which shows up in the water (typically blue or green).

In 'liquid rims' the liquid is held in a small bottle above and connected to the holder slowly releasing the liquid into the bottom of the holder which is beneath the toilet rim, so coming into contact with the water when the toilet is flushed.

==Composition and action==
Toilet rim blocks are marketed as [[disinfectant]]s and [[deodorizer]]s / [[air freshener]]s, allegedly also helping to prevent the buildup of [[limescale]] in the toilet bowl.

The composition of toilet blocks can vary, but they may contain, among other components, [[borax]] (one of the ingredients of many detergents), [[hydroxyethylcellulose]] ([[gelling agent]]), [[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate|troclosene sodium]]  (disinfectant), [[sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate]] ([[surfactant]]), [[sodium percarbonate]] (a form of oxygen [[bleach]]), [[sodium carbonate]] (washing soda) and various perfumes like e.g. [[limonene]], [[butylphenyl methylpropional]], and [[linalool]].&lt;ref name=sciproducts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scjproducts.info/corporate/include/pids_msds/documents/TOILET%20DUCK%20In%20Cistern.pdf|title= SC Johnson - Cistern Block data sheet|accessdate=21 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the closely related [[urinal deodorizer block]]s, some of the ingredients have [[irritating]] effects when applied to skin, eyes, or when swallowed. Their [[ecotoxicity]] is rated to be harmful to aquatic organisms and may have long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rb-msds.com.au/uploadedFiles/pdf/Harpic%20MAX%20Toilet%20Rim%20Block-v3-D0051287.pdf|title=Harpic Max toilet rim block, product safety sheet|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine''' ('''TRM''') is a central scientific institution of the  [[University of Leipzig]]. It focusses on the development of diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in the field of [[Regenerative medicine]] and their implementation into a clinical setting.

The TRM Leipzig was established in October 2006 with funds from the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], the [[Saxony|Free State of Saxony]] and the [[University of Leipzig]]. It is part of the Life Sciences Network Leipzig and one of the initiators of the [[Regenerative Medicine Initiative Germany]] (RMIG).

==Translation==
The TRM Leipzig aims to accelerate the translation of laboratory research in therapeutics and diagnostics into the clinic. The centre introduces an organisational process to assure the effective implementation of therapy-oriented gateway research. The foundation of this concept consists of an award system in which three main gates are conceived. Passing the gates precedes the conceptual, preclinical, and clinical working phases each new diagnostic or therapeutic concept has to go through. This enables the TRM Leipzig to ensure an effective translation in conjunction with a comprehensive support and coordination of research projects.

==Research==
The acting director of TRM Leipzig is Professor [[Frank Emmrich]]. The scientific work of TRM Leipzig is guided by two boards. The Executive Board provides the strategic direction of research at the TRM. Expertise and scientific support is given by the Internal Advisory Board which includes experts of science, senior scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs. TRM Leipzig promotes application-oriented and interdisciplinary research projects in four areas:
*[[Tissue Engineering]] und Materials Science (TEMAT)
*[[Cell therapy|Cell Therapies]] for Repair and Replacement (CELLT)
*Regulatory Molecules and Delivery Systems (REMOD)
*[[Medical imaging|Imaging]], Modelling and Monitoring of Regeneration (IMONIT)

The research areas of the TRM Leipzig are supported by three core units:
*Quality Management Core Unit (QMCU)
*Translational Surgery Core Unit (TSCU)
*Computational Microscopy Core Unit (CMCU)

==Awards==
The TRM Leipzig selects and funds investigator-initiated translational awards that supports young researchers pursuing their own therapy-oriented concepts and extending their innovation potential. Awards can be requested by individual researchers, scientific groups or tandem research teams consisting of clinicians and researchers. Applications for the awards can be submitted anytime.

His work includes the [[Cardinal Hill Reservoir]] (1931) in [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], [[Kentucky]]; the [[Saginaw Water Works]] plant in [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Michigan]]; the [[Westclox]] plant building in [[Peru, Illinois|Peru]], Illinois;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foter.com/Victor+Andre+Matteson/ Wilcox plant] photo.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[LaSalle Theater]] (1912) in [[LaSalle, Illinois|LaSalle]], Illinois.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;[http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/12735 LaSalle Theater] Cinema Treasures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteson became a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1917 and a [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities.aia.org/sites/hdoaa/wiki/Wiki%20Pages/ahd1028816.aspx].  [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was the son of Andre and Ellen C. (''née'' McNaughton) Matteson, grandson of Zerrubbable and Tryphena (''née'' Whitford) Matteson and great-grandson of William Matteson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minute Man''.  Volume 19. p. 89. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; His sister was Jean Matteson.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Jean Matteson, 77, Will Be Buried Today". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. June 13, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteson attended the [[University of Illinois]] (class of 1895) and was a member of the [[Kappa Kappa Fraternity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sigma Chi Quarterly: The Official Organ of the Sigma Chi''. Volume 38. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1919{{spaced ndash}} Greek letter societies Kappa Kappa Chapter — University of Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fraternity Men of Chicago''. 1898.  p. 172.  Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the 34th Annual Chicago Architectural Exhibit of 1924, Mattheson was listed in the index: "Matteson, V. A. (Hartford Building, Chicago) Entrance to Home of 'Big Ben', Western Clock Works La Salle, Ill."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/libraries/pubs/1921/AIC1921ChiArExh34thAn_comb.pdf] ([[PDF format]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteson was employed at the firm of [[Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White]] in Chicago.

At the 1933 dedication of [[Three Rivers Park]]{{clarify|date=July 2014|reason=the park linked is in Pittsburgh and has been "under development since 2000"}} (also site of the [[Three Rivers Water Filtration Plant]]) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Matteson commented that there is "no more beautiful spot could be wished for than the Three Rivers Park site, affording as it does a splendid view from across the rivers in any direction" and that "The exterior design of the building is not 'modernistic', but an adaptation of the spirit of the Gothic to modern requirements. Most of the pleasing architectural effect is secured by a careful study of mass and proportion, light and shade, and color… While the effect is rich and massive, befitting the purpose of so important a building to the community, the design is really one of extreme simplicity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoffortwayne.org/utilities/images/stories/images/trffinal.pdf "Three Rivers Water Filtration Plant"] ([[PDF format]]). City of Fort Wayne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteson was known for his water plant designs.&lt;ref name=mich/&gt; Matteson was a member of the [[American Water Works Association]] and had at least twenty years of experience in water plant design before planning the Saginaw Water Works plant. He wrote that "it is economic to give the public beautiful, as well as useful things, especially when one considers that of all the money expended on a complete water system, only about twenty-five percent of the total is applied to works above ground and visible."&lt;ref name=city&gt;[http://www.saginaw-mi.com/departments/watertreatment/artandarchitecture.php "Art and Architecture"] City of Saginaw, Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; including the "beautiful and functional" Saginaw Water Works plant.&lt;ref name=mich&gt;Kathryn Bishop Eckert [Buildings of Michigan] 1993 Page 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor{{when|date=July 2014|reason=context}} of ''[[American Architect and Architecture]]'', Matteson called for engineering to be included as an integral part of architecture. He wrote that "[a]rchitecture should be considered as the combined Art and Science of Building."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tamericanarchitec119newyuoft/tamericanarchitec119newyuoft_djvu.txt]. ''[[American Architect and Architecture]]''. Volume CXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Matteson died at age 78.   He is buried along in a plot alongside his parents at the [[Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Mattes&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GSob=n&amp;GScid=107767&amp;GRid=16257961&amp;].

[[Mumbai]] controls several dams in Shahpur taluk (Thane district) that deliver water to the city. The [[Western Ghats]] trap most of the moisture laden [[monsoon]] clouds which feed these dammed rivers. Currently, these dams deliver approximately 3.4 billion litres of water to Mumbai daily.  Here are the dams supplying the city the water it needs to survive:

The water treatment plant in [[Bhandup]], [[India]] is the largest and oldest in [[Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Bhandup complex is source of safe drinking water to the city|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/This-Bhandup-complex-is-source-of-safe-drinking-water-to-the-city/articleshow/54336531.cms|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Tansa Dam|Tansa]] and Vaitarna dams supply the southern region of Mumbai, while the rest supply the suburbs. An underground tank in [[Malabar Hill]]s is used to store the water.
