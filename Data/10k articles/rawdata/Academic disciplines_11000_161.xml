'''30th Central Scientific Research Institute, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]]''' (Name in Russian - 30-й центральный научно-исследовательский институт Министерства обороны Российской Федерации) was a scientific research organization operated by the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]] which was dedicated to leading a wide range of studies in support of enhancing the [[Russian Air Force| Russian Air Force's]] capabilities and development of the aerospace warfighting methods, technologies and complexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old.mil.ru/releases/2006/01/181527_12003.shtml Website of the Russian Ministry of Defence. 45th Anniversary of the TsNII-30. Air Force press release of 18.01.2006]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed on February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-language sources, the institute is often mentioned by the transliteration of its Russian abbreviation – TsNII-30.   
The institute was located in [[Shchyolkovo]] ({{lang-ru|Щёлково}}), [[Moscow Oblast]] at the [[Chkalovsky Airport]].

In 2010, TsNII-30 was reorganized and became an organizational unit of the {{Interlanguage link multi|4th Central Scientific Research Institute|ru|3=4-й центральный научно-исследовательский институт Министерства обороны Российской Федерации}}, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bazazakonov.ru/doc/index.php?ID=2206728 |title=Minister of Defence order of May 24, 2010 N 551 "On Reorganization of the federal state entities of the Ministry of Defence" |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042720/http://bazazakonov.ru/doc/index.php?ID=2206728 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=EXP;n=488230) из первоисточника 16 января 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

TsNII-30 has operated for exactly 50 years.

== History ==
TsNII-30 was established on January 16, 1961.

Its original name was the Central Scientific Research Institute, Russian Air Force. It was based on the Ministry of Defence Computer Center No. 3 in [[Noginsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]]. The center got the status of one of the TsNII-30 organizational units - Air Force Control Systems Research Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://anatoliy-artemyev.narod.ru/files/hroniki/04/4_0.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125415/http://anatoliy-artemyev.narod.ru/files/hroniki/04/4_0.htm |archive-date=2013-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — {{Interlanguage link multi|Научно-исследовательский центр систем управления ВВС|ru}}.
Later, TsNII-15, Russian Navy research institute, located in [[Leningrad]] was amalgamated with the TsNII-30 and became its subsidiary focused on the Navy aviation.

As of 2006, the institute's workforce had 16 [[Doctor of Science|Doctors of Science]] and 215 Ph.Ds ([[Candidate of Sciences|Candidates of Science]]).

The TsNII-30 has closely cooperated  with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Scientific Council of the Russian Air Force|ru|3=Научно-технический комитет Военно-воздушных сил}}, other Ministry of Defence research institutes (TsNII-46, TsNII-4, TsNII-16, etc.),  defence industry research institutes ([[GosNIIAS]], [[Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development]], [[TsAGI]], etc.), aviation design bureaus ([[Tupolev]], [[Mikoyan]], [[Antonov]], [[Yakovlev]], [[Ilyushin]], and Russian Academy of Sciences’ organizations.

=== Scope of Activities and Projects ===

'''Association for the Support of Contemporary Living''' ({{lang-tr|Çağdaş Yaşamı Destekleme Derneği}}) is a non-profit NGO in [[Turkey]]. The main office is in [[İstanbul]] and there are 103 branch offices nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp Branch office list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230000000/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association helps girls across Turkey obtain an education, ultimately promoting gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Istanbul|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melis-figanmese/women-of-istanbul_b_3081257.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Association for the Support of Contemporary Living (abbreviated ÇYDD) was founded on 10 February 1989 by a group of Turkish female academicians headed by [[Aysel Ekşi]] and [[Türkan Saylan]] in İstanbul.&lt;ref name="Tarih"&gt;[http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html Chronology from the ÇYDD youth page {{tr icon}})] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001114/http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next year Türkan Saylan was elected as the chairperson of the ÇYDD; from then on she became the symbol of ÇYDD. In the same year branch offices of ÇYDD began to be opened in other cities. In 1995 a subsidiary foundation of ÇYDD was founded. On 18 May 2009 Türkan Saylan died and in the next week, [[Aysel Çelikel]] a [[57th government of Turkey|former government]] minister became the next chairperson.&lt;ref name="Tarih"/&gt;

==Purpose==
ÇYDD supports the modernization [[Atatürk's reforms|reforms]] of [[Kemal Atatürk]]. The official statement of ÇYDD is 

:"The Association for Supporting Contemporary Life is a non-governmental organization, working voluntarily with its competencies and experience, aiming to protect Atatürk’s principles and revolutions, to reach contemporary society via contemporary education for contemporary people and to carry Turkey above the contemporary civilization level". “&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=22 Purpose declaration of ÇYDD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233839/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=22 |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ÇYDD is especially active in fighting against the gender discrimination and illiteracy of women.

== Achievements ==
*ÇYDD have awarded scholarships to 117,147 students.(54,657 girls in primary and secondary level and 63,497 students in university level) 
*ÇYYD has commissioned 130 schools or dormitory buildings
*ÇYDD have donated 319,000 books to various schools and established 20 libraries
*Following [[1999 İzmit earthquake]], ÇYDD established and opened 17 rehabilitation and community centers especially for the women and the children.
*ÇYDD established Human Rights Training at Coffee Houses . (This project is supported by [[European Union]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=50 Project page of ÇYDD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001107/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/sayfa.asp?id=50 |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy''' is a research center at the [[University at Buffalo]] that advances interdisciplinary research on law, legal institutions and social policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/about.html|title=About Us - Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Founded in 1978, the Baldy Center is housed within UB’s [[University at Buffalo Law School|School of Law]] but serves faculty with law and policy interests throughout the university. The Center was endowed by a bequest from Christopher Baldy, a prominent [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] attorney and UB School of Law graduate who died in 1959&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.buffalo.edu/news.host.html/content/shared/law/articles/introducing-sociology-to-law.detail.html|title=Baldy Center celebrates its 40th anniversary - University at Buffalo School of Law - University at Buffalo|website=www.law.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Activities ==
The Baldy Center sponsors interdisciplinary research focusing on the intersection of law and social policy, awarding research grants annually to scholars across the university, especially in law, the humanities and social sciences. It also hosts and sponsors conferences that bring together researchers from across the world to discuss their Law and Society-related research. A list of grants awarded for research and conferences and their recipients [http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/research/g-recipients.html is available] at the Center's website.

The Center’s intensive book manuscript workshops are organized around drafts of books about law, legal institutions or social policy by UB-affiliated scholars. The interdisciplinary discussions are designed to provide feedback to the authors from interested faculty and outside specialists.

The Baldy Center maintains cooperative ties to other interdisciplinary research centers and cosponsors a regional network of sociolegal scholars in New York and Canada. The Center additionally hosts distinguished scholars from around the world as visitors, speakers, consultants and conference participants.

The Center offers postdoctoral fellowships to budding scholars hoping to join the academy at American and global universities, along with research fellowships and senior fellowships. Research fellowships link law-and-policy scholars into the Baldy community and its resources, while senior fellowships are geared toward accomplished academics from other universities whose projects are closely related to the Baldy Center’s mission.

Through the Buffalo Legal Studies Research Paper Series, hosted and distributed by the Social Science Research Network, the Center provides an international audience for faculty and visiting scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter.html|title=Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Christopher Baldy graduated from the Buffalo School of Law in 1910, in the days when UB was a private school. He died a bachelor and left most of his estate, initially valued at $1.4 million, to his three brothers, stipulating that when they died, the remainder would be a gift to UB.

A surrogate judge in 1973 approved using the Baldy funding to start a new program in law and social policy, a subject area favored by UB’s law dean, Red Schwartz, a sociologist and the first-ever non-interim dean of an American law school who was not a lawyer. Schwartz was a key figure in the Law and Society movement that emerged in the 1960s and sought to explore how the law actually interacted with society, as opposed to the more formalistic, theoretical and academic approach that permeated legal scholarship for much of the 20th century.

Five years later, under then-Dean Thomas Headrick, the program in law and social policy was formalized into the Baldy Center&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

From 1981 to 2009, the Center hosted the peer-reviewed academic journal Law &amp; Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For much of its history, the Baldy Center’s activities were organized around working groups focused on specific research areas. The number of groups fluctuated over time and during the 1990s were concentrated into more formal Baldy Programs such as Environmental Law and Policy; Children, Families and the Law; Community and Difference; Law, Gender and Social Policy; Human Rights Law and Policy; and Regulation and Public Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=61-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After 2010, the Center retired the working groups model and instituted its fellowship program while continuing to focus on conferences, book manuscript workshops and supporting research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">'''Biomagnetism''' is the phenomenon of [[magnetic field]]s ''produced'' by living organisms; it is a subset of [[bioelectromagnetism]]. In contrast, organisms' use of magnetism in navigation is [[magnetoception]] and the study of the magnetic fields' ''effects'' on organisms is ''[[magnetobiology]]''. (The word biomagnetism has also been used loosely to include magnetobiology, further encompassing almost any combination of the words magnetism, cosmology, and biology, such as "magnetoastrobiology".)

The origin of the word biomagnetism is unclear, but seems to have appeared several hundred years ago, linked to the expression "[[animal magnetism]]". The present scientific definition took form in the 1970s, when an increasing number of researchers began to measure the magnetic fields produced by the human body. The first valid measurement was actually made in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Baule G.M, McFee R. Detection of the magnetic field of the heart. ''American Heart Journal'' 1963;66:95-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but the field of research began to expand only after a low-noise technique was developed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen D, Edelsack EA, Zimmerman JE. Magnetocardiograms taken inside a shielded room with a superconducting point contact magnetometer. ''Applied Physics Letters'' 1970;16(7): 278-80&lt;/ref&gt; Today the community of biomagnetic researchers does not have a formal organization, but international conferences are held every two years, with about 600 attendees. Most conference activity centers on the MEG ([[magnetoencephalogram]]), the measurement of the magnetic field of the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">The term '''cohort effect''' is used in [[social science]] to describe variations in the characteristics of an area of study (such as the incidence of a characteristic or the age at onset) over time among individuals who are defined by some shared temporal experience or common life experience, such as year of birth, or year of exposure to radiation.

Cohort effects are important to [[epidemiologists]] searching for patterns in illnesses.  Certain illnesses may be socially affected via the [[Anticipation (genetics)|anticipation phenomenon]], and cohort effects can be an indicator of this sort of phenomenon.

Cohort effects are important to resource dependency and economics theorists when these groups affect structures of influence within their larger organizations. Cohorts in organizations are often defined by entry or birth date, and retain some common characteristic (size, cohesiveness, competition) that can affect the organization. For example, cohort effects are critical issues in school enrollment. 

In order to determine whether a cohort effect is present, a researcher may conduct a [[cohort study]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17173">{{Distinguish|mass noun|collective number|collective numeral}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''collective noun''' refers to a collection of things taken as a whole. Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and ''not'' specific to just one kind, such as the word "group", which is applied to "people" in the phrase "a group of people", but is also applied to "dogs" in the phrase "a group of dogs". Other collective nouns ''are specific'' to one kind, especially [[#Terms of venery|terms of venery]], which identify specific groups of animals. For example, "pride" as a term of [[game (hunting)|venery]] always refers to [[lion]]s, never to [[dog]]s or [[cow]]s. Similarly, a group of owls is called a "parliament".{{citation needed| date= November 2018|reason= Not the word used in the main article linked to in the 'Terms of venery' section below}}

Different forms of English handle verb [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective [[count noun]]s differently; in particular, users of [[British English]] generally accept that collective nouns take either singular or plural verb forms depending on context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies.

== Derivation ==
[[Morphological derivation]] accounts for many collective words and various languages have common [[affix]]es for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.

== Affixes ==

=== Proto-Indo-European===
Early Proto-Indo-European used the suffix *eh2 to form collective nouns. From there we have, for example, the Latin neuter plural ending -a. Late Proto-Indo-European used the ending *t. From there we have the English ending -th, as in "youth".

=== English ===
The English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes, the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' Though the [[etymology]] is plain to see, the derived words take on a distinct meaning. This is a [[Productive (linguistics)|productive]] ending, as evidenced in the recent [[Coined word|coin]], "[[signage]]".

=== German ===
[[German language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:ge-#German|ge]]-'' to create collectives. The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in that way are of [[neuter gender]]:
* ''{{lang|de|das Gebirge}}'', "group of hills, mountain range" {{abbr|&lt;|from}} ''{{lang|de|der Berg}}'', "mountain" or "hill"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gepäck}}'', "luggage, baggage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|der Pack}}'', "pack, bundle, pile"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geflügel}}'', "poultry, fowl (birds)" &lt; late [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''{{lang|gmh|gevlügel(e)}}'', under the influence of ''{{lang|de|der Flügel}}'', "wing" &lt; MHG ''{{lang|gmh|gevügel}}'' &lt; [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|gifugili}}'' = collective formation of ''{{lang|goh|fogal}}'', "bird"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gefieder}}'', "plumage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Feder}}'', "feather"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geschwisterkind}}'', "sibling" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* ''{{lang|de|die Geschwister}}'', "siblings" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* "Der Gebirgszug" and "die Bergkette" also mean "mountain range", drawing on the words "der Zug" = train, and "die Kette" = chain.
There are also several endings that can be used to create collectives, such as "welt" and "masse".

=== Dutch ===
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar pattern but sometimes uses the (unproductive) [[circumfix]] ''{{linktext|ge- -te}}'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Morphology of Dutch|last=Booij|first=Geert|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{lang|nl|berg}}'' 'mountain' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebergte}}'' 'mountain range'
* ''{{lang|nl|been}}'' 'bone' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebeente}}'' 'skeleton'
* ''{{lang|nl|vogel}}'' 'bird' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gevogelte}}'' 'poultry'
* ''{{lang|nl|blad}}'' 'leaf' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebladerte}}'' 'foliage'

=== Swedish ===
The following [[Swedish language|Swedish]] example has different words in the collective form and in the individual form:
* An individual mosquito is a ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygga|mygga]]}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:myggor|myggor]]}}''), but mosquitos as a collective is ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygg|mygg]]}}''.

=== Esperanto ===
[[Esperanto]] uses the collective suffix -''[[wikt:-ar#Esperanto|ar]]'' to produce a large number of derived words:
* ''monto'' 'mountain' &gt; ''montaro'' 'mountain range'
* ''birdo'' 'bird' &gt; ''birdaro'' 'flock'
* ''arbo'' 'tree' &gt; ''arbaro'' 'forest'
* ''ŝipo'' 'ship' &gt; ''ŝiparo'' 'fleet'
* ''manĝilo'' 'eating utensil' &gt; ''manĝilaro'' 'silverware', 'cutlery'

== Metonymic merging of grammatical number ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}{{Main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}Two good examples of collective nouns are "team" and "government", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both "team" and "government" are [[count noun]]s (consider: "one team", "two teams", "most teams"; "one government", "two governments", "many governments").

=== Agreement in different forms of English ===
{{Main|American and British English grammatical differences#Subject-verb_agreement}}

Confusion often stems from the way that different forms of English handle [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective nouns—specifically, whether or not to use the '''collective singular''': the singular verb form with a collective noun. The [[plural verb]] forms are often used in [[British English]] with the singular forms of these [[count noun]]s (e.g., "The team ''have'' finished the project."). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in "-s" that were once considered plural (e.g., "Physics ''is'' my favorite academic subject"). This apparent "number mismatch" is a natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the concepts underlying the words.

In British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies. For example, "the team ''is'' in the dressing room" (''[[formal agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, while "the team ''are'' fighting among themselves" (''[[notional agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. That is also the British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts (e.g., "[[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] ''have'' won the competition.").

In [[American English]], collective nouns almost always take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases that a metonymic shift would be revealed nearby, the whole sentence should be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, "The team are fighting among themselves" may become "the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves" or simply "The team is infighting.") Collective [[proper noun]]s are usually taken as singular ("[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is expected to release a new phone this year"), unless the plural is explicit in the proper noun itself, in which case it is taken as plural ("The [[Green Bay Packers]] are scheduled to play the [[Minnesota Vikings]] this weekend").
More explicit examples of collective proper nouns include "[[General Motors]] is once again the world's largest producer of vehicles," and "[[Texas Instruments]] is a large producer of [[electronics]] here," and "[[British Airways]] is an airline company in Europe." Furthermore, "[[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]" is a [[telecommunications]] company in North America." Such phrases might look plural, but they are not.

=== Examples of metonymic shift ===
A good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally, occurs only in British English) is the following sentence: "The team have finished the project." In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, but they are still discrete individuals; the word choice "team have" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: "Mathematics is my favorite academic subject." The word "mathematics" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift (the shift in concept from "the endeavors" to "the whole set of endeavors") produced the usage of "mathematics" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of "mathematics" followed naturally.)

Nominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns. For example, it is correct usage in both British English and American English usage to say: "None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right." In that case, the plural verb is used because the context for "none" suggests more than one thing or person.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk &amp; White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:
*"[[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] ''was'' founded in [[El Cerrito, California]]".
*"[[Nintendo]] ''is'' a [[video game]] company headquartered in Japan".

This does not, however, affect the tense later in the sentence:
*"Cream ''is'' a [[psychedelic rock]] band who ''were'' primarily popular in the 1960s.

== Terms of venery ==
{{further|List of English terms of venery, by animal}}
The tradition of using "terms of [[game (hunting)|venery]]" or "nouns of assembly", collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals, stems from an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[medieval hunting|hunting tradition]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from [[medieval France|France]]. It was marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. The elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, the tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.

''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'', written by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]] in the mid-1200s, is the earliest source for collective nouns of animals in any European vernacular (and also the earliest source for animal noises).&lt;ref&gt;William Sayers, "Animal vocalization and human polyglossia in Walter of Bibbesworth's 13th-century domestic treatise in Anglo-Norman French" in Sign System Studies (Tartu, 2009) pp. 173–187&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Venerie'' of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of [[droppings]] of animals, and three different terms for [[herd]]s of animals. [[Gaston Phoebus]] (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the ''Master of the Game'' (early 15th century). The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerged in the later 15th century. Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of "termis of venery &amp;c.''"'', extends to 70 items,&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, ''Lexicon of the Mediaeval German Hunt: A Lexicon of Middle High German Terms (1050–1500), Associated with the Chase, Hunting with Bows, Falconry, Trapping and Fowling'', Walter de Gruyter, 1965, {{ISBN|978-3-11-081860-4}}, p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt; and the list in the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' (1486) runs to 165 items, many of which, even though introduced by "the compaynys of beestys and fowlys", relate not to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous, such as "a Doctryne of doctoris"'', "''a Sentence of Juges"'', "''a Fightyng of beggers"'', "''an uncredibilite of Cocoldis"'', "''a Melody of harpers"'', "''a Gagle of women"'', "''a Disworship of Scottis", etc.&lt;ref&gt;1901 facsimile reprint, E. Stock, London ([https://archive.org/stream/bokeofsaintalban00bernuoft#page/114/mode/2up pp. 115-117).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Philological Society
Volume 26, Issue 3, pages 79–175, August 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Book of Saint Albans'' became very popular during the 16th century and was reprinted frequently. [[Gervase Markham]] edited and commented on the list in his ''The Gentleman's Academic'', in 1595. The book's popularity had the effect of perpetuating many of these terms as part of the [[Standard English]] lexicon even if they have long ceased to have any practical application.&lt;ref name="Todd&amp;Hancock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Loreto |author2=Hancock, Ian | year = 1986 | title = International English Usage | publisher = Psychology Press | pages = 133–134 | isbn = 0-415-05102-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iccd5KAUnYQC&amp;pg=PA133 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in their original context of medieval venery, the terms were of the nature of [[kenning]]s, intended as a mark of erudition of the gentlemen able to use them correctly rather than for practical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Exaltation of Larks|last=Lipton|first=James|publisher=Penguin|year=1993|isbn=978-0140170962|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the terms in the modern period has resulted in the addition of numerous lighthearted, humorous or facetious&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literacy Dictionary|last=Harris|first=Theodore L.|author2=Hodges, Richard E.|publisher=International Reading Association|year=1995|isbn=0-87207-138-3|page=271}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; collective nouns.

'''Computational particle physics''' refers to the methods and computing tools developed in and used by  [[particle physics]] research. Like [[computational chemistry]] or [[computational biology]], it is, for [[particle physics]] both a specific branch and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science, theoretical and experimental particle physics and mathematics.
The main fields of computational particle physics are: [[lattice field theory]] (numerical computations), [[automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay]] (computer algebra) and [[event generator]]s (stochastic methods).

==Computing tools==

==History==

Particle physics played a role in the early history of the internet, the [[World-Wide Web]] was created by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] when working at CERN in 1991.

=== Computer Algebra ===
Note: This section contains an excerpt from 'Computer Algebra in Particle Physics' by Stefan Weinzierl

Particle physics is an important field of application for computer algebra and exploits the capabilities of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). This leads to valuable feed-back for the development of CAS. Looking at the history of [[computer algebra systems]], the first programs date back to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first systems were almost entirely based on [[LISP| LISP ("LISt Programming language")]]. LISP is an [[interpreted language]] and, as the name already indicates, designed for the manipulation of [[List (abstract data type)|lists]]. Its importance for [[symbolic computing|symbolic computer programs]] in the early days has been compared to the importance of FORTRAN for numerical programs in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Already in this first period, the program [[REDUCE]] had some special features for the application to high energy physics. An exception to the LISP-based programs was [[SCHOONSHIP]], written in [[assembler language]] by [[Martinus J. G. Veltman]] and specially designed for applications in particle physics. The use of assembler code lead to an incredible fast program (compared to the interpreted programs at that time) and allowed the calculation of more complex [[scattering]] processes in high energy physics. It has been claimed the program's importance was recognized in 1998 by awarding the half of the Nobel prize to Veltman.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also the program [[MACSYMA]]  deserves to be mentioned explicitly, since it triggered important development with regard to algorithms. In the 1980s new computer algebra systems started to be written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. This enabled the better exploitation of the [[computer memory|resources]] of the computer (compared to the interpreted language LISP) and at the same time allowed to maintain [[Software portability|portability]] (which would not have been possible in assembler language). This period marked also the appearance of the first commercial computer algebra system, among which Mathematica and [[Maple (software)|Maple]]  are the best known examples. In addition, also a few dedicated programs appeared, an example relevant to particle physics is the program FORM by J. Vermaseren as a (portable) successor to SCHOONSHIP. More recently issues of the [[software maintenance|maintainability]] of large projects became more and more important and the overall [[programming paradigm]]a changed from [[procedural programming]] to [[object-oriented]] design. In terms of programming languages this was reflected by a move from C to [[C++]]. Following this change of paradigma, the library GiNaC was developed. The GiNac library allows symbolic calculations in C++. 

[[Automatic_programming#Implementations|Code generation for computer algebra]] can also be used in this area.

=== Lattice field theory ===

[[Lattice field theory]] was created by [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'' Kenneth G. Wilson, Confinement of quarks, Physical Review D, 10, 1974, p. 2445–59 ''&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation techniques were later developed from statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1982). "Microcanonical Ensemble Formulation of Lattice Gauge Theory". Physical Review Letters 49 (9): 613–616. Bibcode 1982PhRvL..49..613C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.613.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1983). "Lattice gauge theory in the microcanonical ensemble". Physical Review D28 (6): 1506–1514. Bibcode 1983PhRvD..28.1506C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.28.1506. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s, LQCD researchers have pioneered the use of [[massively parallel]] computers in large scientific applications, using virtually all available computing systems including traditional main-frames, large [[computer cluster|PC clusters]], and high-performance systems. In addition, it has also been used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[high-performance computing]], starting with the IBM [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer.

Eventually national and regional QCD grids were created: LATFOR (continental Europe), UKQCD and USQCD. The ILDG (International Lattice Data Grid) is an international venture comprising grids from the UK, the US, Australia, Japan and Germany, and was formed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;'' C.M.

[[File:Ferro antiferro spatial corrs png.png|thumb|right|Schematic equal-time spin correlation functions for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials both above and below &lt;math&gt;T_\text{Curie}&lt;/math&gt; versus the distance normalized by the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases, correlations are strongest nearest to the origin, indicating that a spin has the strongest influence on its nearest neighbors. All correlations gradually decay as the distance from the spin at the origin increases. Above the Curie temperature, the correlation between spins tends to zero as the distance between the spins gets very large. In contrast, below &lt;math&gt;T_\text{Curie}&lt;/math&gt;, the correlation between the spins does not tend toward zero at large distances, but instead decays to a level consistent with the long-range order of the system. The difference in these decay behaviors, where correlations between microscopic random variables become zero versus non-zero at large distances, is one way of defining short- versus long-range order.]]

In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''correlation function''' is a measure of the order in a system, as characterized by a mathematical [[correlation function]]. Correlation functions describe how microscopic variables, such as spin and density, at different positions are related. More specifically, correlation functions quantify how microscopic variables co-vary with one another on average across space and time. A classic example of such spatial correlations is in ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials, where the spins prefer to align parallel and antiparallel with their nearest neighbors, respectively. The spatial correlation between spins in such materials is shown in the figure to the right.

==Definitions==
The most common definition of a correlation function is  the [[canonical ensemble]] (thermal) average of the scalar product of two random variables, &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;, at positions &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R+r&lt;/math&gt; and times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t+\tau&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;C (r,\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the brackets, &lt;math&gt;\langle ...  \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, indicate the above-mentioned thermal average. It is a matter of convention whether one subtracts the uncorrelated average product of &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; from the correlated product, &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with the convention differing among fields. The most common uses of correlation functions are when &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; describe the same variable, such as a spin-spin correlation function, or a particle position-position correlation function in an elemental liquid or a solid (often called a [[Radial distribution function]] or a pair correlation function). Correlation functions between the same random variable are [[autocorrelation function]]s. However, in statistical mechanics, not all correlation functions are autocorrelation functions. For example, in multicomponent condensed phases, the pair correlation function between different elements is often of interest. Such mixed-element pair correlation functions are an example of [[Cross-correlation|cross-correlation functions]], as the random variables &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the average variations in density as a function position for two distinct elements.

===Equilibrium equal-time (spatial) correlation functions===
Often, one is interested in solely the ''spatial'' influence of a given random variable, say the direction of a spin, on its local environment, without considering later times, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we neglect the time evolution of the system, so the above definition is re-written with &lt;math&gt;\tau = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This defines the '''equal-time correlation function''', &lt;math&gt;C(r,0)&lt;/math&gt;. It is written as:

&lt;math&gt;C (r,0) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, one omits the reference time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and reference radius, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, by assuming equilibrium (and thus time invariance of the ensemble) and averaging over all sample positions, yielding:

&lt;math&gt;C (r) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(r)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(r) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where, again, the choice of whether to subtract the uncorrelated variables differs among fields. The [[Radial distribution function]] is an example of an equal-time correlation function where the uncorrelated reference is generally not subtracted. Other equal-time spin-spin correlation functions are shown on this page for a variety of materials and conditions.

===Equilibrium equal-position (temporal) correlation functions===
One might also be interested in the ''temporal'' evolution of microscopic variables. In other words, how the value of a microscopic variable at a given position and time, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, influences the value of the same microscopic variable at a later time, &lt;math&gt;t+\tau&lt;/math&gt; (and usually at the same position). Such temporal correlations are quantified via '''equal-position correlation functions''', &lt;math&gt;C (0,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. They are defined analogously to above equal-time correlation functions, but we now neglect spatial dependencies by setting &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;, yielding:

&lt;math&gt;C (0,\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R,t+\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R,t+\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming equilibrium (and thus time invariance of the ensemble) and averaging over all sites in the sample gives a simpler expression for the equal-position correlation function as for the equal-time correlation function:

&lt;math&gt;C (\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The above assumption may seem non-intuitive at first: how can an ensemble which is time-invariant have a non-uniform temporal correlation function? Temporal correlations remain relevant to talk about in equilibrium systems because a time-invariant, ''macroscopic'' ensemble can still have non-trivial temporal dynamics ''microscopically''. One example is in diffusion. A single-phase system at equilibrium has a homogeneous composition macroscopically. However, if one watches the microscopic movement of each atom, fluctuations in composition are constantly occurring due to the quasi-random walks taken by the individual atoms. Statistical mechanics allows one to make insightful statements about the temporal behavior of such fluctuations of equilibrium systems. This is discussed below in the section on the [[#Time evolution of correlation functions|temporal evolution of correlation functions and  Onsager's regression hypothesis]].

===Generalization beyond equilibrium correlation functions===
All of the above correlation functions have been defined in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions and spins, away from equilibrium. As such, their scalar product is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the scalar product across the entire sample. This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the radial distribution functions of glasses.

One can also define averages over states for systems perturbed slightly from equilibrium. See, for example, http://xbeams.chem.yale.edu/~batista/vaa/node56.html

==Measuring correlation functions==
Correlation functions are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations.&lt;ref name=Sethna&gt;{{cite book |first=James P. |last= Sethna |title=Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0198566778 |chapter= Chapter 10: Correlations, response, and dissipation|url= http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~sethna/StatMech/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From knowledge of elemental structure factors, one can also measure elemental pair correlation functions. See [[Radial distribution function]] for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation functions are measured with [[neutron scattering]] as opposed to x-ray scattering. Neutron scattering can also yield information on pair correlations as well. For systems composed of particles larger than about one micrometer, optical microscopy can be used to measure both equal-time and equal-position correlation functions. Optical microscopy is thus common for colloidal suspensions, especially in two dimensions.

==Time evolution of correlation functions==
In 1931, [[Lars Onsager]] proposed that the regression of microscopic thermal fluctuations at equilibrium follows the macroscopic law of relaxation of small non-equilibrium disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the ''[[Onsager Regression Hypothesis|Onsager regression hypothesis]]''. As the values of microscopic variables separated by large timescales, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, should be uncorrelated beyond what we would expect from thermodynamic equilibrium, the evolution in time of a correlation function can be viewed from a physical standpoint as the system gradually 'forgetting' the initial conditions placed upon it via the specification of some microscopic variable. There is actually an intuitive connection between the time evolution of correlation functions and the time evolution of macroscopic systems: on average, the correlation function evolves in time in the same manner as if a system was prepared in the conditions specified by the correlation function's initial value and allowed to evolve.&lt;ref name=Sethna/&gt;

==The connection between phase transitions and correlation functions==
[[File:Ferromagnetic correlation functions around Tc.svg|thumb|left|alt=The caption is very descriptive.|Equal-time correlation functions, &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of radius for a ferromagnetic spin system above, at, and below at its critical temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;. Above &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0)&lt;/math&gt; exhibits a combined exponential and power-law dependence on distance: &lt;math&gt;C (r,\tau = 0)\propto r^{-(d-2+\eta )} e^{-r/\xi (T)} &lt;/math&gt;. The power-law dependence dominates at distances short relative to the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, while the exponential dependence dominates at distances large relative to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. At &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, the correlation length diverges, &lt;math&gt;\xi (T_C)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in solely power-law behavior: &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0) \propto r^{-(d-2+\eta)}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt; is distinguished by the extreme non-locality of the spatial correlations between microscopic values of the relevant order parameter without long-range order. Below &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, the spins exhibit spontaneous ordering but finite correlation length again. Continuous order-disorder transitions can be understood as the process of the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, transitioning from being finite in the low-temperature, ordered state, to infinite at the critical point, and then again finite in a high-temperature, disordered state.]]
Continuous phase transitions, such as order-disorder transitions in metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve a transition from an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is continuous, the length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This gives rise to a power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point. This is shown in the figure in the left for the case of a ferromagnetic material, with the quantitative details listed in the section on magnetism.

==Applications==
===Magnetism===

In a [[spin (physics)|spin]] system, the equal-time correlation function is especially well-studied. It describes the canonical ensemble (thermal) average of the scalar product of the spins at two lattice points over all possible orderings:
&lt;math&gt;G (r) = \langle \mathbf{s}(R) \cdot \mathbf{s}(R+r)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s}(R) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s}(R+r) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the brackets mean the above-mentioned thermal average. Schematic plots of this function are shown for a ferromagnetic material below, at, and above its Curie temperature on the left.

Even in a magnetically disordered phase, spins at different positions are correlated, i.e., if the distance r is very small (compared to some length scale &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;), the interaction between the spins will cause them to be correlated.
The alignment that would naturally arise as a result of the interaction between spins is destroyed by thermal effects. At high temperatures exponentially-decaying correlations are observed with increasing distance, with the correlation function being given asymptotically by
:&lt;math&gt;G (r) \approx \frac{1}{r^{d-2+\eta}}\exp{\left(\frac{-r}{\xi}\right)}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where r is the distance between spins, and d is the dimension of the system, and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is a [[critical exponent]]. At high temperatures, the correlation decays to zero exponentially with the distance between the spins. The same exponential decay as a function of radial distance is also observed below &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;, but with the limit at large distances being the mean magnetization &lt;math&gt;\langle M^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

As the temperature is lowered, thermal disordering is lowered, and in a continuous phase transition the correlation length diverges, as the correlation length must transition continuously from a finite value above the phase transition, to infinite below the phase transition:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi\propto |T-T_c|^{-\nu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with another critical exponent &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

This [[power law]] correlation is responsible for the [[scaling invariance|scaling]], seen in these transitions. All  exponents mentioned are independent of temperature.
They are in fact [[universality (dynamical systems)|universal]], i.e. found to be the same in a wide variety of systems.

===Radial distribution functions===
One common correlation function is the [[radial distribution function]] which is seen often in [[statistical mechanics]]. The correlation function can be calculated in exactly solvable models (one-dimensional Bose gas, spin chains, Hubbard model) by means of [[Quantum inverse scattering method]] and [[Bethe ansatz]]. In an isotropic XY model, time and temperature correlations were evaluated by Its, Korepin, Izergin &amp; Slavnov.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Its, V.e. Korepin, A.G. Izergin &amp; N.A. Slavnov (2009) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4751 Temperature Correlation of Quantum Spins] from [[arxiv.org]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Higher order correlation functions====
Higher-order correlation functions involve multiple reference points, and are defined through a generalization of the above correlation function by taking the expected value of the product of more than two random variables:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n) = \langle X_{i_1}(s_1) X_{i_2}(s_2) \cdots X_{i_n}(s_n)\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

However, such higher order correlation functions are relatively difficult to interpret and measure. For example, in order to measure the higher-order analogues of pair distribution functions, coherent x-ray sources are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

Can It Be Taught?] March 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While musicality deals with finding a particular matching pair of dance and music that fit each other in various respects, dance theory is a broad term encompassing the [[Dance_history|origins]], [[List of dance style categories|styles]], [[genre]], [[Footwork (dance)|footwork]], [[Art|artistic expression]], etc. of dance.

Three broad categories of dance theory, as you may find them described in universities or dance institutes, are philosophy (concerning the aesthetic meanings behind dance, or [[semiotics]]), choreology (movement analysis and description), sociology (regarding the role of dance in society and culture).&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary-Dance.org [http://www.contemporary-dance.org/dance-theory.html Dance Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance theory deals with [[anatomical]] movements (such as foot-work, etc.), as well as [[Connection (dance)|partner interactions]], and their associations to each other and to music as art. It explores the communicative, physical, mental, emotional, and artistic aspects of dance as a medium of human expression and interaction.  In doing so the various nuances between the dance genres and styles are analyzed with respect to their [[social setting]]s and [[culture]]s.

As dance is a ubiquitous element of culture, dance theory attempts to determine the instinctual nature of dance, and what makes various movements appear natural or forced.

it is possible through understanding including the writing and drawing of dances within a sphere to understand that all dance is based on natural body movements that is the moving of joints limbs and legs and fingers, dance theory is based on these founding principles that is the sphere and lines of the body to derive and show and demonstrate how dance is done which movements to do by which movement at which speed so hypothetically it is possible to draw and work out a dance by using sphere lines and arrows etc to build up a dance and a routine starting with examples and extenuating etc many dance books state how this is done.

[[File:Professor E.A. Westermarck, c1930s.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Westermarck]]
'''Edvard Alexander Westermarck''' (20 November 1862 &amp;ndash; 3 September 1939) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]]. Among other subjects, he studied [[exogamy]] and the [[incest taboo]].

The phenomenon of reverse sexual imprinting is when two people live in close domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one, and both become desensitised to sexual attraction, now known as the [[Westermarck effect]], was first formally described by him in his book ''[[The History of Human Marriage]]'' (1891). 

He has been described as "first [[Darwinian]] sociologist" or "the first [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]]".&lt;ref name=sanderson&gt;Sanderson, SK. "REFORMING THEORETICAL WORK IN SOCIOLOGY: A DETAILED REPLY TO MY CRITICS"&lt;/ref&gt; 

He helped found academic [[sociology]] in the United Kingdom, becoming the first professor of sociology (with [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]) in 1907 in the [[University of London]]. Other chairs he held were in Helsinki and Turku. 

A radical free thinker for his time, he critiqued Christian institutions and Christian ideas on the grounds that they lacked foundation. 

In the UK, his name is often spelled '''Edward'''. His sister, [[Helena Westermarck]], was a writer and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Petteys | first = Chris | title = Dictionary of women artists : an international dictionary of women artists born before 1900 | publisher = G.K.

{{Accounting}}
'''Forensic accounting''', '''forensic accountancy''' or '''financial forensics''' is the specialty practice area of [[accounting]] that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. "[[Forensic science|Forensic]]" means "suitable for use in a court of law", and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work. Forensic accountants, also referred to as forensic auditors or investigative auditors, often have to give expert evidence at the eventual trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Within these groups, there may be further sub-specializations: some forensic accountants may, for example, just specialize in [[insurance]] [[claim (legal)|claims]], [[personal injury]] claims, [[fraud]], [[Money Laundering|anti-money-laundering]], [[construction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Forensic accounting is defined as "the application of investigative and analytical skills for the purpose of resolving financial issues in a manner that meets standards required by courts of law. Forensic accountants apply special skills in accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, certain areas of the law, research and investigative skills to collect, analyze and evaluate evidential matter and to interpret and communicate findings."&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hopwood, J.J. Leiner &amp; G.R. Young, ''Forensic Accounting'', McGraw-Hill Irwin (2008), as quoted by Stephen Pedneault, Frank Rudewicz, Michael Sheetz &amp; Howard Silverstone, ''Forensic Accounting and Fraud Investigation'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (4th ed. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial forensic engagements may fall into several categories.  For example:
* [[Damages|Economic damages]] calculations, whether suffered through [[tort]] or [[breach of contract]];
* Post-acquisition disputes such as [[earnout]]s or breaches of [[warranty|warranties]];
* [[Bankruptcy]], [[insolvency]], and [[Corporate action|reorganization]];
* [[Securities fraud]];
* [[Tax fraud]];
* [[Money laundering]];
* [[Business valuation]]; and
* [[Computer forensics]]/[[Electronic discovery|e-discovery]].
Forensic accountants often assist in professional [[negligence]] claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals.  Forensic accountants are also engaged in [[marital and family law]] of analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support and equitable distribution.

Engagements relating to criminal matters typically arise in the aftermath of fraud. They frequently involve the assessment of accounting systems and accounts presentation—in essence assessing if the numbers reflect reality.

Some forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud.  The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) data collection, (b) data preparation, (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting.  For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Forensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime and in relation to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or [[money laundering]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], relevant legislation is contained in the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]]. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; [[Certified Forensic Accounting Professional]] [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England &amp; Wales) granted by the [[Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales]] (FACB), [[Certified Fraud Examiner]]s (CFE - US / International), [[Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD)]] by [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPA - US) with [[AICPA]]'s [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, [[Chartered Accountant]]s (CA - Canada), [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA - Canada), [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s (CPA - Canada)), [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|Chartered Certified Accountant]]s (CCA - UK), or [[Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals]] (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/forensic-auditor-courses-catching-up-in-india-114042301428_1.html|title=Forensic Auditor Courses catching up in India |publisher=business-standard.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC)''' program from the '''American Board of Forensic Accounting''' assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993. 

In 2016, the Forensic Auditors Certification Board (FACB) of England and Wales was established by the major forensic auditing and accounting bodies from across the world with its registered address in London. FACB is a professional bodies membership body comprising the International Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (IICFA) of USA, Institute of Forensic Auditors of Zimbabwe (IFA), Institute of Forensic Accountants of Pakistan (IFAP), Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (ICFA) of USA and Canada and the Institute of Forensic Accountants of Nigeria (IFA). FACB plays several roles and one the roles is standardization of the examination and certification of forensic auditors globally. Forensic auditors and accountants sit for one examination that is set by FACB and upon passing and meeting all the professional requirements, are awarded the credential, Certified Forensic Auditor (CFA) or the Registered Forensic Auditor (RFA) for practitioners who intend to go into public practice. All certification is renewed on an annual basis. Apart from practitioners certification, FACB is an oversight body which accredits prospective member organization before admission as part of quality checks. Persons with the FACB credential can practice as forensic auditors on a global scale.

Large accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big4accountingfirms.org/forensic-accounting-firms/|title=Service of Forensic Accountants |publisher=big4accountingfirms.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors, but their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand. That is necessary because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors move on checklists that may not surface the evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for. The fieldwork may carry out legal risks if internal auditing checklists are employed instead asking to a forensic accountant and may result serious consultant malpractice risks.

Forensic accountants utilize an understanding of [[Economics|economic theories]], [[business information]], [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, [[data management]] &amp; [[electronic discovery]], [[data analysis techniques for fraud detection]], [[evidence]] gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work. Forensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, [[fraud deterrence]] engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.

A December 10,2014 Business Insider article explains Benford's Law as follows: in most naturally occurring datasets, the first digit of a number is 1, about 30% of the time, 2 about 18% of the time and 9 only about 5% of the time. So, one can identify the probable area of fraud by looking at the occurrences of the first digit in a given dataset.

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences''' recognizes excellence in the execution of [[operations research]] on the organizational level.

==About==
The award is presented annually by the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] (INFORMS).

The international competition pits six teams from industry, government, healthcare, and the non-profit sectors. The competition takes place at the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference and concludes with the announcement of the winner at a gala dinner at the conference. It began in 1971 as the TIMS Prize and was named for Franz Edelman, the operations research director of [[RCA]], shortly after his death in 1982. It carries a cash award of $10,000. Since its inception, nearly $250 billion in benefits have been tabulated among Franz Edelman Award finalist teams. Following the competition, INFORMS publishes papers by the Edelman finalists in the January issue of the INFORMS journal [[Interfaces (journal)|''Interfaces'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubsonline.informs.org/loi/inte Interfaces, All Volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Greco-Buddhism''', or '''Graeco-Buddhism''', is the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed between the 4th century BC and the 5th century AD in [[Bactria]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[satraps]] were then conquered by the [[Mauryan Empire]], under the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The Mauryan [[Emperor Ashoka]] would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Greco-Buddhism continued to flourish under the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], [[Indo-Greek Kingdoms]], and [[Kushan Empire]]. Buddhism was adopted in Central and Northeastern [[Asia]] from the 1st century AD, ultimately spreading to [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Siberia]], and [[Vietnam]].

The introduction of [[Hellenistic Greece]] started when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and further regions of [[Central Asia]] in 334 BC. Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.

Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or "successors" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.

The [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare
30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper&lt;/ref&gt; As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the [[Shunga Empire]], and of the revolt of [[Bactria]] in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] Kingdom (250–125&amp;nbsp;BC). The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– AD&amp;nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st–3rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.

[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].

==Cultural interaction==
{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}
The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.

===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325&amp;nbsp;BC)===
[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|"Victory coin" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&amp;nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.&lt;br/&gt;Silver. [[British Museum]].]]
When Alexander invaded [[Bactria]] and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under [[Śramaṇa|Sramanic]] influence, likely Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]]. According to a legend preserved in the [[Pali Canon]], two [[merchant]] brothers from [[Kamsabhoga]] in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against [[King Porus]] of [[Pauravas]] in the Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.

===Mauryan empire (322–183&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist monasticism}}
The Indian emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], reconquered around 322&amp;nbsp;BC the northwest Indian territory that had been lost to [[Alexander the Great]]. However, contacts were kept with his Greco-Iranian neighbours in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Emperor [[Seleucus I Nicator]] came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty,&lt;ref&gt;"The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of Antigonus and some afterward." [[Appian]] ''History of Rome'', The Syrian Wars [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html 55]&lt;/ref&gt; and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], resided at the Mauryan court.

[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hellenistic]] [[Pataliputra capital]], discovered in [[Pataliputra]], capital of the [[Maurya Empire]], dated to the 3rd century BC.]]
Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals ([[ahimsa]]), and general precepts regulating the life of lay people.

According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of the Greek edicts: {{cite book|title=Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXdfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|date=2 December 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-25530-2|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], the official language of the [[Achaemenids]], he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the [[Hellenistic period]]:

Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}
Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pali]] sources as leading Greek ("[[Yona]]") Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020052522/http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html|title=Chapter XII|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), founding the eponymous [[Dharmaguptaka]] school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=62|title=Abstract Sujato: Sects &amp; Sectarianism|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] ({{circa|300}}–145&amp;nbsp;BC) was located at the doorstep of [[India]].]]
Alexander had established in Bactria several cities ([[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Bagram]]) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the [[Maurya Empire]], such as the historian [[Megasthenes]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya]], and later [[Deimachus]] under his son [[Bindusara]], who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:&lt;ref&gt;Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Megasthenes makes a different division of the philosophers, saying that they are of two kinds, one of which he calls the [[Brahman|Brachmanes]], and the other the [[Sramana|Sarmanes]]..." [[Strabo]] XV. 1. 58-60&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"/&gt;}}
The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of [[Ai-Khanoum]]. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the [[Shunga Empire]] around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], under which Buddhism was able to flourish.

===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;10)===
[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|350px|Greek Gods and the "Wheel of the Law" or [[Dharmachakra]]: '''Left:''' [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], who hands a victory [[wreath]] over a Dharmachakra (coin of [[Menander II]]). '''Right:''' Divinity wearing [[chlamys]] and [[petasus]] pushing a Dharmachakra, with legend "He who sets in motion the Wheel of the Law" ([[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]]).]]
{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}
The Greco-Bactrians conquered parts of [[North India]] from 180&amp;nbsp;BC, whence they are known as the Indo-Greeks. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until AD&amp;nbsp;10.

Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]] (185–73&amp;nbsp;BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. [[Zarmanochegas]] was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] traveled to [[Antioch]] and [[Athens]] while [[Augustus]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coinage====
The coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 160–135&amp;nbsp;BC), found from [[Afghanistan]] to central India, bear the inscription "Saviour King Menander" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[Strato I]], [[Heliokles II]], [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Menander II]] and [[Archebius]] display on their coins the title "Maharajasa Dharmika" (lit. "King of the Dharma") in [[Prakrit]] written in [[Kharoshthi]].

Some of the coins of Menander I and [[Menander II]] incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. According to the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]], at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist [[arhat]],&lt;ref&gt;Extract of the [[Milinda Panha]]: "And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to [[Arhat|Arahatship]]!" ([[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]], Translation by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]], 1890)&lt;/ref&gt; a fact also echoed by [[Plutarch]], who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch on Menander: "But when one Menander, who had reigned graciously over the Bactrians, died afterwards in the camp, the cities indeed by common consent celebrated his funerals; but coming to a contest about his relics, they were difficultly at last brought to this agreement, that his ashes being distributed, everyone should carry away an equal share, and they should all erect monuments to him." (Plutarch, "Political Precepts" Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6) p147–148 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090138/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Plutarch0206/Morals/0062-05_Bk.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenanderChakra.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A coin of [[Menander I]] (r.160–135 BC) with a [[dharmacakra]] and a palm.]]

The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of [[Antialcidas]] and [[Menander II]], where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.

Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as [[Amyntas Nikator]], [[Nicias (Indo-Greek king)|Nicias]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Hermaeus]], [[Hippostratos]] and [[Menander II]], depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka [[mudra]] (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching.

====Cities====
According to [[Ptolemy]], Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern [[India]]. Menander established his capital in [[Sagala]] (modern [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]) one of the centers of the blossoming [[Buddhist culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milinda Panha]], Chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; A large Greek city built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of [[Sirkap]] near [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], where Buddhist [[stupa]]s were standing side-by-side with [[Hindu]] and [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temples]], indicating religious tolerance and syncretism.

====Scriptures====
Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the ''[[Milinda Pañha]]'' or "Questions of Menander", a Pali-language discourse in the [[Platonism|Platonic style]] held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk [[Nagasena]].

[[File:Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba.jpg|thumb|According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]], was dedicated by a 30,000-strong [[Yona]] delegation from [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]] around 130&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', chapter 29, records that during Menander's reign, a Greek ''thera'' (elder monk) named ''[[Mahadharmaraksita]]'' led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alexandria" (possibly [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of today's [[Kabul]] in Afghanistan), to [[Sri Lanka]] for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander's territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it.&lt;ref name="McEvilley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas  McEvilley|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbjelOMYyN8C&amp;pg=PT558|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|isbn=978-1-58115-933-2|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek [[meridarch]] (civil governor of a province) named [[Theodorus (meridarch)|Theodorus]], describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined [[śarīra|relics of the Buddha]]. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="Tarn2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarn|first=William Woodthorpe|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00941-6|page=391|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and [[Kanishka the Great]].

Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the [[Mahayana]] figure of "[[Avalokiteśvara|Lokesvara]]raja Buddha" ({{lang|grc|λωγοασφαροραζοβοδδο}}). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sims-Williams, "A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The [[Kushan Empire]], one of the five tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], settled in [[Bactria]] around 125&amp;nbsp;BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around AD&amp;nbsp;1. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their [[coin]]s and their adoption of the [[Greek alphabet]].

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, [[amphora]]s, wine and music. Detail from [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.]]
The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the [[Fourth Buddhist council]] around 100 in [[Kashmir]] in order to redact the [[Sarvastivada#Canon|Sarvastivadin canon]]. Some of Kanishka's coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word "Boddo" in Greek script.

Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] translated into [[Sanskrit]], "a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kanishka casket]], dated to the first year of Kanishka's reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's stupas ([[cetiya]]), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date.

==Philosophical influences==
Several philosophers, including [[Pyrrho]], [[Anaxarchus]] and [[Onesicritus]], are said to have accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian ascetics, generally described as [[Gymnosophists]] ("naked philosophers").

Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], the first Western school of [[skepticism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.&lt;ref&gt;"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], is said by [[Strabo]] to have learnt in India the following precepts: "That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief".&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"&gt;Strabo, XV.I.65: {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23119 |title=Strabo XV.1 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where [[Magas of Cyrene]] ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influences==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Numerous works of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as [[Gandhara]]. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of [[Western Asia]]tic or Hellenistic origin.

===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha===
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|upright|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century AD, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district]], [[India]].]]
Although there is still some debate, the first [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was "[[aniconism|aniconic]]": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).

This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.&lt;ref&gt;"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time". Also "''Hinayanis'' opposed image worship of the Master due to canonical restrictions".   R.C. Sharma, in "The Art of Mathura, India", Tokyo National Museum 2002, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of "their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;Linssen, "[[Zen]] Living"&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=June 2014}} In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop [[syncretic]] divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is [[Serapis]], introduced by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] in [[Egypt]], who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

}}
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&amp;nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]]. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the [[Pāli canon]]; we find the same description in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience:
{{quote|One of the distinguishing features of the Gandharan school of art that emerged in north-west India is that it has been clearly influenced by the naturalism of the Classical Greek style. Thus, while these images still convey the inner peace that results from putting the Buddha's doctrine into practice, they also give us an impression of people who walked and talked, etc. and slept much as we do. I feel this is very important. These figures are inspiring because they do not only depict the goal, but also the sense that people like us can achieve it if we try.|[[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;[[14th Dalai Lama]], foreword to "Echoes of Alexander the Great", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements.

===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon===

Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, [[Heracles]] with a lion-skin, the protector deity of [[Demetrius I of Bactria]], "served as an artistic model for [[Vajrapani]], a protector of the Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; (See&lt;ref&gt;Images of the Herakles-influenced Vajrapani: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131216205740/http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image 1], [http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg Image 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040313155937/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg |date=2004-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Japan]], this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular [[Nio|Niō]] guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese [[Fūjin]], inspired from the Greek divinity [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]], or the mother deity [[Hariti]] inspired by [[Tyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsumi Tanabe, ''Alexander the Great: East-West Cultural Contact from Greece to Japan'' (Tokyo: NHK Puromōshon and Tokyo National Museum, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, forms such as [[garland]]-bearing [[cherub]]s, [[vine]] [[scroll]]s, and such semi-human creatures as the [[centaur]] and [[Triton (mythology)|triton]], are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court.

===Gandharan proselytism in the East===

Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "Milinda"),  [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was "a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: [[Yona]], lit. [[Ionia]]n) Buddhist head monk," according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&amp;nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]]. [[Dharmaraksita]] ([[Sanskrit]]), or Dhammarakkhita ([[Pāli|Pali]]) ([[translation]]: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "[[Yona]]", lit. "[[Ionia]]n") in the [[Mahavamsa]], and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, [[Menander I]] was famously converted to Buddhism by [[Nagasena]], who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Dharmaraksita]]. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an [[arhat]] under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I ([[Pāli|Pali]] "Milinda") with the monk [[Nagasena]] comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the [[Milinda Panha]].

Buddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] in Afghanistan, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist [[Kushan]] monks such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] ({{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;178}}) travelled to the Chinese capital of [[Loyang]], where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz|Foltz, Richard]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 46 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]] frescos from the [[Tarim Basin]]. In legend too [[Bodhidharma]], the founder of [[Chán]]-Buddhism, which later became [[Zen]], and the legendary originator of the physical training of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], is described as a Buddhist monk from [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547).&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" ({{zh|c=碧眼胡|p=Bìyǎn hú|labels=no}}) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 485 AD, according to the 7th century Chinese historic treatise [[Liang Shu]], five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of [[Fusang]] ("The country of the extreme East" beyond the sea, probably eastern [[Japan]]), where they introduced Buddhism:

{{quote|"[[Fusang]] is located to the east of China, 20,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' [1,500&amp;nbsp;km] east of the state of ''Da Han'' (itself east of the state of ''Wa'' in modern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]). (...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the [[Song dynasty]] [AD&amp;nbsp;485], five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result the customs of Fusang changed." (Chinese: "{{lang|zh|扶桑在大漢國東二萬餘里,地在中國之東(...)其俗舊無佛法,宋大明二年,罽賓國嘗有比丘五人游行至其國,流通佛法,經像,教令出家,風 俗遂改.}}")}}

Two half-brothers from [[Gandhara]], [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century), created the [[Yogacara]] or "Mind-only" school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy.

===Greco-Buddhism in the West===
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka. This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the [[Silk Road]] is confirmed by the Roman craze for [[silk]] from the 1st century BC to the point that the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: [[Strabo]] (64/63&amp;nbsp;BC – {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;24}}), [[Seneca the Younger]] ({{circa|3&amp;nbsp;BC}} – AD&amp;nbsp;65), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD&amp;nbsp;23–79). The aforementioned Strabo and [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|45}}–125) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king [[Milinda|Menander]], confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.

[[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] while Augustus (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death.&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"/&gt; His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. [[Plutarch]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;120) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of [[Calanus of India]] ([[Kalanos]]) witnessed by Alexander writes: "The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you 'the Indian's Monument,'"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. 'Life of Alexander' in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans. (trans John Dryden and revised Arthur Hugh Clough) The Modern Library (Random House Inc). New York.p850&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Zarmanochegas' tomb in Roman Athens.

Another century later the Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died 215) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): "The Indian [[gymnosophists]] are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called "Hylobii" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of [[Buddha]] (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours."&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Clement of Alexandria Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria in Egypt, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria at this time is important, since "It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Linssen]], ''Zen living''&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word "[[Theravada|Theravāda]],"&lt;ref&gt;According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy&lt;/ref&gt; a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;"Zen living", [[Robert Linssen]]{{Page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have been descendants of [[Asoka]]'s emissaries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;"The Original Jesus" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Christianity===
{{Main|Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist influences on Christianity}}
[[File:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|Queen Māyā's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2nd–3rd century AD.]]

Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.

One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.&lt;ref&gt;"Certain Indian notions may have made their way westward into the budding Christianity of the Mediterranean world through the channels of the Greek diaspora."  Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Scholars have often considered the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity. They have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus" (Bentley, ''Old World Encounters'').}}

The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century AD) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says "was born from the side of a virgin,"&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential early Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV).&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; The legend of Christian saints [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] draws on the life of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43928">'''[[Optics]]''' began with the development of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Mesopotamia]]ns, followed by theories on light and [[Visual perception|vision]] developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], and the development of [[geometrical optics]] in the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The word ''[[optics]]'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''τα ὀπτικά'' meaning "appearance, look".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology|year=1996|author=T. F. Hoad|isbn=0-19-283098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in [[early modern Europe]], where [[Diffraction|diffractive optics]] began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as "classical optics". The term "modern optics" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as [[Physical optics|wave optics]] and [[quantum optics]].

==Early history==

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the [[Nimrud lens|Nimrud / Layard lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 |title=The Nimrud lens / the Layard lens |publisher=The British Museum |work=Collection database |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses. However, glass lenses were not thought of until the [[Middle Ages]].

Some lenses fixed in ancient Egyptian statues are much older than those mentioned above. There is some doubt as to whether or not they qualify as lenses, but they are undoubtedly glass and served at least ornamental purposes. The statues appear to be anatomically correct schematic eyes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In [[Science and technology in ancient India|ancient India]], the philosophical schools of [[Samkhya]] and [[Vaisheshika]], from around the 6th&amp;ndash;5th century BC, developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements.

In contrast, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic [[atom]]s are those of earth (''prthivı''), water (''apas''), fire (''tejas''), and air (''vayu''), that should not be confused with the ordinary meaning of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms. Around the first century BC, the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as "the seven rays of the sun".

In the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sarton |first=G |year=1993 |title=Ancient science through the golden age of Greece |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&amp;pg=PA248 |page=248 |publisher=[[Courier Dover]] |isbn=978-0-486-27495-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] observed that "things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Ptolemy]].

In 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek [[atomism|atomists]], wrote:

{{quote|The light and heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.|Lucretius|''On the nature of the Universe''{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}}}

Despite being similar to later particle theories of light, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted and light was still theorized as emanating from the eye.

In his ''Catoptrica'', [[Hero of Alexandria]] showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.

In the second century [[Claudius Ptolemy]],  in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' undertook studies of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]].  He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, and his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the [[angle of refraction]] is proportional to the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.E.R. | authorlink = G.

The Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dignāga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of [[atomism]] that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, similar to the modern concept of [[photon]]s, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles.

===Geometrical optics===
{{See also|Geometrical optics|Ray (optics)}}

The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer [[Euclid]] (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms.

# Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object.
# Those lines falling upon an object form a cone.
# Those things upon which the lines fall are seen.
# Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger.
# Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher.
# Right and left rays appear right and left.
# Things seen within several angles appear clearer.

Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance.

Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. AD 10–70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics).  Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This has come to be known as [[Emission theory (vision)|''emission theory'']].&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2015|title=Two Millennia of Light: The Long Path to Maxwell’s Waves|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=54–56+60|doi=10.1109/MIE.2015.2421754|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer.  On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror.  Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror.

Like Hero, [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' (preserved only in the form of a Latin translation of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.  Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density.  He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.&lt;ref&gt;D.

Smith, Ptolemy's search for a law of refraction: a case-study in the classical methodology of 'saving the appearances' and its limitations, ''Arch. Hist. Exact Sci''. 26 (1982), 221-240; Ptolemy's procedure is reported in the fifth chapter of his ''Optics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His tabulated results have been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the outliers are distorted to represent Ptolemy's ''a priori'' model of the nature of refraction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==In the Islamic world==
[[File:Ibn Sahl manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|Reproduction of a page of [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as [[Snell's law]].]]

[[Al-Kindi]] (c. 801–873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].  In a work known in the west as ''De radiis stellarum'', al-Kindi developed a theory "that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Theorem_of_al-Haitham.JPG|thumb|The [[Circle#Theorems|theorem of Ibn Haytham]]]] This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David C.|last=Lindberg|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=62|issue=4|date=Winter 1971|pages=469–489 [471]|doi=10.1086/350790|title=Alkindi's Critique of Euclid's Theory of Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on [[Optics (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Optics'']]. His treatise  ''Fī al-'āla al-muḥriqa'' "On the burning instruments" was recontructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Rashed, R., ''Géométrie et dioptrique au Xe siècle: Ibn Sahl, al-Quhi et Ibn al-Haytham.'' Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1993
&lt;/ref&gt; The work is concerned with how [[curved mirror]]s and [[lens (optics)|lens]]es bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of [[refraction]] mathematically equivalent to [[Snell's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashed | first1 = R. | year = 1990 | title = A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses | url = | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 464–91 | doi=10.1086/355456}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in as ''Alhacen'' or ''Alhazen'' in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's ''Optics''. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindberg | first1 = D. C. | year = 1967 | title = Alhazen's Theory of Vision and its Reception in the West | url = | journal = Isis | volume = 58 | issue = | page = 322 | doi=10.1086/350266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn al-Haytham's key achievement was twofold: first, to insist, against the opinion of Ptolemy, that vision occurred because of rays entering the eye; the second was to define the physical nature of the rays discussed by earlier geometrical optical writers, considering them as the forms of light and color.&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air." – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''', as cited by Samuel Sambursky (1974), ''Physical thought from the Pre-socratics to the quantum physicists'' &lt;/ref&gt;  
He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics.  He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al Manazir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), translated into [[Latin]] as the ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectiva'', which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 58-86; [[Nader El-Bizri]] 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189–218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;

[[Avicenna]] (980-1037) agreed with Alhazen that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as he "observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the [[speed of sound]].&lt;ref name=Biruni&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh]], who lived in [[Al-Andalus]] during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as ''Liber de crepisculis'', which was mistakenly attributed to [[Alhazen]]. This was a "short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning [[twilight]] and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays." Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Authorship of the Liber de crepusculis, an Eleventh-Century Work on Atmospheric Refraction|first=A.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236–1311) and his student [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. Al-Fārisī published his findings in his ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name="Gazi"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hüseyin Gazi |last=Topdemir |title=Kamal Al-Din Al-Farisi's Explanation of the Rainbow |journal=Humanity &amp; Social Sciences Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 [83] |year=2007 |url=http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002144913/http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medieval Europe==

The English bishop, [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253), wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval [[university]] and the recovery of the works of Aristotle.  Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new [[Aristotelianism]], hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings.  He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an [[epistemology]] of light, a [[metaphysics]] or [[cosmogony]] of light, an [[etiology]] or [[physics]] of light, and a [[theology]] of light.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval "big bang" theory.  Both his biblical commentary, the ''Hexaemeron'' (1230 x 35), and his scientific ''On Light'' (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:3, "God said, let there be light", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Southern, ''Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 136-9, 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optics from Roger Bacon's De multiplicatone specierum.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, ''De multiplicatione specierum'')]]

His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his ''On Lines, Angles, and Figures'' where he asserts that "a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient" and in ''On the Nature of Places'' where he notes that "every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures."&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1214–1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light.  In his optical writings (the ''Perspectiva'', the ''De multiplicatione specierum'', and the ''De speculis comburentibus'') he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhacen]], [[Aristotle]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Kindi]], [[Ptolemy]], Tideus, and [[Constantine the African]].  Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen.  But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (''species'') by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those ''species''.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, "Roger Bacon on Light, Vision, and the Universal Emanation of Force", pp. 243-275 in Jeremiah Hackett, ed., ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'', (Leiden: Brill, 1997), pp. 245-250; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 107-18; ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1992, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that Bacon's optical use of the term "''species''" differs significantly from the [[Species#Historical development of the species concept|genus / species]] categories found in Aristotelian philosophy.

Several later works, including the influential ''A Moral Treatise on the Eye'' (Latin: ''Tractatus Moralis de Oculo'') by [[Peter of Limoges]] (1240–1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World: Optics, Theology and Religious Life|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|author=Dallas G. Denery II|page=75-80|isbn=9781139443814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English Franciscan, [[John Pecham]] (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on Optics of the Middle Ages, the ''Perspectiva communis''.  His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color.  Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''John Pecham and the Science of Optics:'' Perspectiva communis, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1970), pp. 12-32; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 116-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his predecessors, [[Witelo]] (c. 1230–1280 x 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the ''Perspectiva''.  His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of ''species'', although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas.  Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 118-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodoric of Freiberg]] (ca. 1250–ca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Gazi" /&gt; as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311) and his student Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1260–1320) mentioned above.

==Renaissance and Early Modern==

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (''The Optical Part of Astronomy''). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies.  ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp 142–146&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willebrord Snellius]] (1580–1626) found the mathematical law of [[refraction]], now known as [[Snell's law]], in 1621. Subsequently, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tipler|first=P. A. and G. Mosca|year=2004|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|location= |publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=0-7167-4389-2|page= 1068|oclc=51095685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently discovered the [[law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwquAJtW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the ''Opera reliqua'' (also known as ''Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma'') and the ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] could decompose [[White|white light]] into a [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of colours, and that a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Isaac Newton's early life and achievements#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]]. From this work he concluded that any refracting [[telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]]) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes ''On Colour'', which he later expanded into his ''Opticks''. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or ''corpuscles'' and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [[wave]]s to explain the [[diffraction]] of light (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]] and the idea of [[wave-particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posited]] the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dobbs |first=J.T. |date=December 1982 |title=Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter |journal=Isis |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=523 |doi=10.1086/353114}} quoting ''Opticks''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffractive optics===
[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction, which he presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1803]]

The effects of [[diffraction]] of light were carefully observed and characterized by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who also coined the term ''diffraction'', from the Latin ''diffringere'', 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Memoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts | author = Jean Louis Aubert | publisher = Impr. de S.

[[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638&amp;ndash;1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first [[diffraction grating]]. In 1803 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his [[Young's Double Slit Interferometer|double slit interferometer]]. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.

==Lenses and lensmaking==
{{See also|Timeline of telescope technology}}

The earliest known [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] were made from polished [[crystal]], often [[quartz]], and have been dated as early as 750&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Assyria]]n lenses such as the Layard / [[Nimrud lens]].&lt;ref name=BM_Nimrud/&gt; There are many similar lenses from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Babylon]]. The [[ancient Roman]]s and Greeks filled glass [[sphere]]s with water to make lenses.

The earliest historical reference to [[magnification]] dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] in the 5th century BC, which depict "simple glass meniscal [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]". The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when [[Seneca the Younger]], a tutor of Emperor [[Nero]], wrote: "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water".&lt;ref name=Kriss&gt;{{citation|last1=Kriss|first1=Timothy C.|last2=Kriss|first2=Vesna Martich|title=History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=42|issue=4|pages=899–907|date=April 1998|doi=10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116|pmid=9574655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the [[gladiator|gladiatorial games]] using an [[emerald]] as a corrective lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+37.16 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]], [[Lens (optics)|concave lenses]], and [[magnifying glass]]es in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref name="Kriss"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{Harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{Harv|Elliott|1966}}{{rp|Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bacon]] used parts of glass spheres as [[magnifying glass]]es and recommended them to be used to help people read. Roger Bacon got his inspiration from [[Alhacen]] in the 11th century. He discovered that light reflects from objects rather than emanating from them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Between the 11th and 13th century "[[reading stone]]s" were invented. Often used by [[monk]]s to assist in [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] manuscripts, these were primitive [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|plano-convex lenses]] initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses [[magnification|magnified]] more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses were made, although it is unclear who the inventor was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|date=2007-01-01|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=|isbn=9780871692597|location=|pages=4–6|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known working telescopes were the [[refracting telescope]]s that appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: [[Hans Lippershey]] applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]] two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] greatly improved upon these designs the following year.

== Quantum optics ==
{{Main|Quantum optics}}

Light is made up of particles called [[photons]] and hence inherently is quantized.  Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from [[Max Planck]] in 1899 when he correctly modelled [[blackbody radiation]] by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light.&lt;ref name="Cropper2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. Cropper|title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231–236}} In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of the [[photoelectric effect]]. It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, [[Niels Bohr]] showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and [[matter]] following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of [[atom physics]] and [[quantum electronics]].

This changed with the invention of the [[maser]] in 1953 and the [[laser]] in 1960. [[Laser science]]—research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name ''quantum optics'' became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in [[quantum field theory]], [[George Sudarshan]], [[Roy J. Glauber]], and [[Leonard Mandel]] applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the [[statistical mechanics|statistics]] of light (see [[degree of coherence]]). This led to the introduction of the [[coherent state]] as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, [[H. Jeff Kimble|Kimble]] et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time.  Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezed light]], was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser pulses—created by [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("[[ultrafast]]") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. [[Raman spectroscopy]]) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an [[optical trap]] or [[optical tweezers]] by laser beam. This, along with [[Doppler cooling]] was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated [[Bose–Einstein condensation]].

Other remarkable results are the [[Bell test experiments|demonstration of quantum entanglement]], [[quantum teleportation]], and (recently, in 1995) [[quantum logic gate]]s. The latter are of much interest in [[quantum information theory]], a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical [[computer science]].

Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include [[parametric down-conversion]], [[Optical parametric oscillator|parametric oscillation]], even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for [[quantum information]], manipulation of single atoms, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called [[atom optics]]), and much more.

In [[biology]] and [[botany]], '''indeterminate growth''' is growth that is not terminated in contrast to '''determinate growth''' that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces [[flower]]s and [[fruit]] until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to [[tomato]] varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies.

==Inflorescences==
In reference to an [[inflorescence]] (a shoot specialised for bearing flowers, and bearing no leaves other than [[bract]]s), an indeterminate type (such as a [[raceme]]) is one in which the first flowers to develop and open are from the buds at the base, followed progressively by buds nearer to the growing tip. The growth of the shoot is not impeded by the opening of the early flowers or development of fruits and its appearance is of growing, producing, and maturing flowers and fruit indefinitely. In practice the continued growth of the terminal end necessarily peters out sooner or later, though without producing any definite terminal flower, and in some species it may stop growing before any of the buds have opened. 

Not all plants produce indeterminate inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates the development of new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a '''determinate'' inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|terminal flower]] blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side buds develop lower down. One type of example is [[Dianthus]] another type is exemplified by [[Allium]] and yet others by [[Daucus]].

==Animals==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In zoology, indeterminate growth refers to the condition where animals grow rapidly when young, and continue to grow after reaching adulthood although at a slower pace.&lt;ref name="pmid11675785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West GB, Brown JH, Enquist BJ | title = A general model for ontogenetic growth | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6856 | pages = 628–31 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11675785 | doi = 10.1038/35098076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and many molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Optimal allocation of resources explains interspecific life-history patterns in animals with indeterminate growth | author=Jan Kozłowski | journal=Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17160">{{canon law}}Regarding the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], canonists provide and obey rules for the '''interpretation''' and acceptation of words, in order that [[legislation]] is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined.

==Authentic interpretation==
{{see also|Regulae Juris}}
An "authentic interpretation" is an official and authoritative interpretation of a [[statute]] issued by the [[legislator]] of the statute. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] an authentic interpretation has the [[force of law]].

Besides the [[Supreme Pontiff]] (Pope), who has plenary legislative power, several other authorities in the [[Catholic Church]] have various grades of legislative power. Primary examples are diocesan [[bishops]] and their equivalents, [[episcopal conference]]s, and [[synod|particular council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Canon L. Socy. Gr. Brit. &amp; Ir., ''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit: A Practical Guide to the Code of Canon Law'' ¶ 46, at 15, 15 n. 2 (Gerard Sheehy et al. eds., Liturgical Press 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these [[legislator]]s can issue authentic interpretations of their own&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Iuris Canonici]]'' (''CIC''), Canon 16, §1; ''[[Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium]]'' (''CCEO''), Canon 1498.&lt;/ref&gt; and their predecessors' laws&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit'', ¶ 46, at 15 (Rev. Augustine Mendonça, JCD).&lt;/ref&gt;. Authentic interpretations supersede even administrative decisions of [[ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]] and judgments of [[ecclesiastical courts]], because neither of these acts have the [[force of law]] which authentic interpretations have.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §3; ''CCEO'', Canon 1498, §3.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of an authentic interpretation is contingent on the extent of the interpretation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An authentic interpretation which is presented by way of a law has the same force as the law itself, and must be promulgated. If it simply declares the words which are certain in themselves, it has retroactive force. If it restricts or extends a law or explains a doubtful one, it is not retroactive.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §2, ''translated in'' ''The Canon Law Letter and Spirit'' 16 ("Interpretatio authentica per modum legis exhibita eandem vim habet ac lex ipsa et promulgari debet; si verba legis in se certa declaret tantum, valet retrorsum; si legem coarctet vel extendataut dubiam explicet, non retrotrahitur.").&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legislators also can entrust the power to authentically interpret their laws to another.&lt;ref&gt;''CIC'', Canon 16, §1; ''CCEO'', Canon 1498, §1.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'', the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'', and other [[Supreme Pontiff|Papal]] laws, the [[Supreme Pontiff]] has delegated authority of authentic interpretation to the [[Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope Saint John Paul II, apostolic constitution ''Pastor Bonus'', Article 155, 80 ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 841 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table lists the authentic interpretations that this [[dicastery]] has issued (with [[Supreme Pontiff|Papal]] approbation).

==Rules of interpretation==
In general, the authentic interpretation of a law may be made by the legislator or his successor or superior, but when this is not the case recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation. It is for this latter mode that rules have been formed.

===Words===

The specific words of a law are understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be understood otherwise. When words are unambiguous, they must not be twisted into another, improbable signification. If the intention of the legislator regarding words in question is known, interpretation must accord therewith, rather than with the usual signification of the words, because in this instance the words are said not to be ''nude'' but rather ''clothed'' with the will of the legislator.

When a law is stated in general terms, it is presumed that no exception was intended; that is, if the general law states no exception, interpreters may not distinguish specific cases. Regarding all interpretations, however, that signification of the words in question is to be preferred that favors [[Equity (law)|equity]] rather than strict [[justice]]. An argument can be made from the contrary signification of the words, provided that it does produce a result that is absurd, inappropriate, or contradicted by another law. Further, the provisions of a prior statute are presumed not to be changed beyond the express signification of the words of a new law.

When a law is [[penal]] in nature, its words are to be construed in their strictest sense and not to be extended to cases that are not explicitly stated, but when a law concedes favors, its words are to be interpreted in their widest sense. "In contracts, words are to be taken in their full [plena] meaning, in last wills in a wider [plenior] sense, and in grants of favours in their widest [plenissimi] interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;C. ''Cum Dilecti'', 6 de donat.&lt;/ref&gt; When the signification of words is doubtful, that sense is to be preferred that does not prejudice the rights of a third person, i. e., a person whom the law does not directly affect or concern.

Words of a law are never presumed to be superfluous. Words must be considered in their context. An interpretation of words that renders the law in question futile is a false interpretation. When words are in the [[future tense]], and even when they are in the [[imperative mood]] regarding the judge, but not regarding the crime, the [[Sentence (law)|penalty]] is understood to be incurred not ''ipso facto'' but only upon judicial sentence. When words are doubtful they must be presumed to favor the subjects thereof and not the legislator.

==Magisterial doctrine on canonical interpretation "within the Church"==
The instructions of the [[Magisterium]] regarding [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and its interpretation are binding ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' insofar as it teaches of the law.&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt; The juridically binding instructions on canonical interpretation of the [[Magisterium]] are primarily given in the [[allocution]]s of the [[Supreme Pontiff]]s to the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]].&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], in his address of 21 January 2012 to the [[Roman Rota]], taught that canonical law can only be interpreted and fully understood within the [[Catholic Church]] in the light of her mission and [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] structure, and that "the work of the interpreter must not be deprived of 'vital contact with ecclesial reality":&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI&gt;Pope Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address''.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|All things considered, the hermeneutics of canonical laws is most closely tied to the very understanding of the law of the Church....In such realistic prospectiveness, the interpretative undertaking, at times arduous, takes on meaning and purpose. The use of the interpretive meaning foreseen by the Code of Canon Law in can. 17, beginning with "the proper meaning of the words considered in their text and context", is no longer a mere logical exercise. It has to do with an assignment that is vivified by an authentic contact with the comprehensive reality of the Church, which allows one to penetrate the true meaning of the letter of the law. Something then occurs, similar to what I said about the inner process of St Augustine in biblical hermeneutics: "the transcending of the letter has rendered the letter itself credible".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'', citing Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini, 30 September 2010, 38: AAS 102 (2010), p. 718, n. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a manner, also in the hermeneutics of the law is it confirmed that the authentic horizon is that of the juridical truth to love, to seek out and to serve.

It follows that the interpretation of canonical law must take place within the Church. This is not a matter of mere external circumstance, subject to the environs: it is a calling to the same ''humus'' of Canon Law and the reality regulated by it. ''Sentire cum Ecclesia''  takes on meaning also within the discipline, by reason of the doctrinal foundations that are always present and operative within the legal norms of the Church. In this manner, is also applied to Canon Law that hermeneutics of renewal in continuity of which I spoke in reference to the Second Vatican Council&lt;ref group=note&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'', citing his Discourse to the Roman Curia of 22 December 2005: AAS 98 (2006), pp. 40-53., https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia.html&lt;/ref&gt; so closely bound to the current canonical legislation. Christian maturity leads one to love the law ever more and want to understand it and to apply it faithfully.&lt;ref name=BenedictXVI/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The '''Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für evolutionäre Anthropologie}}, shortened to '''MPI EVA''') is a research institute based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, founded in 1997. It is part of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck Society]] network.

The institute comprises four departments (Evolutionary [[Genetics]], [[Human Evolution]], [[Primatology]] and [[Evolutionary ecology|Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture]]), several Research Groups, and The Leipzig School of Human Origins. About 375 people are currently employed at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eva.mpg.de/staff.html Staff].eva.mpg.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Department of [[Linguistics]], which ran from 1998 to 2015, was closed in May 2015, upon the retirement of its director, [[Bernard Comrie]]. The former Department of Developmental and Comparative [[Psychology]] operated from 1998 to 2018 under director [[Michael Tomasello]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/index.html Former Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology]. eva.mpg.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eva.mpg.de/interim-group-developmental-and-comparative-psychology/index.html Interim group Developmental and Comparative Psychology]. eva.mpg.de.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known scientists currently based at the institute include [[Svante Pääbo]] (genetics), [[Michael Tomasello]] (psychology), [[Christophe Boesch]] (primatology), [[Jean-Jacques Hublin]] (evolution) and [[Richard McElreath]] (evolutionary ecology).

== Neanderthal genome ==
In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for [[Evolutionary Anthropology]] and [[454 Life Sciences]] announced that they would be [[sequencing]] the [[Neanderthal Genome Project|Neanderthal genome]]. Results of the study were published in the May 2010 journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' detailing an initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. It was thought that a comparison of the Neanderthal genome and human genome would expand our understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Neanderthal genome project launches | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13955661/ | accessdate = 2006-08-22 | author = Moulson, Geir | publisher = Associated Press | work = [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/ MSNBC.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study determined that some mixture of genes occurred between Neanderthals and [[anatomically modern humans]] and presented evidence that elements of their genome remain in that of non-African modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Green RE, Krause J, Briggs AW, etal |title=A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome |journal=Science |volume=328 |issue=5979 |pages=710–22 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20448178 |doi=10.1126/science.1188021 |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/Science_Green.pdf |pmc=5100745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/PR_MPI_Neandertal_EN.pdf The Neanderthal in Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA researcher [[Svante Pääbo]] tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one that had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a [[femur]] found in 1980 at [[Vindija Cave]] in Croatia shows that [[Neanderthal]]s and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' share about 99.5% of their DNA. It is believed that the two species shared a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. The authors of the ''Nature'' article have calculated that the species diverged about 516,000 years ago, whereas fossil records show a time of about 400,000 years ago. From DNA records, scientists hope to confirm or deny the theory that there was interbreeding between the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/science/16neanderthalcnd.html | work=The New York Times | title=New Machine Sheds Light on DNA of Neanderthals | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early ''Homo sapiens'' ==
Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the [[Jebel Irhoud]] site and its ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth and limb bones which had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old.&lt;ref name="HublinBen-Ncer2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hublin|first1=Jean-Jacques|last2=Ben-Ncer|first2=Abdelouahed|last3=Bailey|first3=Shara E.|last4=Freidline|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Neubauer|first5=Simon|last6=Skinner|first6=Matthew M.|last7=Bergmann|first7=Inga|last8=Le Cabec|first8=Adeline|last9=Benazzi|first9=Stefano|last10=Harvati|first10=Katerina|last11=Gunz|first11=Philipp|title=New fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco and the pan-African origin of Homo sapiens|journal=Nature|volume=546|issue=7657|year=2017|pages=289–292|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature22336}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a [[Florisbad Skull|skull]] dating to 260,000 years ago found at the other end of the continent, in [[Florisbad]], [[South Africa]], which has been attributed to ''Homo sapiens'' on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/07/oldest-homo-sapiens-bones-ever-found-shake-foundations-of-the-human-story|title=Oldest Homo sapiens bones ever found shake foundations of the human story|last=Sample|first=Ian|work=The Guardian|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HublinBen-Ncer2017" /&gt;

[[File:Hublin at Jebel Irhoud.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Jacques Hublin]] at Jebel Irhoud (Morocco), pointing to the crushed human skull (Irhoud 10) whose orbits are visible just beyond his finger tip.]]
The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring.&lt;ref name="RichterGrün2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richter|first1=Daniel|last2=Grün|first2=Rainer|last3=Joannes-Boyau|first3=Renaud|last4=Steele|first4=Teresa E.|last5=Amani|first5=Fethi|last6=Rué|first6=Mathieu|last7=Fernandes|first7=Paul|last8=Raynal|first8=Jean-Paul|last9=Geraads|first9=Denis|last10=Ben-Ncer|first10=Abdelouahed|last11=Hublin|first11=Jean-Jacques|last12=McPherron|first12=Shannon P.|title=The age of the hominin fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and the origins of the Middle Stone Age|journal=Nature|volume=546|issue=7657|year=2017|pages=293–296|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature22335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use [[thermoluminescence dating]] to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to around 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. This would make the remains the earliest known examples of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/science/human-fossils-morocco.html|title=Oldest Fossils of Homo Sapiens Found in Morocco, Altering History of Our Species|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|work=The New York Times|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdYong2017June"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/ |title= Scientists Have Found the Oldest Known Human Fossils |last=Yong|first=Ed |author-link= Ed Yong |date=7 June 2017 |work= [[The Atlantic]] |accessdate= 7 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This suggests that, rather than modern humans arising in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, it appears that humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to Jean-Jacques Hublin, "The idea is that early ''Homo sapiens'' dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a "green [[Sahara]]", around 300,000 to 330,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/world-s-oldest-homo-sapiens-fossils-found-morocco|title=World’s oldest Homo sapiens fossils found in Morocco|last=Gibbons|first=Ann|work=[[Science (magazine)|Science]]|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Atlas of Language Structures ==
In 2005, the [[World Atlas of Language Structures]], a project of the institute's former Department of Linguistics, was published. The Atlas consists of over 140 maps, each displaying a particular language feature – for example [http://wals.info/feature/87 order of adjective and noun] – for between 120 and 1370 languages of the world. In 2008 the [http://wals.info/ Atlas was also published online] and the underlying database made freely available.

They used to maintain also the [[Glottolog]] until 2015, when it was taken over by the [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History]] in [[Jena]].

== Early childhood language acquisition ==

{{main|Language acquisition#Chunking}}

Researchers at the institute have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots into which they could put certain kinds of words. The rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news173979856.html "Toddlers develop individualized rules for grammar", October 5, 2009, [[PhysOrg]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''McCarthy 91 function''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]], defined by the [[computer scientist]] [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] as a test case for [[formal verification]] within [[computer science]].

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 M(M(n+11)), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The results of evaluating the function are given by ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;91 for all integer arguments ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;100, and ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;10 for ''n'' &amp;gt; 100. Indeed, the result of M(101) is also 91 (101 - 10 = 91). All results of M(n) after n = 101 are continually increasing by 1, e.g. M(102) = 92, M(103) = 93.

==History==
The 91 function was introduced in papers published by [[Zohar Manna]], [[Amir Pnueli]] and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] in 1970.  These papers represented early developments towards the application of [[formal methods]] to [[formal verification|program verification]].  The 91 function was chosen for being nested-recursive (contrasted with [[single recursion]], such as defining &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;).  The example was popularized by Manna's book, ''Mathematical Theory of Computation'' (1974). As the field of Formal Methods advanced, this example appeared repeatedly in the research literature.
In particular, it is viewed as a "challenge problem" for automated program verification.

It is easier to reason about [[tail recursion|tail-recursive]] control flow, this is an equivalent ([[extensionality|extensionally equal]]) definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mt(n)= Mtaux(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mtaux(n, c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\\
 Mtaux(n-10, c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0 \\
 Mtaux(n+11, c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
As one of the examples used to demonstrate such reasoning, Manna's book includes a tail-recursive algorithm equivalent to the nested-recursive 91 function. Many of the papers that report an "automated verification" (or [[termination proof]]) of the 91 function only handle the tail-recursive version.

This is an equivalent [[mutual recursion|mutually]] tail-recursive definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mmt(n)= Mmtaux(n,0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 Mmtaux2(n-10,c), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n+11,c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux2(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n,c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }c \ne 0\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
A formal derivation of the mutually tail-recursive version from the nested-recursive one was given in a 1980 article by [[Mitchell Wand]], based on the use of [[continuation]]s.

==Examples==
Example A:

 M(99) = M(M(110)) since 99 ≤ 100
       = M(100)    since 110 &gt; 100
       = M(M(111)) since 100 ≤ 100
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

Example B:

 M(87) = M(M(98))
       = M(M(M(109)))
       = M(M(99))
       = M(M(M(110)))
       = M(M(100))
       = M(M(M(111)))
       = M(M(101))
       = M(91)
       = M(M(102))
       = M(92)
       = M(M(103))
       = M(93)
    .... Pattern continues increasing till M(99), M(100) and M(101), exactly as we saw on the example A)
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

==Code==
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (defun mc91 (n)
   (cond ((&lt;= n 100) (mc91 (mc91 (+ n 11))))
         (t (- n 10))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
  mc91 n 
    | n &gt; 100   = n - 10
    | otherwise = mc91 $ mc91 $ n + 11
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let rec mc91 n =
    if n &gt; 100 then n - 10
    else mc91 (mc91 (n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let mc91 n =
    let rec aux n c =
      if c = 0 then n
      else if n &gt; 100 then aux (n - 10) (c - 1)
      else aux (n + 11) (c + 1)
    in
    aux n 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
 def mc91(n):
    if n &gt; 100:
        return n - 10
    else:
        return mc91(mc91(n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     if( n &gt; 100 ) {
         return n - 10;
     } else {
         return mc91(mc91(n+11));
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     mc91taux(n, 1);
 }

 int mc91taux(int n, int c)
 {
     if( c != 0 ) {
         if( n &gt; 100 ) {
             return mc91taux(n - 10, c - 1);
         } else {
             return mc91taux(n + 11, c + 1);
         }
     } else {
         return n;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Proof==
Here is a proof that the function is equivalent to non-recursive:
:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 91, &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101,

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(n + 11 - 10), where n + 11 &gt;= 101 since n &gt;= 90
      = M(n + 1)

So ''M''(''n'') = 91 for 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101.

We can use this as a base case for [[Inductive proof|induction]] on blocks of 11 numbers, like so:

Assume that ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''a'' ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'' + 11.

Then, for any ''n'' such that ''a'' - 11 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'',

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(91), by hypothesis, since a ≤ n + 11 &lt; a + 11
      = 91, by the base case.

Now by induction ''M''(''n'') = 91 for any ''n'' in such a block. There are no holes between the blocks, so ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''n'' &amp;lt; 101. We can also add ''n'' = 101 as a special case.

== Knuth's generalization ==

[[Donald Knuth]] generalized the 91 function to include additional parameters. [[John Cowles]] developed a formal proof that Knuth's generalized function was total, using the [[ACL2]] theorem prover.

'''Museolog''' is a web-driven [[software]] system for cataloging museum information. It is an advanced tool for museum records management, based on the international standards. It was developed by EUROCLID within the UNESCO HeritageNet project, and localized by the non-governmental organization, Open Systems. Using this software, initial functions of input and editing of museum catalogues are provided what has been described as "a modern intuitive graphical interface using forms and menus." Museolog is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/museolog/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing museum objects==

Museolog allows the user to create a record across several interactive sessions. It is also possible to save non-validated, incomplete records for future completion.

Access to the database is regulated by a system of managing access rights, to various levels of functionaries in the museum.

It is also possible manage object movements (when an object is moved from one place to another within the museum, or on loan to an external place), and restoration work. To track movement, a 'movement sheet' is printed. This software allows the user to print a list of all objects on loan, including details like origin and destination place.

When restoration work is undertaken, the type of work (e.g. cleaning), the physical method used, and digital photos taken before and after can be recorded.

==Searching the museum==

Searching and selecting records is also possible, from the catalogue, through the use of Boolean queries. Retrieved records are shown as a short-list of titles; clicking on any would show the full record. Selected records are printable, with any relevant images inserted in the document.

In keeping with current methods of photographing museum exhibits, digital images are indexed in the database. These images are archived, using recordable CD-roms. CDs are then numbered and indexed in the database, making retrieval easy of all museum objects.

==More functions==

Users can save the current state of the database on a CD-R; there is the possibility of rebuilding this when needed due to any possible hardware or software crash. Data from the database can also be exported in XML format, making it transferable to other databases or website. This software also allows for managing [[thesauri]] and authority lists. Users can load, browse, edit and export [[thesauri]] and terminology resources, thus allowing for cooperative terminology definition and exchanges.

==Versions available==

As of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556 July 7, 2007] the versions that were available were [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148371 4.5-6 for Linux] and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148372 4.6 for Windows], both released in mid-2005.

'''Nanofountain probe (NFP)''' is a cantilevered micro-fluidic device terminated in a nanofountain.  The embedded [[microfluidics]] facilitates rapid and continuous delivery of molecules from the on-chip reservoirs to the fountain tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the substrate, a liquid [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] forms, providing a path for molecular transport to the [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]].  By controlling the geometry of the meniscus through hold time and deposition speed, various inks and biomolecules could be patterned on a surface, with sub 100&amp;nbsp;nm resolution.

[[File:Nanofountain probe-SEM and Oprtical Image.tif|thumb|right|Optical image of an array (left) and SEM image of the tip (right)]]

== Historical background ==

The advent of [[Dip-Pen Nanolithography|dip-pen nanolithography (DPN)]] in recent years represented a revolution in [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] patterning technology. With sub-100-nanometer resolution and an architecture conducive to massive parallelization, DPN is capable of producing large arrays of nanoscale features. As such, conventional DPN and other probe-based techniques are generally limited in their rate of deposition and by the need for repeated re-inking during extended patterning.

To address these challenges, nanofountain probe was developed by Espinosa et al. where [[Microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannels]] were embedded in AFM probes to transport ink or bio-molecules from reservoirs to substrates, realizing continuous writing at the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Kim, K.-H., et al. Massively parallel multi-tip nanoscale write with fluidic capabilities-fountain pen nanolithography (FPN). in ''Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on MEMS and Nanotechnology''. 2003. Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; Integration of continuous liquid ink feeding within the NFP facilitates more rapid deposition and eliminates the need for repeated dipping, all while preserving the sub-100-nanometer resolution of DPN.

== Microfabrication ==

Nano fountain probes (NFPs) are fabricated on the wafer-scale using [[microfabrication]] techniques allowing for batch fabrication of numerous chips.&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, N., K.-H. Kim, and H.D. Espinosa, Design and fabrication of a novel microfluidic nanoprobe. Journal of Micromechanical Systems, 2006. 15: p. 204-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the different generations of devices, design and experimentation improved the device yielding to a robust fabrication process. The highly enhanced feature dimension and shapes is expected to improve the performance in writing and imaging.

== Applications ==

=== Direct-write nanopatterning ===

NFP is used in the development of a to scale, direct-write nanomanufacturing platform. The platform is capable of constructing complex, highly-functional nanoscale devices from a diverse suite of materials (e.g., nanoparticles, catalysts (increase rate of reaction), biomolecules, and chemical solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Loh, O.Y., et al., Electric field-induced direct delivery of proteins by a nanofountain probe. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2008. 105: p. 16438–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Demonstrated nanopatterning capabilities include:

• Biomolecules (proteins, [[DNA]]) for biodetection assays or [[cell adhesion]] studies

• Functional nanoparticles for [[drug delivery]] studies and nanosystems making (fabrication)

• Catalysts for carbon nanotube growth in nanodevice fabrication

• Thiols for directed self-assembly of nanostructures.



=== Direct in-vitro single-cell injection ===

Taking advantage of the unique tip geometry of the NFP nanomaterials are directly injected into live cells with minimal invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Loh, O., et al., Nanofountain-probe-based high-resolution patterning and single-cell injection of functionalized nanodiamonds. Small, 2009. 5: p. 1667-1674.&lt;/ref&gt; This enables unique studies of [[Nanomedicine|nanoparticle]]-mediated delivery, as well as cellular pathways and toxicity. Whereas typical in [[In vitro|vitro]] studies are limited to cell populations, these broadly-applicable tools enable multifaceted interrogation at a truly single cell level.

The '''National Aptitude Test in Architecture''' ('''NATA'''), is conducted by [[National Institute of Advanced Studies in Architecture]] ([[NIASA]]) which is a body of [[Council of Architecture]], [[New Delhi]] in [[India]]. The National Aptitude Test in Architecture &lt;ref name="nata."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nata.in|title=Home|publisher=nata.in|accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a national level examination for admission to undergraduate courses in Architecture. The test measures the aptitude of applicants for a specific field of study, i.e. [[Architecture]], in areas like drawing and observation skills, sense of proportion, aesthetic sensitivity and critical thinking, qualities that have been acquired over a long period of time and that are related to Architecture.
NATA or the [[AIEEE]] B.Arch exam are prescribed by the Council of Architecture as a compulsory criterion for taking admission to any Architectural College or course in India.

== Scheme of Examination ==

1. National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) is being conducted by the Council of Architecture at national level for admission to 5 year B.Arch Degree Course at all recognized institutions across India.&lt;br /&gt; 
2. NATA scores are used by admissions authorities of different Government, Govt. Aided &amp; Unaided schools / colleges of Architecture.&lt;br /&gt; 
3. The test measures drawing and observation skills, sense of proportion, aesthetic sensitivity and critical thinking ability.&lt;br /&gt; 
4. The test is in two parts. A paper based drawing test for two hours and computer based online aesthetic sensitivity test.

The '''Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act''' ('''NAGPRA'''), Pub. L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a [[United States federal law]] enacted on 16 November 1990.

The Act requires [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] and institutions that receive federal funding&lt;ref&gt;The [[Smithsonian Institution]] is exempt from this act, but rather must comply with similar requirements under the [[National Museum of American Indian act|National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; to return [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] "cultural items" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the [[repatriation]] process and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply.

NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding.

Lastly, NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense may reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.

==Background==
The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long-standing claims by [[federally recognized tribes]] for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from prehistoric, historic, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and [[indigenous rights]], prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items—human remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony—to proven lineal descendants, culturally related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups.

Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections' holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.&lt;ref name=CARRILLO&gt;Carrillo, Jo (1998). ''Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival'' Temple University Press, Philadelphia. {{ISBN|1-56639-582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal concerns===
Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary.
*State [[Statutory Law]]: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes.
*[[Common Law]]: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves.
*[[Equal Protection]]: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races.
*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the first amendment.
*[[Sovereignty]] Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.
*[[Treaty]]: From the beginning of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government in a treaty. The U.S.&amp;nbsp;government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty.

==Description==
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990.  The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"&gt;[[William C. Canby, Jr.|Canby&amp;nbsp;Jr., William&amp;nbsp;C.]] (2004). ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul: West,. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands.  The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to [[lineal descendants]].  If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"/&gt; Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood.  Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.

Congress attempted to "strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |title=Native American Graves Protection Act |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231023931/http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe.  This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nagpra/FAQ/INDEX.HTM Frequently Asked Questions - NAGPRA], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes.  Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; 

[[Image:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb | right | 350px | Map of [[Native American reservations]]]]
The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories.  Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that  activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities.  For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project.  For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation.  The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land.  The act allows [[archaeology|archaeological]] teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned.  Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).

A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American "cultural items." Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered "associated" if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. "Unassociated" funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by—or were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of—the agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated masscataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and [[Native Hawaiian]] organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of [[archaeology]] and [[physical anthropology]] in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that were felt to be constructive by all parties.

==History==

===Background===
The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history in regards to the loss of cultural artifacts and land.  With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of [[anthropology]] and [[archeology]] as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered  ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers.  As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century.  Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo, Jo, ed. ''Readings In American Indian Law.'' Temple University Press, 1998. Pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Pearson===
[[Maria Pearson]] is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" and the "[[Rosa Parks]] of NAGPRA".&lt;ref name="Still Running" /&gt; In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in [[Glenwood, Iowa]]. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor [[Robert D. Ray]], finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. "You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.

Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to [[Lobbying|lobby]] national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA.&lt;ref name="Still Running"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gradwohl|first=David M. |author2=Joe B.

===Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds===
The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the [[Slack Farm]] in [[Kentucky]], in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle over Athlete Jim Thorpe's burial site continues |newspaper=Washington Post |date=17 March 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/battle-over-athlete-jim-thorpes-burial-site-continues/2012/02/21/gIQAn5DLES_story_4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine'', March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, several protests at the [[Dickson Mounds]] site in [[Illinois]], where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neighbors Mourn Dickson Mounds` Demise |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 26, 1991 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-26/news/9104170045_1_native-americans-jim-edgar-archeologists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Return to the Earth'' project==
''Return to the Earth'' is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.return2theearth.org|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Religions for Peace|quote=Mission: The Return to the Earth project supports Native Americans in burying unidentifiable ancestral remains now scattered across the United States and enables a process of education and reconciliation between Native and Non-Native peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006.&lt;ref name='mcc'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Mennonite Central Committee]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061120234305/http://www.mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name='mcc'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm|title=Cheyenne Cultural Center|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=City of Clinton, Oklahoma |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407091455/http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial issues==
A few archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories.&lt;ref&gt;George Johnson, "Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists," ''New York Times'', 22 October 1996, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the [[Spirit Cave mummy]]; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nevadajournal.com/nj98/02/cover_story.htm|title=The Nevada Journal: Scalping Science: Sensitivity Run Amok|author=|date=|website=archive.nevadajournal.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennewick Man===
Compliance with the legislation can be complicated.  One example of controversy is that of  [[Kennewick Man]], a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near [[Kennewick, Washington]]. The federally recognized [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], [[Yakima Tribe|Yakima]], and [[Nez Perce tribe]]s had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him.  Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla.

Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable.&lt;ref name="Custred_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Custred, Glynn|title=The Forbidden Discovery of Kennewick Man|journal=Academic Questions|volume=13|issue=3|year=2000|pages=12–30|doi=10.1007/s12129-000-1034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains.&lt;ref&gt;McManamon, F.&amp;nbsp;P. [http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/ Kennewick Man.] ''National Park Service Archeology Program.'' May 2004 (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains.

One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is "more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population." In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area.&lt;ref name="SR2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2017 |title=Tribes lay remains of Kennewick Man to rest |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/20/tribes-lay-remains-of-kennewick-man-to-rest/ |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==
[[File:Distinctive marking of cultural property in Austria-from Flickr 141273020.jpg|thumb|right|Distinctive Marking of Cultural Property, [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]]]]

The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with [[El&amp;nbsp;Salvador]] in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with [[Canada]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Mali]] and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It is not an easy business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Phyllis Mauch. ''The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property Whose Culture? Whose Property?'' New York: University of New Mexico, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970525145320/http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |archivedate=May 25, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures.

[[File:Minik in New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minik Wallace]] ([[Kalaallit]]) in New York, 1897]]
On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant [[Robert Peary]] brought six [[Inuit]] people from [[Greenland]] to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, at the request of the [[anthropologist]] Franz Boas, in order to "obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance" regarding Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David H. ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity,'' p.78. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;  About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit people became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. These people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] with [[tuberculosis]], which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died and shortly after that two more followed. By the time the sickness had run its course, two men survived.  ''[[Minik Wallace|Minik]]'' was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while ''Uissakassak'' returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father's skeleton on display in the museum.

In 1993 the museum finally agreed to [[Minik Wallace#Inuit burial|return the four Inuit skeletons]] to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"&gt;[[David Hurst Thomas|Thomas, David&amp;nbsp;H.]] ''Skull Wars,'' pp. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hurst Thomas]]' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"/&gt;

===Protecting cultural property===
In the United States, the [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act]] (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites to conserve associated the cultural property.

Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains:

*Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade.  Countries that use these laws include Canada, [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].
*Total [[export restriction]] laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property.  Many [[Latin America]]n and Mediterranean countries use these laws.
*Other countries, such as [[Mexico]], use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

'''Nave's Topical Bible''' is a book written by [[Orville Nave|Orville James Nave]] (1841–1917) and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]. Nave was a chaplain in the United States Army and referred to his work as "the result of fourteen years of delight and untiring study of the Word of God." &lt;ref name="christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.christianity.com/Concordances/|title= Nave's Topical Bible|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topical [[concordance of the Bible]], and contains Biblical references to over 20,000 topics. Scripture is quoted over 100,000 times; the same Scripture citation may appear under several headings.

The topic headings are broad, covering many religious concepts, geographical regions, and names of Biblical figures. While [[theological]] concepts such as [[salvation]] and [[worship]] are included, a wide range of topics, such as Biblical references to [[rope]]s, are also included. This reflects the author's intention, as stated in the book's [[preface]], to "...note and classify everything found in the Scriptures".

The book took fourteen years to complete. Its original copyrights were 1896 and 1897. Until at least 1907 the book was published by the Topical Bible Publishing Company of Lincoln Nebraska. At least seven editions have been published, based on the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Version]] of the Bible. Each verse of the Bible is indexed according to the topics it is classified under. Christian figures such as [[Billy Graham]] have endorsed the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11971">In early [[Greek music]] [[music theory|theory]], an '''octave species''' (εἶδος τοῦ διὰ πασῶν, or σχῆμα τοῦ διὰ πασῶν) is a sequence of [[incomposite interval]]s ([[ditone]]s, [[minor third]]s, [[whole tone]]s, [[semitone]]s of various sizes, or [[quarter tone]]s) making up a complete [[octave]] {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=231–32}}. The concept was also important in Medieval and Renaissance music theory.

==Ancient Greek theory==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the enharmonic genus, showing the two component tetrachords {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Greek Dorian chromatic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the chromatic genus {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Dorian diatonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the diatonic genus {{audio|Phrygian mode E.mid|Play}}]]
Greek theorists used two terms interchangeably to describe what we call species: ''eidos'' (εἶδος) and ''skhēma'' (σχῆμα), defined as "a change in the arrangement of incomposite [intervals] making up a compound magnitude while the number and size of the intervals remains the same" ({{harvnb|Aristoxenus|1954|loc=92.7–8 &amp; 92.9–11}} (da Rios), translated in {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=230}}). Cleonides (the Aristoxenian tradition) described (in the diatonic genus) three species of [[perfect fourth|diatessaron]], four of [[perfect fifth|diapente]] and seven of [[octave|diapason]]. Ptolemy in his "Harmonics" called them all generally "species of primary consonances" (εἴδη τῶν πρώτων συμφωνιῶν). [[Boethius]], who inherited Ptolemy's generalization under the term "species primarum consonantiarum" (Inst. mus. IV,14{{Full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--Unless there is a very good reason not to, this should be referenced to Bower's translated edition.--&gt;), expanded species theory of Greeks; along with the traditional orderings of three primary species he introduced three further their orderings {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=149}}. For epistemology of the Antiquity music theory, the most important of all was the octave species, because "from the species of the consonance of the diapason arise what are called ''modes''" {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=153}}.

=== Octave species ===
The basis of octave species was the smaller category of species of the [[perfect fourth]], or ''diatessaron''; when filled in with two intermediary notes, the resulting four notes and three consecutive intervals constitute a "[[tetrachord]]" {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=22}}. The species defined by the different positioning of the intervals within the tetrachord in turn depend upon [[Genus (music)|genus]] first being established {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. Incomposite in this context refers to intervals not composed of smaller intervals.

[[File:Greek Phrygian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Phrygian octave species in the enharmonic genus {{audio|Greek Phrygian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
Most Greek theorists distinguish three genera of the tetrachord: [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic]], [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]], and [[Diatonic genus|diatonic]]. The enharmonic and chromatic genera are defined by the size of their largest incomposite interval (major third and minor third, respectively), which leaves a composite interval of two smaller parts, together referred to as a ''pyknon''; in the diatonic genus, no single interval is larger than the other two combined {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. The earliest theorists to attempt a systematic treatment of octave species, the harmonicists (or school of Eratocles) of the late fifth century BC, confined their attention to the enharmonic genus, with the intervals in the resulting seven octave species being {{harv|Barker|1984–87|loc=2:15}}:

Species of the [[perfect fifth]] (''diapente'') are then created by the addition of a whole tone to the intervals of the tetrachord. The first, or original species in both cases has the ''pyknon'' or, in the diatonic genus, the semitone, at the bottom {{harv|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}} and, similarly, the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller or equal to the higher one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. The whole tone added to create the species of fifth (the "tone of disjunction") is at the top in the first species; the remaining two species of fourth and three species of fifth are regular rotations of the constituent intervals, in which the lowest interval of each species becomes the highest of the next ({{harvnb|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}}; {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=233}}). Because of these constraints, tetrachords containing three different incomposite intervals (compared with those in which two of the intervals are of the same size, such as two whole tones) still have only three species, rather than the six possible permutations of the three elements {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=232}}. Similar considerations apply to the species of fifth.

The species of fourth and fifth are then combined into larger constructions called "systems". The older, central "characteristic octave", is made up of two first-species tetrachords separated by a tone of disjunction, and is called the Lesser Perfect System {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=23–24}}. It therefore includes a lower, first-species fifth and an upper, fourth-species fifth. To this central octave are added two flanking conjuct tetrachords (that is, they share the lower and upper tones of the central octave). This constitutes the Greater Perfect System, with six fixed bounding tones of the four tetrachords, within each of which are two movable pitches. {{harvnb|Ptolemy|1930|loc=D. 49–53}} {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=235}} labels the resulting fourteen pitches with the (Greek) letters from Α ([[Alpha (letter)|Alpha α]]) to Ο ([[Omega (letter)|Omega Ω]]). (A diagram is available at [[Musical system of ancient greece#Systêma ametabolon, an overview of the Tone System|systema ametabolon]])

The Lesser and Greater Perfect Systems exercise constraints on the possible octave species. Some early theorists, such as Gaudentius in his ''Harmonic Introduction'', recognized that, if the various available intervals could be combined in any order, even restricting species to just the diatonic genus would result in twelve ways of dividing the octave (and his 17th-century editor, [[Marcus Meibom]], pointed out that the actual number is 21), but "only seven species or forms are melodic and symphonic" {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=237–39}}. Those octave species that cannot be mapped onto the system are therefore rejected {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=240}}.

==Medieval theory==
In chant theory beginning in the 9th century, the ''New Exposition'' of the composite treatise called ''Alia musica'' developed an eightfold [[Musical mode|modal system]] from the seven diatonic octave species of ancient Greek theory, transmitted to the West through the Latin writings of [[Martianus Capella]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and, most importantly, Boethius. Together with the species of fourth and fifth, the octave species remained in use as a basis of the theory of modes, in combination with other elements, particularly the system of [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|octoechos]] borrowed from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] {{harv|Powers|2001}}.

Species theory in general (not just the ''octave'' species) remained an important theoretical concept throughout Middle Ages. The following appreciation of species as a structural basis of a mode, found in the ''Lucidarium'' (XI, 3) of [[Marchetto of Padua|Marchetto]] (ca. 1317), can be seen as typical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We declare that those who judge the mode of a melody exclusively with regard to ascent and descent cannot be called musicians, but rather blind men, singers of mistake... for, as [[Berno of Reichenau|Bernard]] said, "species are dishes at a musical banquet; they create modes" {{harv|Herlinger|1985|loc=393-395}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by [[conservator-restorer]]s, specifically in the [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]] and [[conservation and restoration of glass objects|glass objects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Paraloid_B-72] Paraloid B-72: Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Material Database&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used for labelling museum objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-04.pdf|title=Use Of Acryloid B-72 Lacquer For Labelling Museum Objects|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.nps.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Paraloid b72.jpg||250px|left|thumb|Paraloid B-72 in pellet form]]
B-72 is a durable and non-yellowing acrylic resin, which can be described chemically as an ethyl-methacrylate copolymer. It is soluble in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]s, among other solvents and solvent mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, A. 1992. Solvents for Paraloid B-72. Conservation News 48:21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidant is that it is stronger and harder than [[polyvinyl acetate]] without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically used adhesives and tolerates more stress and strain on a join than most others. The major drawbacks to using B-72 are related to its handling properties: as in the case of other acrylic resins it is difficult to apply as an adhesive and to manipulate with precision.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. However, solvent mixtures with various proportions of acetone, ethanol, and toluene are frequently used to alter the working time of the resin and to produce slightly different properties (hardness and flexibility, e.g.) in the set resin. Unlike [[cellulose nitrate]], B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Research shows that the silica better distributes the stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of a solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

Because of its transparency and versatility, conservators, led by Stephen Koob of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], have recently begun to use cast sheets of B-72 as a fill material in glass objects.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Giffen|first=Astrid|title=Filling losses with Paraloid B-72.|url=http://www.cmog.org/blog/2011/11/01/filling-losses-with-paraloid-b-72/|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perspiration''', also known as '''sweating''', is the production of fluids secreted by the [[sweat gland]]s in the [[skin]] of [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name="perspiration"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/99/3/781.pdf |title=Simultaneous Study of Constituents of Urine and Perspiration |author=Mosher HH |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |year=1933 |volume=99 |pages=781–790 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[sweat gland]]s can be found in humans: [[eccrine gland]]s and [[Apocrine sweat gland|apocrine gland]]s.&lt;ref name="2017-Hanukoglu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Boggula VR, Vaknine H, Sharma S, Kleyman T, Hanukoglu A | title = Expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and CFTR in the human epidermis and epidermal appendages | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 733–748 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28130590 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-016-1535-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.

In [[human]]s, sweating is primarily a means of [[thermoregulation]], which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/min·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but is less in children prior to puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jessen |first=C. |title=Temperature Regulation in Humans and Other Mammals |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-540-41234-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mack |first=G.

Hence, in [[Temperature|hot]] weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands, such as [[dog]]s, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and [[pharynx]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Sweat contributes to [[body odor]] when it is metabolized by [[bacteria]] on the [[skin]]. Medications that are used for other treatments and diet also affect odor. Some medical conditions, such as [[kidney failure]] and [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], can also affect sweat odor. Areas that produce excessive sweat usually appear pink or white, but, in severe cases, may appear cracked, scaly, and soft.&lt;ref name="Excessive Sweating Information on Healthline.com"&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/sw/gsa-excessive-sweating Excessive Sweating Information on Healthline.com], Retrieved on 2010-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Demonstration_of_Sweat.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man smiles at the camera, his collared shirt drenched in sweat. His brow glistens with sweat from exertion.|A man in a sweat-drenched shirt, presumably after some physical exertion.]]

Diaphoresis is a [[non-specific symptom]] or sign, which means that it has many possible causes. Some causes of diaphoresis include physical exertion, [[menopause]], fever, ingestion of toxins or irritants, and high environmental temperature. Strong emotions (anger, fear, anxiety) and recall of past trauma can also trigger sweating.

The vast majority of sweat glands in the body are innervated by [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[cholinergic]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Boron, Walter F., and Emile L. Boulpaep. "Sweating." Medical Physiology. Updated 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier, 2012. 1260-264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sympathetic postganglionic neurons typically secrete [[norepinephrine]] and are named sympathetic [[adrenergic]] neurons;  however, the sympathetic postganglionic neurons that innervate sweat glands secrete [[acetylcholine]] and hence are termed sympathetic cholinergic neurons. Sweat glands, piloerector muscles, and some blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic neurons.

===Pathological sweating===

Diaphoresis may be associated with some abnormal conditions, such as [[hyperthyroidism]] and shock. If it is accompanied by unexplained [[weight loss]] or [[fever]] or by [[palpitation]]s, [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or chest discomfort, it suggests serious illness.

Diaphoresis is also seen in an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), from the increased firing of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and is frequent in [[serotonin syndrome]]. Diaphoresis can also be caused by many types of infections, often accompanied by [[fever]] and/or [[chills]]. Most infections can cause some degree of diaphoresis and it is a very common symptom in some serious infections such as [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].  In addition, pneumothorax can cause diaphoresis with splinting of the chest wall.
[[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and other malignant diseases (e.g. leukemias) can also cause diaphoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|816018|Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome|clinical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetics relying on [[insulin]] shots or oral medications may have low [[blood sugar]] ([[hypoglycemia]]), which can also cause diaphoresis.

Drugs (including [[caffeine]], [[morphine]], [[alcohol]], antidepressants and certain antipsychotics) may be causes, as well as [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] from [[alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[nonbenzodiazepines]] or [[narcotic]] painkiller dependencies. [[Sympathetic nervous system]] stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] have also been associated with diaphoresis. Diaphoresis due to ectopic [[catecholamine]] is a classic symptom of a [[pheochromocytoma]], a rare [[tumor]] of the [[adrenal gland]]. [[Acetylcholinesterase]] inhibitors (e.g. some [[insecticides]]) also cause contraction of sweat gland smooth muscle leading to diaphoresis.
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is well known for its use as a diaphoretic, and was widely used in the 19th and early 20th century by physicians to "purge" the body of an illness. However, due to the high toxicity of mercury, secondary symptoms would manifest, which were erroneously attributed to the former disease that was being treated with mercurials.

Infantile [[Mercury poisoning#Acrodynia|acrodynia]] (childhood mercury poisoning) is characterized by excessive perspiration.  A clinician should immediately consider acrodynia in an afebrile child who is sweating profusely.

Some people can develop a [[sweat allergy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiragun|first=Takaaki|last2=Hiragun|first2=Makiko|last3=Ishii|first3=Kaori|last4=Kan|first4=Takanobu|last5=Hide|first5=Michihiro|title=Sweat allergy: Extrinsic or intrinsic?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0923181117300397|journal=Journal of Dermatological Science|volume=87|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.1016/j.jdermsci.2017.03.002|pmid=28416076|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/446788|title=Sweat Allergy|journal=Perspiration Research|last=Hiragun|first=Takaaki|last2=Hide|first2=Michihiro|date=2016|volume=51|pages=101–108|language=english|doi=10.1159/000446788|pmid=27584969|series=Current Problems in Dermatology|isbn=978-3-318-05904-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allergy is not due to the sweat itself but instead to an allergy-producing protein secreted by bacteria found on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yokozeki | first = Hiroo | title = Perspiration research | publisher = Karger | location = Basel New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9783318059052 | page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannic-acid has been found to suppress the allergic response along with showering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Hyperhidrosis===
{{Further|Hyperhidrosis}}
In some people, the body's mechanism for cooling itself is overactive—so overactive that they may sweat four or five times more than is typical.&lt;ref name="International Hyperhidrosis Society: About Hyperhidrosis"&gt;[http://www.sweathelp.org/English/PFF_Hyperhidrosis_Definition.asp International Hyperhidrosis Society: About Hyperhidrosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907230825/http://www.sweathelp.org/English/PFF_Hyperhidrosis_Definition.asp |date=2015-09-07 }}, Retrieved on 2010-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of people are affected by this condition, but more than half never receive treatment due to embarrassment or lack of awareness. While it most commonly affects the [[armpits]], feet, and hands, it is possible for someone to experience this condition over their whole body. The face is another common area for hyperhidrosis to be an issue. Sweating uncontrollably is not always expected and may be embarrassing to sufferers of the condition. It can cause both physiological and emotional problems in patients. It is generally an inherited problem that is found in each ethnic group. It is not life-threatening, but it is threatening to a person's quality of life.
A treatment modality is clipping of the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic nerve]] at the level of T4 by thoracoscopic means.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Night sweats===
{{Main|Night sweats}}
Night sweats, also known as nocturnal hyperhidrosis, is the occurrence of excessive sweating during sleep. The person may or may not also perspire excessively while awake.

One of the most common causes of night sweats in women over 40 is the hormonal changes related to menopause and perimenopause. This is a very common occurrence during the menopausal transition years.

While night sweats might be relatively harmless, it can also be a sign of a serious underlying disease. It is important to distinguish night sweats due to medical causes from those that occur simply because the sleep environment is too warm, either because the bedroom is unusually hot or because there are too many covers on the bed. Night sweats caused by a medical condition or infection can be described as "severe hot flashes occurring at night that can drench sleepwear and sheets, which are not related to the environment". Some of the underlying medical conditions and infections that cause these severe night sweats can be life-threatening and should promptly be investigated by a medical practitioner.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Sweaty runner.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man competing in the 2014 Carlsbad Triathlon jogs on a paved path along a beach in Southern California. His expression shows the labor of his effort.|The evaporation of sweat on the skin cools the body.]]
Sweating allows the body to regulate its temperature. Sweating is controlled from a center in the preoptic and anterior regions of the brain's [[hypothalamus]], where thermosensitive neurons are located. The heat-regulatory function of the hypothalamus is also affected by inputs from temperature receptors in the [[skin]]. High skin temperature reduces the hypothalamic set point for sweating and increases the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the hypothalamic [[feedback]] system in response to variations in core [[temperature]]. Overall, however, the sweating response to a rise in hypothalamic ('core') temperature is much larger than the response to the same increase in average skin temperature.

Sweating causes a decrease in core temperature through evaporative cooling at the skin surface. As high energy molecules evaporate from the skin, releasing energy absorbed from the body, the skin and superficial vessels decrease in temperature. Cooled venous blood then returns to the body's core and counteracts rising core temperatures.

There are two situations in which the nerves will stimulate the sweat glands, causing perspiration: during physical heat and during emotional stress. In general, emotionally induced sweating is restricted to [[Palm (hand)|palm]]s, [[Sole (foot)|sole]]s, [[armpit]]s, and sometimes the [[forehead]], while physical heat-induced sweating occurs throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(97)00642-9 |first1=Tomoya |last1=Kameia |first2=Takao |last2=Tsudab |first3=Shinya |last3=Kitagawab |first4=Ken |last4=Naitoha |first5=Koji |last5=Nakashimaa |first6=Toshio |last6=Ohhashi |date=June 1998 |title=Physical stimuli and emotional stress-induced sweat secretions in the human palm and forehead |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=365 |issue=1–3 |pages=319–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have an average of two to four million sweat glands. But how much sweat is released by each gland is determined by many factors, including gender, genetics, environmental conditions, age or fitness level. Two of the major contributors to sweat rate are an individual's fitness level and weight. If an individual weighs more, sweat rate is likely to increase because the body must exert more energy to function and there is more body mass to cool down.  On the other hand, a fit person will start sweating earlier and more readily. As someone becomes fit, the body becomes more efficient at regulating the body's temperature and sweat glands adapt along with the body's other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Julieann|title=The Science of Sweat|url=http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055518/http://certification.acsm.org/blog/2013/may/the-science-of-sweat|archive-date=2013-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweat is not pure [[water]]; it always contains a small amount (0.2–1%) of [[Solution|solute]]. When a person moves from a [[cold]] [[climate]] to a [[Temperature|hot]] climate, adaptive changes occur in the sweating mechanisms of the person. This process is referred to as [[acclimatisation]]: the maximum rate of sweating increases and its solute composition decreases. The volume of water lost in sweat daily is highly variable, ranging from 100 to 8,000 mL/day. The solute loss can be as much as 350&amp;nbsp;mmol/d (or 90&amp;nbsp;mmol/d acclimatised) of [[sodium]] under the most extreme conditions. During average intensity exercise, sweat losses can average up to 2 litres of water/hour.  In a cool climate and in the absence of [[exercise]], sodium loss can be very low (less than 5 mmol/d). Sodium concentration in sweat is 30-65&amp;nbsp;mmol/l, depending on the degree of acclimatisation.

==Composition==
[[File:TranspirationPerspirationCommonsFL.jpg|thumb|alt=Close-up of beads of sweat|Beads of sweat emerging from [[eccrine gland]]s]]

Sweat is mostly [[water]]. A microfluidic model of the eccrine sweat gland provides details on what solutes partition into sweat, their mechanisms of partitioning, and their fluidic transport to the skin surface.&lt;ref name="2015-Sonner"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The microfluidics of the eccrine sweat gland, including biomarker partitioning, transport, and biosensing implications|journal = Biomicrofluidics|date = 2015-05-01|issn = 1932-1058|pmc = 4433483|pmid = 26045728|pages = 031301|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1063/1.4921039|first = Z.|last = Sonner|first2 = E.|last2 = Wilder|first3 = J.|last3 = Heikenfeld|first4 = G.|last4 = Kasting|first5 = F.|last5 = Beyette|first6 = D.|last6 = Swaile|first7 = F.|last7 = Sherman|first8 = J.|last8 = Joyce|first9 = J.|last9 = Hagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dissolved in the water are trace amounts of [[minerals]], [[lactic acid]], and [[urea]]. Although the mineral content varies, some measured concentrations are: [[sodium]] ({{nobreak|0.9 gram/liter}}), [[potassium]] ({{nobreak|0.2 g/L}}), [[calcium]] ({{nobreak|0.015 g/L}}), and [[magnesium]] ({{nobreak|0.0013 g/L}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Montain | first1 = S.

Relative to the plasma and extracellular fluid, the concentration of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is much lower in sweat (~40 mM in sweat versus ~150 mM in plasma and extracellular fluid). Initially, within [[eccrine glands]] sweat has a high concentration of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. In the sweat ducts, the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are re-absorbed into tissue by [[epithelial sodium channels]] (ENaC) that are located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells that form the duct (see Fig. 9 of the reference).&lt;ref name="2017-Hanukoglu" /&gt;

Many other [[trace elements]] are also excreted in sweat, again an indication of their concentration is (although measurements can vary fifteenfold) [[zinc]] ({{nobreak|0.4 milligrams/liter}}), [[copper]] ({{nobreak|0.3–0.8 mg/l}}), [[iron]] ({{nobreak|1 mg/l}}), [[chromium]] ({{nobreak|0.1 mg/l}}), [[nickel]] ({{nobreak|0.05 mg/l}}), and [[lead]] ({{nobreak|0.05 mg/l}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohn JR, Emmett EA |title = The excretion of traces of metals in human sweat |journal = Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science |volume = 8 |issue = 4 |pages = 270–5 |year = 1978 |pmid = 686643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Recep |last1 = Saraymen |first2 = Eser |last2 = Kılıç |first3 = Süleyman |last3 = Yazar |year = 2004 |title = Sweat Copper, Zinc, Iron, Magnesium and Chromium Levels in National Wrestler |url = http://mail.inonu.edu.tr/~tipdergi/include/getdoc.php?id=79&amp;article=35&amp;mode=pdf |journal = İnönü Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Dergisi |volume = 11 |issue = 1 |pages = 7–10 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820121750/http://mail.inonu.edu.tr/~tipdergi/include/getdoc.php?id=79&amp;article=35&amp;mode=pdf |archivedate = 2011-08-20 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably many other less-abundant trace minerals leave the body through sweating with correspondingly lower concentrations. Some exogenous organic compounds make their way into sweat as exemplified by an unidentified odiferous "maple syrup" scented compound in several of the species in the mushroom genus ''Lactarius''.&lt;ref&gt;Aurora, David "Lactarius fragilis" ''Mushrooms Demystified'' 1986 Ten Speed Press, Berkeley California&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, sweat is [[Hypotonicity|hypoosmotic]] relative to [[Blood plasma|plasma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=BRS Physiology |edition=6th |first1=Linda S. |last1=Constanzo |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. less [[Concentration|concentrated]]). Sweat is found at moderately acidic to neutral pH levels, typically between 4.5 and 7.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bandodkar AJ, Hung VW, Jia W, Ramirez GV, Windmiller JR, Martinez AG, Ramirez J, Chan G, Kagan K, Wang J |title = Tattoo-based potentiometric ion-selective sensors for epidermal pH monitoring |url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/an/c2an36422k |journal = Analyst |volume = 138 |issue = 1 |pages = 123–8 |year = 2013 |doi=10.1039/c2an36422k|pmid = 23113321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Artificial perspiration===
Artificial skin capable of sweating similar to natural sweat rates and with the surface texture and wetting properties of regular skin has been developed for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Artificial microfluidic skin for in vitro perspiration simulation and testing|issue = 10|pages = 1868–1875|url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/lc/c3lc41231h|journal = Lab on a Chip|volume = 13|accessdate = 2015-11-13|doi = 10.1039/C3LC41231H|pmid = 23576120|first = Linlin|last = Hou|first2 = Joshua|last2 = Hagen|first3 = Xiao|last3 = Wang|first4 = Ian|last4 = Papautsky|first5 = Rajesh|last5 = Naik|first6 = Nancy|last6 = Kelley-Loughnane|first7 = Jason|last7 = Heikenfeld|date = 2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial perspiration is also available for in-vitro testing, and contains 19 amino acids and the most abundant minerals and metabolites in sweat.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Diagnostics===
There is interest in its use in wearable technology. Sweat can be sampled and sensed non-invasively and continuously using electronic tattoos, bands, or patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heikenfeld|first1=Jason|title=Non-invasive Analyte Access and Sensing through Eccrine Sweat: Challenges and Outlook circa 2016|journal=Electroanalysis|date=2016|volume=28|issue=6|pages=1242–1249|doi=10.1002/elan.201600018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sweat as a diagnostic fluid presents numerous challenges as well, such as very small sample volumes and filtration (dilution) of larger-sized hydrophilic analytes. Currently the only major commercial application for sweat diagnostics is for infant cystic fibrosis testing based on sweat chloride concentrations.

The '''Phenice method''' is a form of gross morphological analysis used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton based on three characteristics of the [[pelvis]]: the ventral arc, sub-pubic concavity, and the medial aspect of the [[ischiopubic ramus]]. It is named after T.{{nbsp}}W. Phenice, who first described the method in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phenice|first=T.W.|title=A newly developed visual method of sexing in the os pubis|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=1969|volume=30|pages=297–301|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330300214|pmid=5772048|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phenice method should only be used for adult individuals because inter-sex differences in the morphology of the pelvis are [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sexual characteristics]] present only in post-pubertal individuals.

==Determining sex using the Phenice method==

===Ventral arc===
The ventral arc is a ridge of bone on the inferior aspect of the anterior surface of the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] present only in females.

===Sub-pubic concavity===
From the anterior view, female [[Hip bone|os coxae]] display concavity of the ischiopubic ramus along the medial edge. In males, the medial edge of the ischiopubic ramus from the anterior view is straight.

===Medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus===
From the medial view, the medial aspect of the ischiopubic ramus has a sharp edge inferior to the pubis in females. In males, this surface is broad and flat.

A '''post''' is a main vertical or leaning support in a structure similar to a [[column]] or pillar but the term post generally refers to a timber but may be metal or stone.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher p.351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary "A stout piece of timber, or other solid material,..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster "A piece (as of timber or metal)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis "...whether of timber, metal, or stone;..." p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwilt p.1243 ""An upright piece of timber set in the earth. Any piece of timber whose office is to support or sustain..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell p. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...every bressummer shall have such other storey posts, iron columns, stanchions, or piers of brick or stone, or corbels, as may be sufficient to carry the superstructure." ''The London building acts 1894 to 1905'' p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; A stud in wooden or metal building construction is similar but lighter duty than a post and a [[Strut#Architecture and construction|strut]] may be similar to a stud or act as a brace. In the U.K. a strut may be very similar to a post but not carry a beam.&lt;ref&gt;Harris&lt;/ref&gt;   In wood construction posts normally land on a [[Sill plate|sill]], but in rare types of buildings the post may continue through to the foundation called an interrupted sill or into the ground called earthfast, [[post in ground]], or [[posthole]] construction. A post is also a fundamental element in a [[fence]]. The terms "jack" and "cripple" are used with shortened studs and rafters but not posts, except in the specialized vocabulary of [[shoring]].

==Timber framing==
[[Timber framing]] is a general term for building with wooden posts and beams. The term post is the namesake of other general names for timber framing such as post-and-beam, post-and-girt construction and more specific types of timber framing such as [[Post and lintel]], [[Pole building framing|post-frame]], [[post in ground]], and ridge-post construction. In roof construction such as [[king post]], [[queen post]], [[crown post]] framing. A round post is often called a pole or mast depending on its diameter thus [[pole building framing]], or a [[Stave church|mast church]].

===Post and strut names in traditional timber framing===
*Wall~: A general term for a post in a wall.
*Principal~ A primary support. Principal is a general term meaning a "major" member often distinguished from "common" or "minor" members.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;
*Angle~ A historical name for a corner post.
*Intermediate~ A post in an exterior wall not at a corner.
*Chimney~ An intermediate post receiving its name from being near a chimney.
*Interior~ A general term for posts not in an exterior wall.
*Arcade~ A post located between an [[aisle]] and [[nave]].&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aisle~ same as arcade post.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G1&lt;/ref&gt;
*Corner~ Any post at the corner of a building.
*Story~ A post only one story tall as in "storeyed construction"&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. F15&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[platform framing]].
*Prick~ 1) Same as story post, a one-story post for extra support at a particular location; 2) In a roof truss a side post.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ridge~ A post extending from the ground or foundation to the ridge beam.
*Samson~ similar to a prick post or puncheon.
*Puncheon: 1) A short, stout post may be identical to a prick post; 2) Puncheon may also mean a split log or heavy slab of timber with the face smoothed, used for flooring or construction.
*Dragon~ (rare) A corner post supporting a [[dragon beam]] in [[Jettying|jetty]] framing.
*Gunstock~, jowled~, flared~, teasel~ (rare). A flared post, larger at the top than the bottom, most commonly found in the side walls but could be any location. Rarely a post may have an "integral bracket"&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. F3&lt;/ref&gt; which is a mid-post flair to carry a lower timber. The portion of a flared post extending upward at the top is called the upstand&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G20&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the top tenons is called a teazle (teasel) tenon.
*Jetty~ A post supporting a [[Jettying|jetty]]
*Door~: A post framing a doorway.
*Blade: A specific name for the post-like timber in [[cruck]] framing.
*Cruck stud: The upright stud or post forming a wall, mounted on a cruck blade and held by a cruck spur.
*Pile, piling: A post driven or set into the ground such as in earthfast, [[post in ground]], or "[[posthole]] construction".&lt;ref&gt;Alcock F33&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stave: 1) Small, narrow pieces of wood used in a variety of ways;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; 2) Upright planks carrying a wall.;&lt;ref&gt;Alcock F33&lt;/ref&gt; 3) Posts carrying a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post and strut names in roof framing===
*[[King post|King]]~ 1) (U.S.) A single, central post in a roof truss in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] between the rafters ([[Truss|top chords]]) and a tie beam (bottom chord), or 2) (U.S.) A short of the tie beam only supporting the rafters via struts. 3) (U.K.) A king post specifically carries a ridge beam otherwise is called a '''king strut'''. "King post" was formerly used to describe a crown post in the U. K., but no longer.&lt;ref&gt;Harris&lt;/ref&gt;
*King pendant: A central, upright timber in a truss projecting below the lowest beam, "normally used with scissor beams".&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G13&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Queen post|Queen]]~  1) A pair of vertical posts in a roof system that are part of a [[truss]], with a straining beam between and in tension holding up a tie beam or; 2) Two posts in a roof system not acting as a truss in the engineering sense and here in compression.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis p. 195-196&lt;/ref&gt; Also called a queen strut.
*Queen strut: 1)(U.K.) A queen post which does not carry a plate.;&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G14&lt;/ref&gt; 2)(U.S.) A queen post not part of a truss in the engineering sense and in compression (a more modern definition than 2)in Queen Post above).&lt;ref&gt;"Timber Framing for Beginners: VI.

*princess~ A strut associated with a queen strut but shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G18&lt;/ref&gt;
*Crown~: A post on a tie beam or collar beam carrying a crown plate.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G5&lt;/ref&gt;
*Crown strut: A piece similar to a crown post but not carrying a plate.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock p. G5&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

Because the collection has the overall appearance of a single flower, the collection of flowers in the head of this [[Helianthus annuus|sunflower]] is called a '''pseudanthium''' or a composite.]]

A '''pseudanthium''' (Greek for "false flower"), also called a '''flower head''' or '''composite flower''',&lt;ref name="Chester_2016"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chester |first=Sharon |year=2016 |title=The Arctic Guide: Wildlife of the Far North |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDD9CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA514&amp;pg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;f=false |isbn=9781400865963 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|514}} is a special type of [[inflorescence]],&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=John|title=The genera of flowering plants (Angiospermae)|year=1964|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|lccn=65000676}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which anything from a small cluster to hundreds or sometimes thousands of [[flower]]s are grouped together to form a single flower-like structure. Pseudanthia take various forms. The individual flowers of a pseudanthium commonly are called florets.&lt;ref name=calfloraGlossary&gt;{{cite web |  title = calflora Botanical Terms | url = http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/botanicalterms.html | accessdate = 2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The real flowers (the florets) are generally small and often greatly reduced, but the pseudanthium itself can sometimes be quite large (as in the heads of some varieties of [[sunflower]]).

Pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Asteraceae]]), whose flowers are differentiated into ray flowers and disk flowers, unique to this family. The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium are [[actinomorphic]] and the [[corolla (flower)|corolla]] is fused into a tube. Flowers on the periphery are [[zygomorphic]] and the corolla has one large lobe (the so-called "petals" of a daisy are individual ray flowers, for example). Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some plants: ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' lacks ray flowers&lt;ref name="MissouriPlants"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Senecio vulgaris L.| publisher=Missouri Plants| date=| url=http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Senecio_vulgaris_page.html| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'' lacks disk flowers.&lt;ref name="MissouriPlants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloridaData"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Taraxacum Officinale| publisher=Florida Data| date=| url=http://www.floridata.com/ref/T/tara_off.cfm| accessdate = 2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudanthium has a whorl of [[bract]]s below the flowers, forming an [[Involucral bract|involucre]].

In all cases, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) is superficially indistinguishable from a flower, but closer inspection of its anatomy will reveal that it is composed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an evolutionary convergence of the inflorescence to a reduced reproductive unit that may function in [[pollination]] like a single flower, at least in plants that are animal pollinated.

'''Head'''&lt;br&gt;
This is an equivalent term for flower head and pseudanthium when used in the botanical sense.&lt;ref name= Jepson&gt;{{cite web | title = The Jepson Herbarium Glossary | url = http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/interchange/JM_glossary.html | accessdate = 2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardenwebHead&gt;{{cite web | title = GardenWeb Glossary of Botanical Terms | url = http://glossary.gardenweb.com/glossary/nph-ind.cgi?scrug=16677&amp;k=head&amp;b=and&amp;r=root&amp;s=both | accessdate = 2012-02-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130525212910/http://glossary.gardenweb.com/glossary/nph-ind.cgi?scrug=16677&amp;k=head&amp;b=and&amp;r=root&amp;s=both | archivedate = 2013-05-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calathid (plural calathids or calathidia)'''&lt;br&gt;
This is a very rarely used term. It was defined in the 1966 book, The genera of flowering plants (Angiospermae), as a specific term for a flower head of a plant in the Asteraceae family.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; However, on-line botanical glossaries do not define it and Google Scholar does not link to any significant usage of the term in a botanical sense.

==Plant families==
[[File:Spathiphyllum cochlearispathum RTBG.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Peace Lily (''[[Spathiphyllum cochlearispathum]]'') pseudanthium]]
Pseudanthia occur in the following plant families:
*[[Apiaceae]] — pseudanthia are called [[umbel]]s
*[[Araceae]] — pseudanthia are called [[spadix (botany)|spadices]]
*[[Asteraceae]]
*[[Campanulaceae]]
*[[Centrolepidaceae]]
*[[Cornaceae]]
*[[Cyperaceae]]
*[[Dipsacaceae]]
*[[Euphorbiaceae]] — pseudanthia are called [[cyathium|cyathia]]
*[[Eriocaulaceae]]
*[[Hamamelidaceae]]
*[[Moraceae]]
*[[Poaceae]]
*[[Pontederiaceae]] — in ''[[Hydrothrix]]''
*[[Proteaceae]]
*[[Rubiaceae]]
*[[Saururaceae]] — in ''[[Anemopsis californica|Anemopsis]]''

In some families it is not yet clear whether the 'flower' represents a pseudanthium, because the anatomical work has not been done (or is still ambiguous due to considerable evolutionary reduction). Possible pseudanthia of this type may occur in the following families:

*[[Hydatellaceae]]
*[[Lemnaceae]]
*[[Pandanaceae]]
*[[Triuridaceae]]
*[[Phyllanthaceae]]&lt;ref&gt;Petra Hoffmann, Hashendra S. Kathriarachchi, and Kenneth J. Wurdack. 2006. "A Phylogenetic Classification of Phyllanthaceae (Malpighiales)." ''Kew Bulletin.'' '''61(1):40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Race condition.svg|frame|Race condition in a logic circuit. Here, ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent the [[propagation delay]]s of the logic elements. When the input value ''A'' changes from low to high, the circuit outputs a short spike of duration (∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) − ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A '''race condition''' or '''race hazard''' is the behavior of an [[electronics]], [[software]], or other [[system]] where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a [[software bug|bug]] when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.

The term '''race condition''' was already in use by 1954, for example in [[David A. Huffman]]'s doctoral thesis "The synthesis of sequential switching circuits". &lt;ref&gt;Huffman, David A. "The synthesis of sequential switching circuits." (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

Race conditions can occur especially in [[logic gate|logic circuits]], [[thread (computing)|multithreaded]] or [[distributed computing|distributed]] software programs.

==Electronics==
A typical example of a race condition may occur when a [[logic gate]] combines signals that have traveled along different paths from the same source. The inputs to the gate can change at slightly different times in response to a change in the source signal. The output may, for a brief period, change to an unwanted state before settling back to the designed state. Certain systems can tolerate such [[glitch]]es but if this output functions as a [[clock signal]] for further systems that contain memory, for example, the system can rapidly depart from its designed behaviour (in effect, the temporary glitch becomes a permanent glitch).

Consider, for example, a two-input [[AND gate]] fed with a logic signal A on one input and its negation, NOT A, on another input. In theory the output (A AND NOT A) should never be true. If, however, changes in the value of A take longer to propagate to the second input than the first when A changes from false to true then a brief period will ensue during which both inputs are true, and so the gate's output will also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.H. |last=Unger |title=Hazards, Critical Races, and Metastability |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=754–768 |date=June 1995 |doi=10.1109/12.391185 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=391185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design techniques such as [[Karnaugh map]]s encourage designers to recognize and eliminate race conditions before they cause problems. Often [[logic redundancy]] can be added to eliminate some kinds of races.

As well as these problems, some logic elements can enter [[metastability (electronics)|metastable states]], which create further problems for circuit designers.

===Critical and non-critical forms===
A ''critical race condition'' occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed determines the eventual state that the [[finite-state machine|state machine]] will end up in.

A ''non-critical race condition'' occurs when the order in which internal variables are changed does not determine the eventual state that the state machine will end up in.

===Static, dynamic, and essential forms===
A ''static race condition'' occurs when a signal and its complement are combined together.

A ''dynamic race condition'' occurs when it results in multiple transitions when only one is intended. They are due to interaction between gates. It can be eliminated by using no more than two levels of gating.

An ''essential race condition'' occurs when an input has two transitions in less than the total feedback propagation time. Sometimes they are cured using inductive [[analog delay line|delay line]] elements to effectively increase the time duration of an input signal.

==Software==
Race conditions arise in software when an application depends on the sequence or timing of [[process (computing)|processes]] or [[thread (computing)|threads]] for it to operate properly. As with electronics, there are critical race conditions that result in invalid execution and [[software bug|bugs]]. Critical race conditions often happen when the processes or threads depend on some shared state. Operations upon shared states are [[critical section]]s that must be [[mutual exclusion|mutually exclusive]]. Failure to obey this rule opens up the possibility of corrupting the shared state.

The [[memory model (programming)|memory model]] defined in the [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] and [[C++11]] standards uses the term "data race" for a race condition caused by potentially concurrent operations on a shared memory location, of which at least one is a write. A C or C++ program containing a data race has [[undefined behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57853 |title=ISO/IEC 9899:2011 - Information technology - Programming languages - C |publisher=Iso.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink= ISO |title= ISO/IEC 14882:2011 |publisher= ISO |date= 2 September 2011 |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50372 |accessdate= 3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Race conditions have a reputation of being difficult to reproduce and debug, since the end result is [[nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]] and depends on the relative timing between interfering threads. Problems occurring in production systems can therefore disappear when running in debug mode, when additional logging is added, or when attaching a debugger, often referred to as a "[[Heisenbug]]". It is therefore better to avoid race conditions by careful software design rather than attempting to fix them afterwards.

===Example===
As a simple example, let us assume that two threads want to increment the value of a global integer variable by one. Ideally, the following sequence of operations would take place:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Thread 1 !! Thread 2 !! !! Integer value
|-
|   ||   ||  || 0
|-
| read value ||   || ← || 0
|-
| style="background: wheat;" | increase value ||  || || 0
|-
| write back ||  || → || 1
|-
| || read value   || ← || 1
|-
| || style="background: wheat;" | increase value || || 1
|-
| || write back || → || 2
|}

In the case shown above, the final value is 2, as expected. However, if the two threads run simultaneously without locking or synchronization, the outcome of the operation could be wrong. The alternative sequence of operations below demonstrates this scenario:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Thread 1 !! Thread 2 !! !! Integer value
|-
|   ||   ||  || 0
|-
| read value ||   || ← || 0
|-
| || read value || ← || 0
|-
| style="background: wheat;" | increase value ||  ||  || 0
|-
| || style="background: wheat;" | increase value  ||  || 0
|-
| write back ||  || → || 1
|-
| || write back || → || 1
|}

In this case, the final value is 1 instead of the expected result of 2. This occurs because here the increment operations are not [[mutually exclusive]]. Mutually exclusive operations are those that cannot be interrupted while accessing some resource such as a memory location.

===Computer security===
Many software race conditions have associated [[computer security]] implications. A race condition allows an attacker with access to a shared resource to cause other actors that utilize that resource to malfunction, resulting in effects including [[Denial-of-service attack|denial of service]]&lt;ref name="CVE-2015-8461"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01319/0/CVE-2015-8461%3A-A-race-condition-when-handling-socket-errors-can-lead-to-an-assertion-failure-in-resolver.c.html|title=CVE-2015-8461: A race condition when handling socket errors can lead to an assertion failure in resolver.c|accessdate=5 June 2017|publisher=[[Internet Systems Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[privilege escalation]].&lt;ref name="CVE-2017-6512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lighttpd-issue-2724"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2724|publisher=[[lighttpd]]|accessdate=5 June 2017|title=security: stat cache *very large* race condition if caching when follow_symlink disabled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate (e.g. for [[authentication]]), then acting on the predicate, while the state can change between the ''time of check'' and the ''time of use''. When this kind of [[computer bug|bug]] exists in security-sensitive code, a [[security vulnerability]] called a [[time-of-check-to-time-of-use]] (''TOCTTOU'') bug is created.

Race conditions are also intentionally used to create [[hardware random number generator]]s and [[physically unclonable function]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} PUFs can be created by designing circuit topologies with identical paths to a node and relying on manufacturing variations to randomly determine which paths will complete first. By measuring each manufactured circuit's specific set of race condition outcomes, a profile can be collected for each circuit and kept secret in order to later verify a circuit's identity.

===File systems===
Two or more programs may collide in their attempts to modify or access a file system, which can result in data corruption or privilege escalation.&lt;ref name="CVE-2017-6512"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121951|accessdate=5 June 2017|title=Vulnerability in rmtree() and remove_tree(): CVE-2017-6512|publisher=[[CPAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File locking]] provides a commonly used solution. A more cumbersome remedy involves organizing the system in such a way that one unique process (running a [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] or the like) has exclusive access to the file, and all other processes that need to access the data in that file do so only via interprocess communication with that one process. This requires synchronization at the process level.

A different form of race condition exists in file systems where unrelated programs may affect each other by suddenly using up available resources such as disk space, memory space, or processor cycles. Software not carefully designed to anticipate and handle this race situation may then become unpredictable. Such a risk may be overlooked for a long time in a system that seems very reliable. But eventually enough data may accumulate or enough other software may be added to critically destabilize many parts of a system. An example of this occurred with the near loss of the [[Spirit (rover)#Sol 17 (January 21, 2004) flash memory management anomaly|Mars Rover "Spirit"]] not long after landing. A solution is for software to request and reserve all the resources it will need before beginning a task; if this request fails then the task is postponed, avoiding the many points where failure could have occurred. Alternatively, each of those points can be equipped with error handling, or the success of the entire task can be verified afterwards, before continuing. A more common approach is to simply verify that enough system resources are available before starting a task; however, this may not be adequate because in complex systems the actions of other running programs can be unpredictable.

===Networking===
In networking, consider a distributed chat network like [[IRC]], where a user who starts a channel automatically acquires channel-operator privileges. If two users on different servers, on different ends of the same network, try to start the same-named channel at the same time, each user's respective server will grant channel-operator privileges to each user, since neither server will yet have received the other server's signal that it has allocated that channel. (This problem has been largely [[Internet Relay Chat#Abuse prevention|solved]] by various IRC server implementations.)

In this case of a race condition, the concept of the "[[shared resource]]" covers the state of the network (what channels exist, as well as what users started them and therefore have what privileges), which each server can freely change as long as it signals the other servers on the network about the changes so that they can update their conception of the state of the network. However, the [[latency (engineering)|latency]] across the network makes possible the kind of race condition described. In this case, heading off race conditions by imposing a form of control over access to the shared resource—say, appointing one server to control who holds what privileges—would mean turning the distributed network into a centralized one (at least for that one part of the network operation).

Race conditions can also exist when a computer program is written with [[Berkeley sockets#Blocking vs. non-blocking mode|non-blocking sockets]], in which case the performance of the program can be dependent on the speed of the network link.

===Life-critical systems===
Software flaws in [[life-critical system]]s can be disastrous. Race conditions were among the flaws in the [[Therac-25]] [[radiation therapy]] machine, which led to the death of at least three patients and injuries to several more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3604/lib/Therac_25/Therac_1.html |title=An Investigation of Therac-25 Accidents — I |publisher=Courses.cs.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the Energy Management System provided by [[GE Energy]] and used by [[Ohio]]-based [[FirstEnergy Corp]] (among other power facilities). A race condition existed in the alarm subsystem; when three sagging power lines were tripped simultaneously, the condition prevented alerts from being raised to the monitoring technicians, delaying their awareness of the problem. This software flaw eventually led to the [[2003 North America blackout|North American Blackout of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8412 |title=Tracking the blackout bug |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=2004-04-07 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; GE Energy later developed a software patch to correct the previously undiscovered error.

==Examples outside of computing==

===Biology===
{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}

Neuroscience is demonstrating that race conditions can occur in mammal (rat) brains as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2013-08-03 |title=How Brains Race to Cancel Errant Movements |publisher=Discover Magazine blogs |url=https://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2013/08/03/the-race-to-stop-an-errant-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nn.3456|title= Canceling actions involves a race between basal ganglia pathways|year= 2013|last1= Schmidt|first1= Robert|last2= Leventhal|first2= Daniel K|last3= Mallet|first3= Nicolas|last4= Chen|first4= Fujun|last5= Berke|first5= Joshua D|journal= Nature Neuroscience|volume= 16|issue= 8|pages= 1118–24|pmid= 23852117|pmc= 3733500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

Many software tools exist to help detect race conditions in software. They can be largely categorized into two groups: [[static program analysis|static analysis]] tools and [[dynamic program analysis|dynamic analysis]] tools.

Thread Safety Analysis is a static analysis tool for annotation-based intra-procedural static analysis, originally implemented as a branch of gcc, and now reimplemented in [[Clang]], supporting PThreads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thread Safety Analysis|url=http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}}

Dynamic analysis tools include: [[Intel Inspector]], a memory and thread checking and debugging tool to increase the reliability, security, and accuracy of C/C++ and Fortran applications; [[Intel Advisor]], a sampling based, SIMD vectorization optimization and shared memory threading assistance tool for C, C++, C#, and Fortran software developers and architects; ThreadSanitizer, which uses binary ([[Valgrind]]-based) or source, [[LLVM]]-based instrumentation, and supports PThreads);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THREADSANITIZER|url=http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}} and Helgrind, a [[Valgrind]] tool for detecting synchronisation errors in C, C++ and Fortran programs that use the POSIX pthreads threading primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Helgrind: a thread error detector|url=http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2016}}

In [[computer science]], the '''scientific community metaphor''' is a [[metaphor]] used to aid understanding [[scientific community|scientific communities]].  The first publications on the scientific community metaphor in 1981 and 1982&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kornfeld]] and [[Carl Hewitt]] 1981, Kornfeld 1981, Kornfeld 1982&lt;/ref&gt; involved the development of a [[programming language]] named [[Ether (programming language)|Ether]] that invoked procedural plans to process goals and assertions concurrently by dynamically creating new rules during program execution.  Ether also addressed issues of conflict and contradiction with multiple sources of knowledge and multiple viewpoints.

==Development==
The scientific community metaphor builds on the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]], [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]].  It was originally developed building on work in the philosophy of science by [[Karl Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos]].  In particular, it initially made use of Lakatos' work on [[Imre Lakatos#Proofs and refutations|proofs and refutations]]. Subsequently, development has been influenced by the work of Geof Bowker, [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Susan Leigh Star]], [[Anselm Strauss]], and [[Lucy Suchman]].

In particular Latour's ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' had great influence.  In the book, [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] figures make paradoxical statements about scientific development.  An important challenge for the scientific community metaphor is to reconcile these paradoxical statements.

==Qualities of scientific research==
Scientific research depends critically on monotonicity, concurrency, commutativity, and pluralism to propose, modify, support, and oppose scientific methods, practices, and theories. 
Quoting from Carl Hewitt,{{Ref|hewitt-2006}} scientific community metaphor systems have characteristics of ''monotonicity'', ''concurrency'', ''commutativity'', ''pluralism'', ''skepticism'' and ''provenance''.

:'''monotonicity''': Once something is published it cannot be undone.  Scientists publish their results so they are available to all.  Published work is collected and indexed in libraries.  Scientists who change their mind can publish later articles contradicting earlier ones.

:'''concurrency''': Scientists can work concurrently, overlapping in time and interacting with each other.

:'''commutativity''': Publications can be read regardless of whether they initiate new research or become relevant to ongoing research.  Scientists who become interested in a scientific question typically make an effort to find out if the answer has already been published.  In addition they attempt to keep abreast of further developments as they continue their work.

:'''pluralism''': Publications include heterogeneous, overlapping and possibly conflicting information.  There is no central arbiter of truth in scientific communities.

:'''skepticism''': Great effort is expended to test and validate current information and replace it with better information.

:'''provenance''': The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded.

The above characteristics are limited in real scientific communities.  Publications are sometimes lost or difficult to retrieve.  Concurrency is limited by resources including personnel and funding.  Sometimes it is easier to rederive a result than to look it up.  Scientists only have so much time and energy to read and try to understand the literature.  Scientific fads sometimes sweep up almost everyone in a field.  The order in which information is received can influence how it is processed.  Sponsors can try to control scientific activities.  In Ether the semantics of the kinds of activity described in this paragraph are governed by the [[actor model]].

Scientific research includes generating theories and processes for modifying, supporting, and opposing these theories.  [[Karl Popper]] called the process "conjectures and refutations", which although expressing a core insight, has been shown to be too restrictive a characterization by the work of [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], [[George Lakoff]], [[Imre Lakatos]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Susan Leigh Star]], [[Anselm Strauss]], [[Lucy Suchman]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''etc.''.  Three basic kinds of participation in Ether are proposing, supporting, and opposing.  Scientific communities are structured to support competition as well as cooperation.

These activities affect the adherence to approaches, theories, methods, ''etc.'' in scientific communities.  Current adherence does not imply adherence for all future time.  Later developments will modify and extend current understandings.  Adherence is a local rather than a global phenomenon.  No one speaks for the scientific community as a whole.

Opposing ideas may coexist in communities for centuries.  On rare occasions a community reaches a ''breakthrough''  that clearly decides an issue previously muddled.

==Ether==
Ether used ''viewpoints'' to relativist information in publications.  However a great deal of information is shared across viewpoints.  So Ether made use of ''inheritance'' so that information in a viewpoint could be readily used in other viewpoints.  Sometimes this inheritance is not exact as when the laws of physics in [[Newtonian mechanics]] are derived from those of [[Special Relativity]].  In such cases Ether used ''translation'' instead of inheritance.  [[Bruno Latour]] has analyzed translation in scientific communities in the context of [[actor network theory]].  [[Imre Lakatos]] studied very sophisticated kinds of translations of mathematical (''e.g.'', the [[Euler]] formula for [[polyhedra]]) and scientific theories.

Viewpoints were used to implement natural deduction (Fitch [1952]) in Ether.  In order to prove a goal of the form &lt;tt&gt;(P ''implies'' Q)&lt;/tt&gt; in a viewpoint &lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;, it is sufficient to create a new viewpoint &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt; that inherits from &lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;, assert &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt;, and then prove &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt;.  An idea like this was originally introduced into programming language proving by Rulifson, Derksen, and Waldinger [1973] except since Ether is concurrent rather than being sequential it does not rely on being in a single viewpoint that can be sequentially pushed and popped to move to other viewpoints.

Ultimately resolving issues among these viewpoints are matters for [[negotiation]] (as studied in the sociology and philosophy of science by Geof Bowker, [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Karl Popper]], Susan Leigh Star, Anselm Strauss, Lucy Suchman, etc.).

==Emphasis on communities rather than individuals==
[[Alan Turing]] was one of the first to attempt to more precisely characterize ''individual'' intelligence through the notion of his famous [[Turing Test]].  This paradigm was developed and deepened in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]].  [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] did pioneer work in analyzing the protocols of individual human problem solving behavior on puzzles.  More recently [[Marvin Minsky]] has developed the idea that the mind of an individual human is composed of a society of agents in [[Society of Mind]] (see the analysis by Push Singh).

The above research on individual human problem solving is ''complementary'' to the scientific community metaphor.

== Current applications==
Some developments in hardware and software technology for the [[Internet]] are being applied in light of the scientific community metaphor.{{Ref|RepeatedDemise|Hewitt 2006|-}}

Legal concerns (''e.g.'', [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], "The Books and Records Rules"  in SEC Rule 17a-3/4 and  "Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications"  in  DOD 5015.2 in the [[United States|U.S.]]) are leading organizations to store information monotonically forever.  It has just now become less costly in many cases to store information on [[disk storage|magnetic disk]] than on tape.  With increasing storage capacity, sites can monotonically record what they read from the Internet as well as monotonically recording their own operations.

[[Search engines]] currently provide rudimentary access to all this information.  Future systems will provide [[question answering|interactive question answering broadly conceived]] that will make all this information much more useful.

Massive [[concurrent computing|concurrency]] (''i.e.,'' [[Web service]]s and [[multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] computer architectures) lies in the future posing enormous challenges and opportunities for the scientific community metaphor. In particular, the scientific community metaphor is being used in client [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4934 A historical perspective on developing foundations for privacy-friendly client cloud computing: the paradigm shift from “inconsistency denial” to “semantic integration”] ArXiv January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''serfdom in Tibet controversy''' rests on [[China|Chinese]] claims of [[moral authority]] for governing [[Tibet]], portraying Tibet as a "feudal serfdom" and a "hell on earth" prior to its [[Invasion of Tibet (1950)|invasion in 1950]].&lt;ref name="Powers 122"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Claims of [[unfree labour]] practices have been a recurrent theme, covering periods both before and after the Chinese takeover. Supporters of the Chinese position highlight statements by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that, prior to 1959, 95% of Tibetans lived in "feudal serfdom",&lt;ref name="white" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/features/Tibetpaper/tb1.html|title=White Paper on Tibet's March Forward|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cite cases of abuse and cruelty in the traditional Tibetan system.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199756"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Western responses have tended to attempt to discredit the Chinese claims as part of an effort to discredit the takeover of Tibet.

== The idea of Tibet and the concept of serfdom ==

One of the central points of contention in the debate about labour and human rights in the historical region of Tibet before and after its incorporation into the modern state of the People's Republic of China is the very definition of Tibet and serfdom itself, with some scholars claiming that the debate is framed around [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric]] and [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] ideas about statehood and society which are projected onto the history of the area in a way that distorts understanding. Some western scholars reject claims of "serfdom in Tibet" outright based on the view that "Tibet" cannot be defined as one political entity or [[social system]]; its political and [[socioeconomic]] structures have varied greatly over time and between sub-districts. The various polities comprising Tibet have changed significantly over the past 2,000 years, and even during the modern period there have been dramatic changes in what Tibet is, as anthropologist Geoff Childs writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Tibet] has undergone numerous political transformations from a unified empire (640–842) incorporating parts of what are now Nepal, India, Pakistan, and several provinces of China (Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan), to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (842–1248), to protectorate under the power of an expanding Mongol empire (1248–1368), back to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (1368–1642), to a centralized state under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1642–1720), to a protectorate of the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1720–1911), and finally to a nation having de facto independence under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1911–1951)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Geoff|date=2003|title=Polyandry and population growth in a historical Tibetan society|url=http://case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/childs.polyandry.and.population.growth.pdf|journal=The History of the Family|volume=8|pages=423–444|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although  the central leadership in [[Lhasa]] had authority of these areas for various periods, some Western writers claim that this did not imply the kind of political control of modern Western states. According to [[Luciano Petech]], "K'ams [the [[Kham]] region, largely synonymous with the province of XIkang which was abolished in 1950] was practically independent of Lhasa under its great lamas"  in the 18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Petech 5198"&gt;Petech 1973, pp. 51, 98&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the areas of [[Qinghai]] with large Tibetan populations were not continuously ruled by Lhasa, including in the period leading up to the establishment of the PRC (in the late 1930s and 1940s) when the [[Kuomintang]] Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled Qinghai within the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+son&amp;q=genocidal#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20chairmen%20lords%20and%20slaves&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=54|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[definitions of Tibet|definition of Tibet]] has been contested with a map of competing claims identifying six distinct types of Tibetan regions claimed by various entities. In the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912) and in the ROC (1912-1949), the part of Tibet governed by Lhasa was limited to the modern [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], and did not include the Kham ([[Xikang Province|Xikang) Province]] of China. Meanwhile, the western part of Xikang (i.e. [[Qamdo, Tibet|Qamdo]]) and [[Qinghai]] was only occupied by Lhasa in the Tibet-Kham War which lasted from the 1910s to 1930s.

Generally, the government of the PRC also limits Tibet to the area it has designated the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], consisting of the traditional areas of Ü, Tsang, [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]], along with Qamdo (i.e. the western Kham/Xikang) which was legally incorporated into the TAR when Xikang Province was abolished by the [[National People's Congress|NPC]] in 1955. The Tibetan government in exile claims that other ethnically Tibetan areas to the east and to the north also belong to Tibet, i.e. "[[Greater Tibet]]". These areas now respectively belong to Qinghai Province, [[Gansu Province]], [[Sichuan Province]] and [[Yunnan Province]] of China.&lt;ref name="Powers 163"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhanghao"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Zhang |first1=Hao (张皓) |script-title=zh:1931年中国内部各方关于康藏冲突的协商 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|西北民族大学学报(哲学社会科学版)}}' ([[Northwest University for Nationalities]] university paper |year=2015 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaobin (王小彬) |script-title=zh:“中华人民共和国昌都地区人民解放委员会”隶属关系的历史沿革 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|中国藏学}}'' [China Tibetology] |year=2010 |issue=3 |page=41&amp;ndash;47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholarship frequently represents a limited survey, restricted to the central region of Tibet, and may not accurately represent the whole of cultural Tibet or all Tibetan speaking peoples.

Discussing the [[Social classes of Tibet|social structure of Tibet]] inevitably leads to difficulties with defining terms. Not only may [[serf]] and [[feudalism]] be Western terms inappropriate for Asian use but the geography and peoples of Tibet vary according to interpreter. The lack of agreement of the various sides as to terminology highlights that the "serfdom in Tibet" controversy is a politicised debate, with the term "feudal serfdom" largely being used by the People's Republic of China as a justification for their taking control of Tibet. According to the PRC:&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was a historically imperative need for the progress of Tibetan society and the welfare of the Tibetan people to expel the imperialists and shake off the yoke of feudal serfdom. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring about Tibet's peaceful liberation. After that, important policies and measures were adopted for Tibet's Democratic Reform, regional autonomy, large-scale modernization and reform and opening-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|title=Tibet's March Toward Modernization|year=2001|publisher=People's Republic of China|accessdate=2008-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222305/http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the Tibetan government in exile responds: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Chinese justifications make no sense. First of all, international law does not accept justifications of this type. No country is allowed to invade, occupy, annex and colonize another country just because its social structure does not please it. Secondly, the PRC is responsible for bringing more suffering in the name of liberation. Thirdly, necessary reforms were initiated and Tibetans are quite capable of doing so.&lt;ref name="tibet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html|title=Traditional society and democratic framework for future Tibet  |year=1996|publisher=Tibetan Government-in-Exile|accessdate=2008-07-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410151700/http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Competing versions of Tibetan history==
It is difficult to find academic consensus on the nature of society in Tibetan history. Sources on the [[history of Tibet]] are available from both pro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan writers.

Pro-Chinese materials may be published by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China. Tibetan materials, similarly, may be published by mainstream Western printers, or by the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]]. Both sides hope to persuade foreign readers to support their own point of view through these publications.&lt;ref name="Powers6 7"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the pro-Chinese works in English on the subject were translated from Chinese. Translators are not named, but censors are.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Asian studies scholar John Powers concludes that ideology was the most powerful influence on the translations: "In contemporary China, the Communist Party strictly controls the presentation of history, and several formal resolutions have been issued by the Central Committee, which are intended to guide historians in the "correct" interpretation of historical events and actors." &lt;ref name="Powers 12"&gt;Powers 2004, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The writings of contemporary Chinese historians conform to [[Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine, which asserts that societies progress from primitive communism, to slave societies, which are then overthrown and replaced by feudalism, which are in their turn overthrown and replaced by capitalism, which is followed - via rebellion, again - by socialism, which may progress peacefully toward communism. Several Chinese sources insert peasant rebellions into their accounts of Tibetan history, to achieve conformity with this structure required by political [[dogma]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Historians in China are prevented from performing research that could challenge orthodoxy. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Marx]] condemned religion as "the opiate of the masses", and this doctrine is also infused in Chinese writings on history.&lt;ref name="Powers 12 14"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with their political perspectives, Chinese sources claim that the common Tibetans suffered appallingly before the Chinese takeover.&lt;ref name="Powers19 20"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Western authors' writings on Tibetan history are sometimes controversial. For example, whilst Hugh Richardson, who lived in Lhasa in the 1930s and 1940s, before the takeover by the PRC in 1951, writes in ''Tibet and Its History'' that Chinese versions of Tibetan history are contemptible and he considers the Chinese rule brutal and illegal,&lt;ref name="Powers 16"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Israel Epstein]], a naturalized Chinese citizen born in Poland  who similarly claims the authority of first-hand knowledge, although following the Chinese takeover, supports Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers 17 18"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; There are few academic assessments of the recent history of Tibet. Anthropologist and historian [[Melvyn Goldstein]], who is fluent in Tibetan and has done considerable fieldwork with Tibetans in exile and in Tibet, considers pre-1950 Tibet to have been a feudal theocracy impaired by corrupt and incompetent leaders.&lt;ref name="Powers 21"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It was ''de facto'' independent of China from 1911 to 1949, but not recognised as ''de jure'' independent of China by any nation, including its protective power Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1989, ps. 815-824&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese side seeks to persuade international perception as to the appropriate nature and justifiability of Chinese rule in Tibet. Their position is that Tibet truly and historically belongs to China, that affairs of Tibet are internal matters, and Tibetans seek to internationalize their cause, in part by convincing readers that Tibet was independent.&lt;ref name="Powers 8"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating as it does on questions of national sovereignty, the official position of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] is more moderate in tone than that of some of its more extreme supporters who conflate the rule of the lamas with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] ideals, seeking to promote a Buddhist dogma that competes with the Marxist dogma of "feudal serfdom" by portraying Tibet under the [[lama]]s as, in [[Robert Thurman]]'s words: "a mandala of the peaceful, perfected universe".&lt;ref&gt;Inner Revolution: Robert Thurman&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetologist Robert Barnett&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/faculty/barnett.html|title=The Faculty and Scholars of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute: Robert J. Barnett|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

:"Chinese references to preliberation conditions in Tibet thus appear to be aimed at creating popular support for Beijing's project in Tibet. These claims have particular resonance among people who share the assumption—based on nineteenth-century Western theories of "social evolution" that are still widely accepted in China—that certain forms of society are "backward" and should be helped to evolve by more "advanced" societies. This form of prejudice converges with some earlier Chinese views and with vulgar Marxist theories that imagine a vanguard movement liberating the oppressed classes or nationalities in a society, whether or not those classes agree that they are oppressed. Moreover, the Chinese have to present that oppression as very extensive, and that society as very primitive, in order to explain why there were no calls by the Tibetan peasantry for Chinese intervention on their behalf.

:The question of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims in this respect are intrinsic to the functioning of the PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with caution. From a human rights point of view, the question of whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate question is why the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive. Writers and researchers in Tibet face serious repercussions if they do not concur with official positions on issues such as social conditions in Tibet prior to its "liberation," and in such a restrictive climate, the regime's claims on this issue have little credibility."&lt;ref name="barnett84"&gt;Barnett 2008, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===The political debate===
Chinese sources portray Tibet before 1950 as a feudal serfdom in which serfs suffered terribly under the despotic rule of [[lama]]s and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. Some Tibetan sources describe the people as happy, content, and devoted to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Powers18 19"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand the Tibetan [[Phuntsok Wangyal]], who founded the Tibetan communist party in the 40's, describes the old system as unequal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, and Siebenschuh 2004, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest publications in English to apply the term "serf" to Tibet was [[Marxist]] sympathiser [[Anna Louise Strong]]'s work from 1960, ''When Serfs Stood up in Tibet'', published by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="Powers 167"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Another seminal promoter of the term is historian&lt;ref name="nych"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyhumanities.org/speakers/adult_audiences/speaker.php?speaker_id=223|title=A.

[[Melvyn Goldstein]] has produced many works on Tibetan society since the 1960s and used "serf" to translate the Tibetan term ''mi ser'' (literally "yellow person";&lt;ref name="Powers 168"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as peasant"&lt;ref name="wmc4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to describe both the landless peasant classes and the wealthier land holding and taxpaying class of families. He has written, "with the exception of about 300 noble families, all laymen and laywomen in Tibet were serfs (''Mi ser'') bound via ascription by parallel descent to a particular lord (dPon-po) though an estate, in other words sons were ascribed to their father's lord but daughters to their mother's lord."&lt;ref name="CAJ7115"&gt;Goldstein, Central Asiatic Journal, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1989 book ''A History of Modern Tibet'' Goldstein argued that although serfdom was prevalent in Tibet, this did not mean that it was an entirely static society. There were several types of serf sub-status, of which one of the most important was the "human lease", which enabled a serf to acquire a degree of personal freedom. This was an alternative which, despite retaining the concept of lordship, partially freed the ''mi ser'' from obligations to a landed estate, usually for an annual fee.&lt;ref name="Goldstein JAS7152134"&gt;Goldstein, ''Journal of Asian Studies'', May 1971, pp. 521-34&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Goldstein used the term "serf" in the following, more cautious, way "...monastic and aristocratic elites ... held most of the land in Tibet in the form of feudal estates with hereditarily bound serflike peasants."&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199735"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Powers has characterized Goldstein as "generally pro-China"&lt;ref name="Powers 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but also called his ''History of Modern Tibet'' "the most balanced treatment".&lt;ref name="Powers 17"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein describes himself as having conservative political views.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to WTN by Goldstein July 2008, quoted on http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=22134&amp;article=Goldstein's+Response+to+Jamyang+Norbu.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to William Monroe Coleman, China misrepresents Goldstein's usage as support for their version of Tibetan history.&lt;ref name="wmc4"/&gt;

Goldstein distinguished serfdom from feudalism, and applied the term "serfdom" but not "feudalism" to old Tibet.&lt;ref name="wmc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he made some effort to avoid appearing to support China's invasion of Tibet, writing that the PRC left the traditional system in place, not only after the invasion of 1950, but even after the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959.  He pointed out that in 1950, Chinese rhetoric claimed that China was freeing Tibet, not from serfdom, but from imperialist influence.&lt;ref name="exchoice109"&gt;Goldstein, "Reexamining Choice" (1986), pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, his usage has been misinterpreted as support for the Chinese Marxist viewpoint, in which feudalism and serfdom are inseparable, and old Tibet is consistently described as "feudal serfdom".&lt;ref name="wmc11"/&gt;

Not all writers who use the term "serfdom" to describe pre-Communist society in Tibet do so pejoratively. [[Pico Iyer]], a journalist whose father is a friend of the Dalai Lama and who has himself been in private conversation with him for over thirty years writes: "Almost as soon as he came into exile, in 1959, the Dalai Lama seized the chance to get rid of much of the red tape and serfdom that had beset Tibet in the past".&lt;ref name="Iyer 176"&gt;Iyer 2008, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama himself used the term "serf" in 1991, saying: "The relationship between landlord and serf was much milder in Tibet than in China and conditions for the poor were much less harsh."&lt;ref&gt;Freedom in Exile, HHDL 1991. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Tibetan sources portray Tibetan peasants and workers to support their own view of a Tibetan people who were not only independent of China, but found the Chinese alien and incomprehensible, and who suffered genocide under Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers9 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]], the British Trade Envoy to Tibet in the 1940s, agrees with Tibetan authors, stating there was little difference between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref name="Powers22"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Thomas Laird notes that scholars debate the applicability of these terms to Tibet, and struggle with a lack of sufficient data.&lt;ref name="Laird 3179"&gt;Laird 2006, pp.317-9&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Barbara Crossette asserted in 1998 that "scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Crossette 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government-in-Exile says about conditions in Tibet pre-Communism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Traditional Tibetan society was, by no means, perfect and was in need of changes. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders have admitted as much. That is the reason why the Dalai Lama initiated far-reaching reforms in Tibet as soon as he assumed temporal authority. The traditional Tibetan society, however, was not nearly as bad as China would have us believe.
&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The academic debate===
The academic debate as to whether "serf" is an applicable term for a society such as pre-Communist Tibet continues to this day. Goldstein and Miller's exchanges in an academic journal between 1986 and 1989 were a notable part of this debate. The applicability of the concept of serfdom to Tibet was debated between Melvyn Goldstein and anthropologist Beatrice D. Miller of Wisconsin University over a series of five articles in the ''Tibet Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/social.htm|title=Tibetan History and Social &amp; Political Structure|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was initiated by Goldstein in the XI edition of the ''Tibet Journal'', in which he defended his description of the features of Tibetan society as being very comparable to European serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) pp.80-86&lt;/ref&gt; He based the comparison on the features of serfdom described by French historian Marc Bloch including:&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

* The status was hereditary.
* A serf, unlike a slave, had rights and possessed but did not own productive resources (land).
* The lord had the legal right to command his serfs, including judicial authority over him or her.

Goldstein argued that Tibetan society fulfilled all these requirements, and argued in detail against the specific diverging opinions of fellow scholars Miller, Micheal, Dargyay and Aziz. He underpinned his assertions by research, first hand accounts and case studies, and responded to criticisms which had been voiced by these researchers in the preceding years.

Only Miller responded in the next ''The Tibet Journal'', in a short letter, in 1987. She acknowledged Goldstein's scholarship, stating "Goldstein's article ... cannot be faulted. It is an outstanding example of his exemplary collection of fine data."&lt;ref name="miller65"&gt;Miller (1987) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed however with his interpretation, specifically the use of the word "serf" and challenged him by asserting the following:

* That a lord also had obligations to the central government, so the specific obligations of a peasant (Tibetan: "mi ser") to a lord were only examples of societal obligations which everyone had.&lt;ref name="miller65" /&gt;
* That the obligations owed to a lord were by the family collective, and not "personal" or individual.&lt;ref name="miller66"&gt;Miller (1987) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the obligations of a peasant were not so onerous as it was easy to run away.&lt;ref name="miller66-67"&gt;Miller (1987) pp.66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following issue Goldstein replied in brief arguing:

* The nature of the lord's relation with the central government was radically different from the peasant/lord relation and not relevant to the peasant/lord relation he was discussing.
* While corvee obligations fell primarily on households, a peasant's legal status very much related to his person, was hereditary and not rescindable.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
* He pointed out that running away was illegal, punishable, and that European serfs also ran away.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;
* He strongly disagreed with Miller's assertion that the peasant/lord relation was fundamentally contractual.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later publication and response Goldstein agreed to differ on the use of the word "serf" to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the form of partial manumission known as "human lease" and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not occasional service at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) pp.56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman, integrating Goldstein's research with subsequent work done by other scholars including Rebecca French, Graham Clarke, and Franz Michael, argues that Goldstein overemphasized the ''de jure'' status of the ''mi ser'' at the expense of ''de facto'' characteristics - a high degree of social and economic mobility, and hence autonomy; frequently successful negotiations with lords to improve their status; and flight from untenable situations such as unpayable debts and exorbitant labor requirements.&lt;ref name="wmc710"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that "serf" is a misleading term for the Tibetan ''mi ser''.&lt;ref name="wmc2022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights in Tibet==
{{Main|Human rights in Tibet}}
In the political debate regarding the nature of pre-Communist Tibet, Chinese sources assert [[human rights]] abuses as a justification for the Communist invasion. Both before and after the Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]]. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified.

===Prior to 1950===
Judicial mutilation - principally the gouging out of eyes, and the cutting off of hands or feet - was formalized under the [[Sakya]] school as part of the 13th century Tibetan legal code, and was used as a legal punishment until being declared illegal in 1913 by a proclamation of the [[13th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Barnett 2008, pp. 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; In this same reform, the Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so (preceding, for instance, Switzerland, Britain, and France).&lt;ref name="acme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamyangnorbu.com/blog/2008/08/17/acme-of-obscenity/|title=Acme of Obscenity|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 14th Dalai Lama's brother Jigme Norbu reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."&lt;ref name="Norbu 317"&gt;Norbu 1968, pg. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 244"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert W. Ford]], one of the few Westerners to have been appointed by the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Government of Tibet]] at the time of ''de facto'' [[Tibet (1912–1951)|independent Tibet]], spent five years in Tibet, from 1945 to 1950, before his arrest by the invading Chinese army. In his book ''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'', he writes

{{quote|"All over Tibet I had seen men who had been deprived of an arm or a leg for theft (...) Penal amputations were done without antiseptics or sterile dressings".&lt;ref&gt;''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'' by [[Robert W. Ford]] (1957), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Heinrich Harrer]] who lived in Tibet at the same time (1944 to 1951) wrote in his book "Return to Tibet" that these treatments had already ceased at that time:
{{quote|"The so-called "chamber of horrors" at the foot of the Potala is also no longer shown. I believe that the Chinese were perfectly well aware that they were conning the tourists with displays of desiccated human arms, flutes made from femurs, and silver-mounted skulls; these objects, they used to maintain, testified to torture, flogging and other atrocities. Even Wangdu was so much under Chinese influence that he confirmed the atrocity stories spread by the Chinese about the Tibetans. He reminded me that in the days of the fifth Dalai Lama (in the eighteenth century), and even under the thirteenth (1900- 33), Tibetans still had their hands and feet chopped off. In reply to my direct question he had to admit that this had ceased to happen during my time in Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Tibet'' by [[Heinrich Harrer]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, mutilation and other extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official [[Lungshar]] in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon [[Lungshar]], an official educated in England, introduced reform in the 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. "The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone on each of the temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to cauterize the wound." &lt;ref name="Lee Feigon"&gt;Demystifying Tibet: unlocking the secrets of the Land of the Snows pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldHist208"&gt;A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (''ragyaba'') carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.&lt;ref name="GoldHist208" /&gt;

As late as 1949 the Tibetan government still sentenced people to mutilation. When an CIA officer [[Douglas Mackiernan]] was killed against official entry permit, six Tibetan border guards were tried and sentenced in Lhasa. "The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each." The sentence was reduced to 200, 50 and 25 lashes, respectively, after another CIA agent [[Frank Bessac]] requested leniency.&lt;ref name="These Tibetans killed an American"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frank Bessac]]|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131| date=13 November 1950|publisher=Time Inc|pages=131–141|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping was legal and common as punishment&lt;ref&gt;French (1995) pp. 276, 316, 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process. Whipping could also have fatal consequences, as in the case of the trader Gyebo Sherpa subjected to the severe ''corca'' whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 1989 p163&lt;/ref&gt; Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997 pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ''100 Questions and Answers About Tibet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|title=100 Questions and Answers About Tibet|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|accessdate=2008-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331121008/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|archive-date=2006-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China]] states that [[human rights]] were 'severely infringed upon' by the [[Dalai Lama]]'s administration. The evidence for these accusations is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Robert, in: Blondeau, Anne-Marie and  Buffetrille, Katia (eds).  ''Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions''  (2008) University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24464-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-520-24928-8}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed criminal offenses as uncommon, but there are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes.&lt;ref name="French315"&gt;French (1995) p.315-316&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more likely to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.&lt;ref name="French315" /&gt;

Political power could play a role in a judicial process in Tibet. In the eye gouging case above the alleged criminal was a deposed member of the Kashag called Lungshar who had proposed democratic reform. The charge was planning a coup and the attempted murder of another Kashag member who opposed reform. It was strenuously denied by the accused. Conviction was based on the evidence of one informer who claimed to have seen a document which was never produced. He was richly rewarded, and the trial seems to have been a show trial by traditionalists seeking to prevent reform. From arrest to execution of the sentence was only ten days, limiting the possibilities of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, pp. 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

One evidence of Chinese brutality in Eastern Tibet was reported by an American missionary in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these Tibetans, slicing, boiling, tearing asunder and all …To sum up what China is doing here in eastern Tibet, the main things are collecting taxes, robbing, oppressing, confiscating, and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Believing that the American missionary's account might be a mistake, Sir Eric Teichman, a British diplomat, noted that whatever brutality existed, it was "in no way due to any action of the Chinese government in Peking or the provincial authorities in Szechuana."&lt;ref name="Teichman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Teichman|title=Travels of a Consular Officer in Eastern Tibet: Together with a History of the Relations Between China, Tibet and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA228|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Archive|page=228|id=GGKEY:C7S43JE1DN6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
[[Israel Epstein]] wrote that prior to the Communist takeover, poverty in Tibet was so severe that in some of the worst cases peasants had to hand over children to the manor as household slaves or [[nangzan]], because they were too poor to raise them.&lt;ref name="Laird 46"&gt;Epstein 1983, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Laird asserted that in the 1940s Tibetan peasants were well off and immune to famine, whereas starvation was common in China.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, the so-called "slaves" were domestic servants (nangtsen) and managers of estates in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://savetibet.ru/img/2010/tibet-book-eng.pdf Kuzmin, S.L. ''Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation''. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 the British army invaded and held the Tibetan [[Chumbi Valley]], in the border region adjacent to Bhutan and India. [[Charles Alfred Bell|Sir Charles Bell]] was put in charge of the district from September 1904 to November 1905&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pg. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby [[Bhutan]] where [[slavery in Bhutan|slavery was more widespread]]. Bell further remarked, "The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into [[Sikkim]] and [[British Raj|British India]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan welfare after the Chinese takeover===
Just as the Chinese and the Tibetan exile community argue over whether common Tibetans suffered or flourished before the Chinese takeover, they take diametrically opposing views on the fate of ordinary Tibetans since 1950.  This is understood to be highly important in persuading readers of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Chinese rule.  Chinese sources in English claim rapid progress for prosperous, free, and happy Tibetans participating in democratic reforms. Tibetans, on the other hand, write of Chinese genocide in Tibet, comparing the Chinese to the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Powers11 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cultural Revolution]], according to Powers, scholar Warren Smith, whose work became focused on Tibetan history and politics after spending five months in Tibet in 1982, portrays the Chinese as chauvinists who believe they are superior to the Tibetans, and claims that the Chinese use torture, coercion and starvation to control the Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Powers23 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibet Autonomous Region is much poorer than other provinces of China. In 1980, in order to help Tibet out of poverty, the 1st Tibet Work Forum (moderated by [[Hu Yaobang]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]), decided to give the Tibet Autonomous Region financial support, in order to build a "united, prosperous, civilized new Tibet". After this Forum, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, all taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry were waived, while other provinces had to wait until 2006 for the same. The old “[[people's commune]]” economic system was dismantled (while in other provinces it was ended in 1985), so farmland started to be used by the household, and livestock started to be owned and used by the household. In the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial level administrative region that enjoys some tax incentives, and after 1988 is the only provincial level administrative region that receives growing substantial quota subsidies from the central government. Under the "partner assistance" policy, all the rich provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, most of the Central Government organs, and some central enterprises respectively assist the prefectures and cities of the Tibet Autonomous Region. With this assistance, in 1988, the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminated its fiscal deficit for the first time in history. As the only provincial level "poverty-stricken areas which lie in vast, contiguous stretches" in the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region developed a lot of anti-poverty programs, and the impoverished population has been shrinking substantially. However, there are still many difficulties in poverty reduction.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-hans|罗绒战堆, 西藏的贫困与反贫困问题研究, 中国藏学出版社}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of 2012, the social security system in the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completely established. This system not only includes ordinary people, but also all the 29,000 monks and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism in the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://xw.sinoins.com/2013-12/17/content_82593.htm|script-title=zh:西藏2.9万在编僧尼全部纳入社会保障体系|date=2013-12-17|publisher=中国保险报·中保网|accessdate=2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of human rights infringements, including the 2006 [[Nangpa La shootings]]. See [[human rights in the People's Republic of China]] and [[Human rights in Tibet]] (include all the Tibetan areas) for an overview. The ''Human Rights Watch World Report 2008: Events in China 2007'' states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Widespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged "separatism." Seven Tibetan boys in [[Gansu Province|Gansu province]] were detained for over a month in early September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet. Ronggyal Adrak was detained and charged under state security offenses by police on August 1 after he called for the Dalai Lama's return at a horse race festival in [[Sichuan Province|Sichuan province]]. He is awaiting trial. The Chinese government has failed to bring to justice those responsible for the shooting death by People's Armed Police officers of a 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, while trying to cross the border into Nepal on September 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.hrw.org/press/other_news/hrw_world_report_2008_events_in_china_in_2007|title=Overview of key developments relating to human rights in China in 2007|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is notable in this Report that most of the examples are not in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the "[[reform and opening up]]" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support policies and substantial financial support to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan areas in the four provinces did not get the same. Although some of them (such as the [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan) are rich enough, others of them are not rich, and some of them in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai are poor enough. The Tibetan areas in the four provinces ask the central government to benefit them as the Tibet Autonomous Region. And the poverty in these areas makes some of their Tibetan residents support the idea of "[[Greater Tibet]]" which is claimed by Tibetan exile groups.&lt;ref name=you&gt;尤力, 杨明洪, [http://www.scfpym.gov.cn/show.aspx?id=32294 新形势下西藏与四省藏区协调发展基点研究], 西南民族大学学报(人文社会科学版) 2014年09期&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;廖桂蓉, [http://www.sass.cn/109005/19679.aspx 四川藏区贫困状况及脱贫障碍分析], 农村经济2014年第1期&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, on the 5th Tibet Work Forum, the central government declared its intention to make the Tibetan areas in the four provinces steadily progress as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region. The goal is to bring the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan areas in the four provinces in line together with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way in 2020.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;

==Comparison to other regions==

Debate continues as to whether pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: "In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries"&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt; the fact that most [[Dalai Lama]]s, including [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] and [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]], came from [[peasant]] families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to be far better off than their Chinese counterparts.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo, Nicola, State Formation and Periodization in ''Inner Asian History Journal of World History'' - Volume 10, Number 1, Spring 1999, pp. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; Much of [[Mongolia]]n, [[Tibetan history|Tibetan]] and [[History of China|Chinese]] political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain.

According to the 'United Nations Research Institute for Social  Development', [[Bonded labour|bonded labor]] and other forms of economic exploitation currently exist in nearby regions including India, Nepal, and {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}several Chinese provinces.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development. [http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/B4D9538DE438A5F3C1256BB900324E59/$file/shah.pdf ''Layers of Silence:Links between women's vulnerability, trafficking and HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh, India and Nepal''] Draft paper, 2002.

According to the U.S. Dept of State "Trafficking in Persons Report 2008"&lt;ref name="DOSReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/|title=US Dept. of State:Trafficking in Persons Report 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Pakistan]] are all Tier 2 countries, with China and India both on the Tier 2 watchlist. However no local regions are in Tier 3.

Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Simplified sewerage''', also called '''small-bore sewerage''', is a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] system that collects all household [[wastewater]] ([[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and [[greywater]]) in small-diameter pipes laid at fairly flat [[gradient]]s. Simplified sewers are laid in the front yard or under the pavement (sidewalk) or - if feasible - inside the back yard, rather than in the centre of the road as with conventional sewerage. It is suitable for existing unplanned low-income areas, as well as new housing estates with a regular layout.&lt;ref name="Mara"&gt;[http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~cen6ddm/simpsewdesman.html Simplified Sewerage Design Manual, Duncan Mara, Leeds University]&lt;/ref&gt; It allows for a more flexible design.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; With simplified sewerage it is crucial to have management arrangements in place to remove blockages, which are more frequent than with conventional sewers. It has been estimated that simplified sewerage reduces investment costs by ''up to'' 50% compared to conventional sewerage.

Simplified sewerage is sometimes also referred to as conventional sewerage with appropriate standards, implying that most conventional sewers are overdesigned.

The concept of simplified sewerage emerged in parallel in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Water supply and sanitation in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Karachi]], Pakistan in the early 1980s without any interaction or communication.
In both cases particular emphasis was given to community mobilization, an  essential element for the success of simplified sewerage. In Latin America, and particularly in Brazil, simplified sewerage is also known as [[condominial sewerage]], a term that undercores the importance of community participation in planning and maintenance at the level of a housing block (known as ''condominio'' in the Spanish and Portuguese use of the term).

== Background ==
In developing countries, connection to sewer systems is often costly for poor households, despite typically low monthly sewer tariffs. This apparent paradox is explained by the high costs of in-plot and in-house sanitary installations that have to be paid entirely by the user, by sometimes high sewer connection fees levied by utilities, and by a lack of community consultation. As a result, in many cities in developing countries conventional sewers are laid at high costs under a street, while many users on that street do not connect to them. In Brazil, in some cities connection rates in the early 1990s were less than 40% of the intended beneficiary population.&lt;ref&gt;*Gabrielle Watson: Good Sewers Cheap? Agency-Customer Interactions in Low-Cost Urban Sanitation in Brazil, The World Bank, 1995, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

Simplified sewerage is most widely used in [[Water supply and sanitation in Brazil|Brazil]]. It is estimated that in Brazil some 5 million people in over 200 towns and cities are served with simplified sewerage - or condominial sewerage.&lt;ref name="Melo"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/filez/pubs/1172007103934_Condominial_Advocacy_Document.pdf Jose Carlos Melo: La ciudad y el saneamiento, 2007]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to about 3% of the population of Brazil and about 6% of the population connected to sewers. They serve poor and rich alike.

Simplified sewerage has also been used in

* in Sri Lanka, where the National Housing Development Authority implemented over 20 schemes in the 1980s and 90s.

In [[Pakistan]], beginning with the [[Orangi Pilot Project]] in [[Karachi]], a variation of simplified sewerage using larger diameter pipes has been used.

== Community participation ==
Community participation in the planning of any sewer system is a fundamental requirement to achieve higher household connection rates and to increase the likelihood of proper maintenance of in-block sewers. In addition, it can motivate users to assume parts of the costs of the sewer system that they are able to assume, such as contribution of labor for construction and/or maintenance.

Typically, in the planning process for a simplified sewerage system,  meetings are carried out at the housing block (''condominio'') level for information, discussions and clarifications required for a joint group decision on network design, community contributions during construction and maintenance responsibilities. Users might finance and implement in-house sanitary installations and household connections and would agree on a suitable type of condominial branch. They are asked to comply with agreements established for construction and operation of the condominial branch, as well as payment of tariffs. In turn, the service provider agrees to fulfill his responsibilities as established in the “Terms of Connection ” between the parties.&lt;ref name="Melo"/&gt;
The community participation process also provides a good opportunity for complementary actions like [[hygiene]] promotion, which can have a significant impact on public health at a relatively limited cost.

== Design and construction ==
Simplified sewers are usually laid in the front yard or under the pavement (sidewalk). In some rare cases it is possible to lay them in the back yard.&lt;ref&gt;In Brazil this has apparently been done in 10% of the cases, according to a communication by Klaus Neder&lt;/ref&gt; Sidewalk branches are usually preferred in regular urbanizations, while the front and back yard branches are particularly suited to neighborhoods with challenging topography or urbanization patterns. However, in some cases neither of these options is possible. For example, in South Asia, in many cities there is no sidewalk or front yard, so pipes have to be laid in the middle of the street as with conventional sewers.&lt;ref&gt;Communication from Kevin Tayler&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America typical simplified sewer diameters are 100&amp;nbsp;mm, laid at a gradient of 1 in 200 (0.5 percent). Such a sewer will serve around 200 households of 5 people with a wastewater flow of 80 litres per person per day. In Pakistan, however, there are no rigorous standards for sewer diameters. In a small pilot as part of the [[Orangi Pilot Project]] pipes with a diameter of 150mm were used.&lt;ref&gt;Communication by Kevin Tayler&lt;/ref&gt;

Laying small diameter pipes at fairly flat gradients requires careful construction techniques. Plastic pipes are best used as they are more easily jointed correctly. This reduces wastewater leakage from the sewer and groundwater infiltration into it. With simplified sewerage there is no need to have the large expensive manholes of the type used for conventional sewerage — simple brick or plastic junction chambers are used instead.&lt;ref name="Mara"/&gt;

Construction can be carried out by contractors or by trained and properly supervised community members. Training and proper supervision are actually needed in both cases, since contractors in many cities are not familiar with simplified sewerage.

== Investment cost comparison ==
The cost of sewerage - conventional or simplified - are always site-specific, and estimates are subject to controversies. Construction costs of simplified sewerage are ''up to'' half the costs of conventional sewerage. Investment cost savings come from various design features that may or may not be present in a particular simplified sewerage system. Cost-saving features of any simplified sewerage system are a smaller diameter of pipes, smaller and shallower trenches and simplified manholes. The two latter features are estimated to account for most of the cost savings. Other features that could further reduce costs may only be present in some systems, such as:

* shorter networks;
* avoidance of the need to damage pavements and sidewalks (if they already exist and if pipes are laid in front or back yards);
* decentralized, small-scale wastewater treatment, and consequently elimination of main collectors and sewage pumping stations.

An element that may slightly increase costs compared to conventional sewerage is the introduction of grease traps or of interceptor chambers for the settlement of sludge. The latter are more common in South Asia and are not used in the condominial model. A 2006 study of four countries showed cost savings of 31-57% from the use of simplified sewerage compared to conventional sewerage with unit costs varying from US$119 per connection in a neighborhood in Bolivia and to US$759 per connection in a small town in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~cen6ddm/SimpSew/s4.pdf Miguel Vargas-Ramírez and Teresa Cristina Lampoglia: Scaling-up using condominial technology, waterlines, Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, p. 11-13]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed estimate gives the costs of simplified sewerage in Lima as at least US$700 per household (US$120–140 per person), including in-house sanitary facilities (US$100 per household) and including design, supervision and social intermediation costs (US$126 per household, which are common costs shared with water infrastructure), but excluding taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Lampoglia of the World Bank-funded PAC project in Lima; communication by Martin Gauss, WSP&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, at higher population densities sewer systems are cheaper than on-site sanitation (such as [[septic tank]]s). The switching value at which sewerage becomes less costly is largely determined by the type of sewerage, conventional or simplified. A 1983 study in  [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] showed that the investment costs for simplified sewerage were lower than for on-site systems at the quite low population density of about 160 people per [[hectare]]. Conventional sewerage, however, was cheaper only at densities above 400 people per hectare.&lt;ref name="Mara"/&gt;

== Operation and maintenance ==
Good operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) is essential for the long-term sustainability of any sewerage system, but particularly for simplified sewerage, since the low diameter of pipes and low gradients make the system more vulnerable to clogging.

The original concept of householders being responsible for O&amp;M of in-block condominial sewers has not worked well in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/11.479/www/Roszler.doc Roszler, MIT: Reasons for the failure of community participation in the maintenance of Brazilian condominial sewers]&lt;/ref&gt; A study of simplified sewerage systems in Brazil has shown that effective maintenance of sewers by utilities has often been the result of community pressure by neighborhood associations. Without such pressure maintenance by utilities has often been inadequate, and community maintenance has not come about either.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Watson: Good Sewers Cheap? Agency-Customer Interactions in Low-Cost Urban Sanitation in Brazil, The World Bank, 1995, p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, alternative management systems had to be developed and a few examples are provided below:

* In rural [[Ceará]] a villager is employed by the Residents’ Association to maintain the sewers and the [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plant]] (typically, a single facultative waste stabilization pond). He is also responsible for the water supply.
* In parts of [[Recife]] in northeast Brazil the state water and sewerage company employs local contracting firms for O&amp;M. Usually this is done by a small team comprising a technician engineer and two laborers who work in a low-income area served by simplified sewerage and to whom residents report any problems.
* In [[Brasília]] the water and sewerage company, which has over 1,200&amp;nbsp;km of condominial sewers, uses van-mounted water jet units to clear any blockages.&lt;ref name="Mara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neder and Nazareth:[http://www.efm.leeds.ac.uk/CIVE/Sewerage/articles/condominial1.pdf Condominial sewer systems for the Federal District of Brazil], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning maintenance costs, available information indicates similar costs and requirements for the simplified and the conventional system under the same conditions. Simplified systems typically require more interventions, but the cost per intervention is lower. Comparative analytical studies are not yet available, however.

== Constraints for application  ==
According to Jose Carlos Melo, who is considered to be the "father" of condominial sewers in Brazil, some important constraints for the application of simplified sewerage are:&lt;ref name="Melo"/&gt;

* Lack of information on fundamentals and techniques of the approach or lack of experience in its application,
* Resistance to change: Institutional, technical and operational changes required by the service provider for implementing the condominial approach usually provoke resistance and can hinder the application.
* Normative and legal restrictions: Existing conservative design and construction standards linked to conventional systems can be an essential constraint in the introduction and dissemination of the systems.

Over the last years, countries like Bolivia and Peru reviewed and modernized technical standards according to methods and criteria established and accepted in Brazil in the 1980s, thus overcoming the latter constraint.

'''Teaching artists''', also known as '''art teachers''' or '''artist educators''' or '''community artists''', are [[artist|professional artists]] who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, [[After-school activity|after school programs]], community agencies, [[prison]]s, jails, and [[Social services|social service]] agencies. The ''Arts In Education'' movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm History of Teaching Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227120148/http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm |date=2012-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts learning consultant [[Eric Booth]] has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about [[the arts]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124354/http://nysaae.org/docs/The_History_of_Teaching_Artistry_By_Eric_Booth.pdf Booth Article]&lt;/ref&gt; This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm Teaching Artist described] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005527/http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate]], ''Journal of a Living Experiment, a documentary history of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative and the writers-in-the-schools movement.''

'''''Tetrabiblos''''' ({{lang|grc|Τετράβιβλος}}) 'four books', also known in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] as  '''''Apotelesmatiká''''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀποτελεσματικά}}) "Effects", and in [[Latin]] as '''''Quadripartitum''''' "Four Parts", is a text on the philosophy and practice of [[astrology]], written in the 2nd century AD by the [[Alexandria]]n scholar [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] ({{circa}} AD 90–{{circa}} AD 168).

Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was an authoritative text on [[astronomy]] for more than a thousand years, and the ''Tetrabiblos'', its companion volume, was equally influential in [[astrology]], the study of the effects of astronomical cycles on earthly matters.  But whilst the ''Almagest'' as an astronomical authority was superseded by acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], the ''Tetrabiblos'' remains an important theoretical work for astrology.

Besides outlining the techniques of astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of the subject as a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]]. This allowed Ptolemaic teachings on astrology to be included in universities during the [[Renaissance]], which brought an associated impact upon medical studies and literary works.
 
The historical importance of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is seen by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries that have been published about it. It was copied, commented on, paraphrased, abridged, and translated into many languages. The latest critical Greek edition, by Wolfgang Hübner, was published by [[Teubner]] in 1998.

[[Ptolemy]] is referred to as "the most famous of Greek astrologers"&lt;ref name="tester57"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.57].&lt;/ref&gt; and "a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude".&lt;ref name="Rutkin"&gt;Rutkin, H.

Analogies between the status of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in astrology and the Bible in Christianity are frequent. See for example [[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235, "virtually the Bible of astrology"; Broughton, ''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) p.7: "Ptolemy’s Four Books on Astrology are to the European and American Student what the Bible is to the student of Christian Theology";  Tucker, ''Principles of Scientific Astrology'' (1938) p.32: "it is the ''Tetrabiblos'' which interests astrologers ... it is their astrological bible"; and Zusne, Jones, ''Anomalistic psychology: a study of magical thinking'' (1989) p.201: "the astrologer's bible, the Tetrabiblos, is still in use in the Western world".&lt;/ref&gt;  Compiled in [[Alexandria]] in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication.&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; It was translated into [[Arabic]] in the 9th century, and is described as "by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Saliba|Saliba (1997)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mOquCzBX3xcC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20Arabs&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.67].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the translation of the ''Tetrabiblos'' into Latin in the 12th century, "Ptolemaic astrology" became integrated by [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] into medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine.&lt;ref name="Tarnas"&gt;[[#Reference-Tarnas|Tarnas (1991)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YIIRXtokSsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.193–194].&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Theology|theological]] acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as [[Dante]]'s, which helped shape the [[Morality|moral]], religious and [[Cosmos|cosmological]] [[Paradigm shift#Science and paradigm shift|paradigm]] of [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]].&lt;ref name="Tarnas" /&gt;  The ''Tetrabiblos'' was largely responsible for laying down  the basic precepts of [[Renaissance]] astrology,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Webster|Webster (1979)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g588AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Tetrabiblos%2016th%20century&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.276].&lt;/ref&gt; and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and [[early modern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;

Ptolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;  but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected [[Liberal sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Reference-Ramesey|Ramesey (1654)]] bk. I 'A vindication of astrology', p.2, which presents a lengthy argument for why astrology is defined as a "Mathematical art", being neither "a distinct Art or Science by itself" but "one of the Liberal Sciences". See also [[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 12, ch.5: 'Astrology to 1650', and [[#Reference-Thomas|Thomas (1971)]] ch.3: 'Astrology: its social and intellectual role' which describes the determined efforts to preserve the intellectual standing of astrology in the mid-late 17th century, which rapidly collapsed at the end of that century.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the contents of the ''Tetrabiblos'' started to draw stigmatisation as part of "a diabolical art of divination". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: "no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the ''Tetrabiblos'' upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of [[classical philosophy]] and the [[History of science in classical antiquity|history of sciences in antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] p.108: "Perhaps the most influential of the ancient physical accounts is that offered by Ptolemy in his ''Tetrabiblos''".&lt;/ref&gt; It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by [[astrologer]]s in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Whalley translation (1701), and 'corrected edition' by Ebenezer Sibly and his brother (1786); James Wilson (1828), and other privately circulated manuscripts of the 19th century such as that produced by John Worsdale; the [[Project Hindsight]] translation by Robert Schmidt (1994).  Details of these texts and other translations are given in the section on [[Tetrabiblos#Editions and translations|Editions and translations]].&lt;/ref&gt; The early 20th-century [[Humanism|Humanist]] astrologer [[Dane Rudhyar]] reported that the astrology of his era "originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rudhyar|Rudhyar (1936)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dApyUYhq4-4C&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Rudhyar%20astrology%20of%20personality&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the ''Tetrabiblos'' as being "without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] 'Annotated Bibliography' p.275: "This is an astrological classic and probably the most widely cited in the history of the art. It is one of the most important and influential works in the field of astrology ... without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;/ref&gt;

The work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Translator's Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject,&lt;ref name="Houlding"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-1993|Houlding (1993)]] p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "outstanding mark of Ptolemy’s astrology" is described as "informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age".&lt;ref name="tester60"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.60].&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy wrote at a time when "physics" was defined by [[philosophy]], and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of [[Macrocosm and microcosm|universal unity]] and [[Musica universalis|cosmic harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59]; [[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] pp.107-109.&lt;/ref&gt; His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's  validity.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Of this, [[Lynn Thorndike]], in his ''History of Magic and Experimental Science'', writes: "Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the ''Tetrabiblos'', continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 1, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="tester60" /&gt;  His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying affects of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] ch.2, pp.10–17. See for example[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 I.4]: 'Of the Power of the Planets'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical importance and influence of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries  published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html III, pp.xvi–xvii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=67WarAlhu-YC&amp;q=Tetrabiblos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.7]. Broughton describes its value to astrologers as "One of the best books the student should read, and which is most essential" p.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and date of composition==
[[File:Ptolemy tetrabiblos 1.jpg|thumb|Opening chapter of the first printed edition of Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'', transcribed into Greek and Latin by [[Joachim Camerarius]] (Nuremberg, 1535).]]
The commonly known Greek and Latin titles  (''Tetrabiblos'' and ''Quadripartitum'' respectively), meaning 'four books', are  traditional nicknames&lt;ref name="J1"&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] 'Introduction' by Alexander Jones, p.xii: "The ''Tetrabiblos'' (again a nickname - we do not know Ptolemy's own title, but a credible guess is ''Apotelesmatika'', roughly 'Astrological Influences')".&lt;/ref&gt; for a work which in some Greek manuscripts is entitled {{lang|grc|Μαθηματικὴ τετράβιβλος σύνταξις}}, 'Mathematical treatise in four books'.&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html II, p.x–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Eggleston Robbins, editor of the [[Loeb]] English translation published in 1940, considered it likely that this was the title used by Ptolemy himself, although he acknowledged that many other Greek manuscripts use the title {{lang|grc|Τὰ πρὸς Σύρον ἀποτελεσματικά}}, 'The prognostics addressed to Syrus'.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; An ancient anonymous commentary on the work states that some considered the term ''Tetrabiblos'' to be a fictitious name.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt;

Hübner, editor of the 1998 Teubner Greek edition, uses the title ''Apotelesmatiká'' (''biblía''), '(books on) effects', which has been followed by recent scholars.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Jones%2C%20Alexander%20(ed.)%202010.%20Ptolemy%20in%20Perspective%3A%20Use%20and%20Criticism%20of%20his%20Work%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20the%20Nineteenth%20Century&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.45].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Jones, editor of the Springer publication ''Ptolemy in Perspective'' (2010) considers that Ptolemy's own title remains unknown, but agrees that the term  ''Apotelesmatika''  is "a credible guess".&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; This term is variously translated to mean 'influences',&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; 'effects'&lt;ref name="H1" /&gt; or 'prognostics';&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; reflecting the theme of work, which is concerned with gaining foreknowledge of the effects of predictable astronomical cycles.

There is no firmly established date for the compilation of the ''Tetrabiblos''  but Ptolemy discloses in his 'Introductory Address' that he wrote his astrological treatise after completing his astronomical one: the ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.1 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.3]).&lt;/ref&gt;   Evidence within the ''Almagest'' reveals that the astronomical work could not have been completed before about 145 AD,&lt;ref&gt;N. T. Hamilton and N. M. Swerdlow, 'From Ancient Omens to Statistical Mechanics', in [[#Reference-BG|Berggren and Goldstein (1987)]], argue 150 A.D. (p.3–13); [[#Reference-Grasshoff|Grasshoff (1990)]] argues that the observations in the ''Almagest'' cover the period between 127–141 A.D. (p.7).&lt;/ref&gt;  which demonstrates that Ptolemy wrote the ''Tetrabiblos'' towards the end of his life, sometime between completing the ''Almagest'' and his death, generally reported to be around 168 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pecker|Pecker (2001)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGOVnMa-LSIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Pecker%2C%20Jean%20Claude%2C%202001.%20Understanding%20the%20Heavens%3A%20Thirty%20Centuries%20of%20Astronomical%20Ideas%20from%20Ancient%20Thinking%20to%20Modern%20Cosmology.&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.311]. Most contemporary sources give c. 90 – c. 168 as the most likely time-span of Ptolemy's life. [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins]] gives 100–178 ('Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html I p.viii]). [[#Reference-Smith-1996|Mark Smith]] also veers towards the figures given by Robbins: "It is said that he lived to be seventy-eight and survived into the reign of Antonius Pius' successor, Mark Aurelius (161–180). These two claims, if true, would lead us to place Ptolemy's death not only somewhere within that span, but probably toward the end".&lt;/ref&gt;

The text begins with Ptolemy's address to "Syrus", an unidentified character to whom all Ptolemy's works are dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hmCA5zjTr_cC&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20syrus&amp;pg=PR24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  p.xxiv, footnote 4].&lt;/ref&gt;   In this Ptolemy differentiates between two types of astronomical study: the first ([[astronomy]] proper) which discovers the astronomical cycles and movements; the second ([[astrology]]) which investigates the changes these movements bring about. He states that each has its own science and  the former is desirable in its own right "even though it does not attain the result given by its combination with the second".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; This is taken to demonstrate Ptolemy's view that astronomy and astrology are complementary studies, so that whilst astrology is less self-sufficient and factual,&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; its employment makes the practice of astronomy more useful.&lt;ref name="Lx1"&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] footnote 28: "Older versions of the history of astronomy tended to make great hay of Ptolemy's separating his astronomy and astrology into two books (the ''Almagest'' and the ''Tetrabiblos''), as though that pointed to doubts Ptolemy had about astrology as a body of knowledge. But Ptolemy is clear that even if it is ''less certain'', astrology is ''more useful'' than astronomy".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the terms ''astronomia'' and ''astrologia'' were used interchangeably in ancient texts,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.127])&lt;/ref&gt; this also demonstrates the early definition of two differentiated subjects which were discussed at length by Ptolemy in two separate works.&lt;ref name="Lx1" /&gt;

Ptolemy states that having dealt with the former subject (astronomy) in its own treatise, he "shall now give an account of the second and less self-sufficient method in a properly philosophical way, so that one whose aim is the truth might never compare its perceptions with the sureness of the first".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; In this, and further introductory remarks, he reveals his view that  astrological prediction is extremely difficult and easily subject to error, but satisfactorily attainable to those who possess the necessary skill and experience, and of too much benefit to be dismissed simply because it can sometimes be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#2 p.19]): "...it would not be fitting to dismiss all prognostication of this character because it can sometimes be mistaken, for we do not discredit the art of the pilot for its many errors; but as when the claims are great, so also when they are divine, we should welcome what is possible and think it enough".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ptolemy's philosophical arguments ====
Chapters 2 and 3 are important for giving Ptolemy's philosophical defense of his subject. [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] noticed the arguments were paralleled in older sources, particularly  those of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}}135 BCE–{{circa}}AD 51 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248. Discussed by Boll in ''Studien uber Claudius Ptolemaus'' (Leipzig, 1894) pp.131ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Ptolemy's narrative was drawn  upon by later [[philosophers]] and [[astronomers]], such as [[Johannes Kepler]] who used similar examples and the same order of arguments to explain the  physical foundation of some astrological claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jensen|Jensen (2006)]] p.118. Ptolemy's arguments were used by Kepler in his 1602 text, ''De Fundamentalis Astrologiae''.&lt;/ref&gt;   Described as  "scientifically speaking, perfectly laudable" by one modern commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248&lt;/ref&gt; another has condemned these chapters  as the place where Ptolemy's "knowledge, intelligence and rhetorical skill" are most "misused".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Long|Long (1982)]] p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter one Ptolemy asserts the legitimacy of the study and identifies the two main arguments set against it: 
# the complexity of the subject makes its claim of providing reliable foreknowledge unattainable;
# reliable foreknowledge—if it can be attained—would imply such [[fatalism]] as to make the subject's purpose useless (since if the future is predictable, anything which is destined to happen will happen whether predicted or not).
Ptolemy then answers each criticism in the following two chapters.

;Argument on the extent of astrology's reliability
In chapter two Ptolemy maintains that knowledge gained by astronomical means is attainable and he attempts to define its limits according to "Aristotelian-Stoic" logic.&lt;ref name="tester64"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;  He points out how the [[Sun]] has the greatest influence upon the Earth’s seasonal and daily cycles, and that most things in nature are synchronised by the [[Moon]]:
{{quote|... as the heavenly body nearest the Earth, the Moon bestows her effluence  most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her; the rivers increase and diminish their streams with her light, the seas turn their own tides with her rising and setting, and plants and animals in whole or in some part wax and wane with her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.7]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He extends this ability to stir the weather and steer the biological patterns of earthly creatures to  the [[stars in astrology|fixed stars]] and [[Classical planet|planets]], so that everything which experiences cycles of growth, or patterns of behaviour, is in some way responsive to the celestial cycles. These bring about elemental changes (hot, windy, snowy or watery conditions, ''etc''): led by the Sun, activated by the Moon and aided by the planetary [[astrological aspect|configurations]] and the fixed stars' [[phenomena]]. The prevailing [[meteorological]] qualities are then considered to   determine the [[temperament]] – the quality of the moment of time at a specific place - which is  presumed to be impressed, as a sort of temporal imprint, upon the seed of anything which comes into germination or manifestation at that moment in time. Ptolemy admits that successful analysis of this temperament is not easily attained but is capable of being determined by someone who is able to regard the data “both scientifically and by successful conjecture”. He questions why, if a person can reliably predict the general weather patterns and their effects upon agricultural seeds and animals from the knowledge of the celestial cycles: 
{{quote|... can he not, too, with respect to an individual man, perceive the general quality of his temperament from the ambient&lt;ref&gt;The term "ambient" refers to the humoural state of the surrounding air; ''i.e.,'' the 'enveloping environment' (''Ambient'': "relating to the immediate surroundings of something" [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ambient Oxford English Dictionary]. Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his birth, … and predict occasional events, by the fact that such and such an ambient is attuned to such and such a temperament and is favourable to prosperity, while another is not so attuned and conduces to injury?&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Whilst suggesting that such arguments are enough to demonstrate the validity of astrology, Ptolemy accepts that many mistakes are made in its practice - partly because of  "evident rascals" who profess to practice it without due knowledge and pretend to foretell things which cannot be naturally known (sometimes using the term 'astrology' for practices which are not true to the genuine study of astrology)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]), ''i.e''., those who "for the sake of gain, claim credence for another art under the name of this, and deceive the vulgar". In his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' [[Jerome Cardan]] gave the example of those who give elaborate predictions based only on the day or month of birth.&lt;/ref&gt; and because legitimate practitioners must acquire a magnitude of knowledge and experience within a limited life-span. His summary is that the study is usually only able to give reliable knowledge in general terms; that astrological advice should be welcomed but not expected to be faultless; and that the astrologer should not be criticised but encouraged to integrate non-celestial information within the compilation of a judgement (such as what is known of an individual’s ethnic background, nationality and parental influences).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.19]): "We should not object to astrologers using as a basis for calculation nationality, country, and rearing, or any other existing accidental qualities". Most of book II is given to exploring the stereotypes of nations in astrological terms.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Unibibliotek Salzburg Artes liberales Astronomia.jpg|thumb|left|15th-century manuscript illustration of astronomy as one of the [[seven liberal arts]], showing Ptolemy as its patron.]]

;Argument on whether astrology is natural and useful

In chapter three Ptolemy argues that astrological prediction is both natural and beneficial. The translation of these ideas into Latin in the 12th century are described as being "of critical importance" to the adoption of a favourable attitude towards astrology within [[Christianity]] in the [[Medieval period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lindberg|Lindberg (2007)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20ending&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.247ff].&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Ptolemy first proposes that it is not "useless" to create predictions of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in [[Cicero]]'s text ''[[De Divinatione]]'', in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they  offer no means of escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Cicero|Cicero (c. 45 BC)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/2*.html II.25,54, p.433]: "why do they warn us of things which we cannot avoid? Why, even a mortal, if he has a proper sense of duty, does not warn his friends of imminent disasters which can in no way be escaped".&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject "by which we gain full view of things human and divine",&lt;ref name="T21"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.21–23]).&lt;/ref&gt; which, he argues, gives a better perception of "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt; He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; the same can be said of all philosophy, which concerns itself with "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

Ptolemy's next argument was to avoid the criticisms that arise when the practice of prediction is seen to suggest [[fatalism|fatal necessity]].  This point was crucial to later theological acceptance, since [[Medieval]] religious doctrine dictates that the individual [[soul]] must possess [[free will]], in order to be responsible for its own choices and the consequences that flow from them. Gerard of Feltre's 13th-century text ''Summa on the Stars'' demonstrates the problem that astrological determinism creates for the theological argument: "If the stars make a man a murderer or a thief, then all the more it is the first cause, God, who does this, which it is shameful to suggest".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference- kieck|Kieckhefer (2000)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Iw6ipCq-pZsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Richard%20Kieckhefer%2C%20Magic%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20(Cambridge%3A%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%2C%202000&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.128].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's comments counter the criticism by proposing that whilst the celestial cycles are entirely reliable and "eternally performed in accordance with divine, unchangeable destiny",&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  all earthly things are also subject to "a natural and mutable fate, and in drawing its first causes from above it is governed by chance and natural sequence".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  He therefore declares that nothing is irrevocably ordained, and we are not to imagine that "events attend mankind as the result of the heavenly cause as if … destined to take place by necessity without the possibility of any other cause whatever interfering".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

In this discussion Ptolemy makes a point that was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that "the lesser cause always yields to the stronger".&lt;ref name="T25"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.25–29]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees an individual as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when "future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;  He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;

It is therefore reasonable, in Ptolemy's estimation, to moderate actions with awareness of how the prevailing and future temperament prospers or injures the natal temperament, or to elect to act at a time that is astrologically suitable to the activity – just as it is deemed rational to use knowledge of the stars to ensure safety at sea; to use knowledge of the lunar cycle to ensure successful breeding and sowing, or to cool ourselves against the extremes of temperature in order that we suffer less.

Ptolemy's philosophical conclusion on the subject, which helped to secure its intellectual standing until the 18th century, is thus: "even if it be not entirely infallible, at least its possibilities have appeared worthy of the highest regard".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt; Having justified his intellectual involvement in the study, according to the philosophical principles of his day, Ptolemy then turns his attention to the practical theory of astrology, and the rationale that lies behind the arrangement of its principles.

=== Introduction of principles ===
[[File:Bartolomeu Velho 1568.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure of the heavenly bodies''' — An illustration of the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic geocentric system]] by Portuguese cosmographer and cartographer [[Bartolomeu Velho]], 1568 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris).]]
One of the unique features of the ''Tetrabiblos'', amongst the astrological texts of its period, is the extent to which the first book not only introduces the basic astrological principles, but synthesises and explains the reasoning behind their reported associations in line with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="riley255"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, for example, explains the "power of the planets" through their associations with the creative humoral qualities of warmth or moisture, or the reductive qualities of cold and dryness.&lt;ref name="tester59"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Mars is described as a destructive planet because its humoral association is excessive dryness, whilst Jupiter is defined as temperate and fertilising because its association is moderate warmth and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.4  (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.37]). See also [[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;  These associations are based on the arrangements of the planets with regard to the Sun, as perceived from the  [[Geocentric model|geocentric perspective]], by which their orbits are measured is if they are centred upon the Earth.

Uniting these Aristotelian principles with a prevalent Greek philosophy employed by [[Zeno of Citium]] and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]s, the next three chapters arrange the planets into pairs of opposites.&lt;ref name="tester59" /&gt;   They may be [[Benefic planet|benefic]] (moderately warming or moistening) or [[Malefic planet|malefic]] (excessively cooling or drying); masculine (drying) or feminine (moistening); active and [[astrology of sect|diurnal]] (suited to the qualities of the day and aligned with the nature of the Sun) or passive and [[astrology of sect|nocturnal]]  (suited to the qualities of the night and aligned with the nature of the Moon).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.5–7 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.39–43]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these humoral associations derive from configurations with the Sun, chapter eight describes how they are subtly modified according to the  phase of each planet’s [[synodic cycle]] with the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.8 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.45]). The first quarter of the synodic cycle brings an added emphasis on moisture; the next increases warmth; the next (in which the cycle is receding) withdraws the moisture and brings an added emphasis on dryness, and the final quarter (which closes the cycle) withdraws warmth and brings an added emphasis on coldness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter nine discusses the "power of the fixed stars". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their "temperatures" as being like that of the planets he has already defined. Hence [[Aldebaran]] ("called the Torch") is described as having "a temperature like that of Mars", whilst other stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are "like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.47]).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from   historical sources, being "the observations of the effects of the stars themselves as made by our predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.59]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy Muller.jpg|thumb|left|'''Ptolemy instructing [[Regiomontanus]]''' under an image of the zodiac encircling the [[celestial spheres]]. Frontispiece from Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', (Venice, 1496).]]

Chapter ten returns to the humoral theme more explicitly, clarifying that the [[zodiac]] is aligned to the [[season]]s and so expressive of the shifting emphasis through moisture, warmth, dryness and cold, (as brought about by [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]). Similarly,  the four [[Angle (astrology)|angles of the chart]] present an humoral emphasis through association with the effects of the four cardinal [[winds]] that blow from their aligned directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.59–65]). The [[Ascendant]] is the eastern angle, associated with the east wind ([[Apeliotes]]) which excels in dryness; the [[midheaven]] is the southern angle, associated with the south wind ([[Anemoi#Notus|Notus]]) which excels in heat; the [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]] is the western angle, associated with the west wind ([[Anemoi#Zephyrus|Zephyrus]]) which excels in moisture; and the [[Imum Coeli]] is the northern angle, associated with the north wind ([[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]) which excels in cold.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of book one (up to the final two chapters which concern the [[planetary phase]]s and aspectual applications), presents the rulerships, divisions, and configurations of the [[astrological signs|zodiac signs]], most of which are related to astronomical definitions, seasonal effects, physics and [[History of geometry|geometry]]. Geometrical principles are used to define the favourable or unfavourable quality of [[astrological aspect]]s, based on the angular relationship of planets and signs with [[ecliptic]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

In Ptolemy’s era the boundaries of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible [[constellation]]s whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes suggested that Ptolemy invented the tropical zodiac or broke conventional practice in his use of it; see for example Heilen, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.52], in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]],  or  Robert and Dann,''The Astrological Revolution'', (Steiner Books, 2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxpQ1ARAS3QC&amp;lpg=PT280&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PT280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.234]. However, it is clear that Ptolemy was merely following convention, as demonstrated by ''Geminos's Introduction to the phenomena'', 'On the Circle of the Signs' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch.1], where the tropical zodiac is given detailed explanation in a text dated to the 1st century BCE, and known to be based on the accounts of older authorities ([[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]], Preface, p.xvi and Introduction, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.2]); and also because Ptolemy states that he is offering the methods of his older sources: "it is reasonable to reckon the beginnings of the signs also from the equinoxes and solstices, partly because the writers make this quite clear, and particularly because from our previous demonstrations we observe that their natures, powers, and familiarities take their cause from the solstitial and equinoctial starting-places, and from no other source. For if other starting-places are assumed, we shall either be compelled no longer to use the natures of the signs for prognostications or, if we use them, to be in error" (I.22, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.109–111]).&lt;/ref&gt;  This determines the seasonally based [[tropical zodiac]] which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός ''tropikos'': ‘of the turning’,&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'': [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtroph%2F A: 'τροπ-ή , ἡ, (τρέπω)] ('turn, turning'); 1.b "each of two fixed points in the solar year, ''the solstices''". Retrieved 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  because it is set by the turn of the seasons and, being subject to [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession]], experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Although the rate of revolution is only 1° every 72 years, it adds up over long periods of time. Nearly 2,000 years have passed since Ptolemy wrote his ''Tetrabiblos'' so the displacement is now approximating to the distance of a whole zodiac sign. The full cycle completes over the course of 26,000 years  - see [[#Reference-Evans|Evans (1998)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OX4qMyHyizYC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.245ff].&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the signs that mark the Sun’s summer and winter [[solstice]] points ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]) are described as the 'tropical signs',&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy described only Cancer and Capricorn as 'tropical' and referred to Aries and Libra (the signs of spring and autumn) as the equinoctial signs. Generally, other ancient authors referred to all four as tropical, to distinguish them from the 'solid' signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius) which indicate established seasons, and the 'bi-corporeal' signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces), which Ptolemy says are so called because "they share, as it were, at end and beginning, the natural properties of the two states of weather" (I.11, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.69]).&lt;/ref&gt; since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in [[celestial latitude]], (thereby defining the terrestrial [[circles of latitude]] known as the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.67]): "They have received their name from what takes place in them. For the Sun turns when he is at the beginning of these signs and reverses his latitudinal progress, causing summer in Cancer and winter in Capricorn".&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas other ancient astrological writers gave their emphasis to the astrological interpretation of such definitions (for example, in describing how tropical signs are indicative of quickly changing situations),&lt;ref&gt;By comparison, [[Vettius Valens]] mentions the fact that Cancer is a tropical sign as one of 14 descriptive terms for the sign, and sets out the character traits of those "so born", which includes reference to Cancerians being "changeable" (''Anthology'', I.2).&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's focus is notably different; given to the astronomical and philosophical factors that underlie the definitions rather than their astrological meaning in practice. Ptolemy explains that the definitions of the zodiac are not his own, but present "the natural characters of the zodiacal signs, as they have been handed down by tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.65]).&lt;/ref&gt;  His approach finds elegant expression where he is demonstrating the logic of schematic arrangements (such as the philosophical principles behind the [[Domicile (astrology)|planetary rulership of signs]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.17 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.79]).&lt;/ref&gt;  but is noted to convey detachment in regard to the elements of astrology that are not so obviously plausible.&lt;ref&gt;For which reason he notes, but dismisses as illogical, the use of dodecatemoria (the 12-fold division of each zodiac-sign into segments of {{frac|2|1|2}}°). His argument is that such manufactured numerical divisions have no basis in the natural astronomical cycles.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the way that Ptolemy avoids going into detail on the facets of astrology that rely on [[mythological]], or [[symbol]]ic associations, and how he is willing to outline the reasoning behind  conflicting astrological proposals without revealing any personal preference for one scheme over another.&lt;ref&gt;For example, where he explains the three different ways by which the signs can be classified as masculine or feminine (I.12, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.69–73]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to suppose he was more interested in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.247: "Quite different approaches were used by the other astrological writers, who are concerned with practical matters. Dorotheus begins, not with a proof of the validity of astrology or a description of the universe, but with instructions for calculating births, the native's status, the native's parents status, his brothers, and so on".&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do);&lt;ref&gt;The 4th-century astrologer [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]] describes in his ''Mathesis'' (7.I.I) how oaths of silence were required by [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. Vettius Valens declared that his teachings should not be imparted to the ignorant or through chance encounters (''Anthology'' 293.26–29) and relates how [[Critodemus]] extracted "frightful oaths" from his students (150.16).&lt;/ref&gt; and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.250: "Ptolemy, for whatever reason, shows few signs of the animosity toward fellow professionals which is so evident in ancient literary society".&lt;/ref&gt;  all helped to secure the text’s historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. [[Classics]] scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, [[Geography (Ptolemy)|geography]] and the other sciences on which he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: "The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science".&lt;ref name="riley255" /&gt;

== Book II: Mundane astrology ==
Book II presents Ptolemy's treatise on [[mundane astrology]]. This offers a comprehensive review of  [[ethnic stereotypes]], [[eclipses]], significations of [[comets]] and seasonal [[Lunar phase|lunations]], as used in the prediction of national economics, wars, epidemics, natural disasters and weather patterns. No other surviving ancient text offers a comparable account of this topic, in terms of the breadth and depth of detail offered by Ptolemy.  Although no demonstrated examples are given, he writes with authority in this branch of his subject, which suggests it was of particular interest to him. Modern commentators have remarked that Ptolemy was "consciously taking a different approach" to contrast "with the 'old', infinitely complicated methods".&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

Ptolemy begins by stating he has briefly reviewed the important principles and will now develop the details of astrology in the appropriate order. His point is that astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II,1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.119]): "And since weaker natures always yield to the stronger, and the particular always falls under the general, it would by all means be necessary for those who purpose an inquiry about a single individual long before to have comprehended the more general considerations".&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter gives a broad generalisation of how genetic differences develop between the inhabitants of the various [[climes]] (a demarcation based on latitude).  Communities that live close to the equator, for example, are described as having black skins, small statures, and thick woolly hair, as a protective response to the burning heat of that location. By contrast, communities that have settled in high northern regions are defined by their colder environment and its greater share of moisture. Their bodily forms are  paler, taller, with finer hair, and in their characteristics they are described as "somewhat cold in nature".&lt;ref name="TII2"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.123, 127]).&lt;/ref&gt; Both types are described as lacking civilisation because of the extremes of their environment, whereas communities that live in temperate regions are medium in colouring, moderate in stature and enjoy a more equable lifestyle. The several regions are similarly defined according to the mix that arises within this kind of analysis. Ptolemy explains that such considerations are only dealt with summarily, as a background consideration for what follows. He also makes clear that such traits are to be found "generally present, but not in every individual".&lt;ref name="TII2" /&gt;

[[File:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century map depicting Ptolemy's description of the inhabited world, (1482, Johannes Schnitzer).]]

In chapter 3 Ptolemy unites his interests in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of "our inhabited world". Maps based on Ptolemy’s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographica]]'' show Ptolemy’s definition of the inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;A footnote in the Robbins edition offers [[Jerome Cardan]]’s explanation that Ptolemy’s "inhabited world" was conceived "as a trapezium, narrower at the top (north) than the bottom, and bounded by arcs; this is divided into quadrants by north-south and east-west lines. The 'parts closer to the centre' are then marked off by lines joining the ends of the two latter, dividing each quadrant and producing 4 right-angled triangles at the centre". [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#note8 p.129, n. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four [[triplicity]] arrangements of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;The triplicity groups connect the signs that stand 120° apart, and so create the shape of a triangle when joined by lines from degree to degree within the  360° circle of the zodiac. These groups are later known as the fire, earth, air and water signs, but Ptolemy does not refer to them this way.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this triplicity governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy’s "inhabited world": the area known as Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The north-eastern quarter (Scythia) is given to the triplicity of Gemini (including Libra and Aquarius); the south-eastern (Greater [[Asia]]) to the triplicity of Taurus (inc. Virgo and Capricorn); and the south-western ([[Ancient Libya]], which corresponds to [[Northwest Africa]]),  to the triplicity of Cancer (including Scorpio and Pisces).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, these divisions are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that lie to the north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards the centre of the inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions.&lt;ref name="T131"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.131–137]).&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the "inhabited region" experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as "independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also "without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love".&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;  Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which "for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced "their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness").&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;

Though Ptolemy describes his analysis as a "brief exposition",&lt;ref name="T157"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.157–161]).&lt;/ref&gt;  the chapter builds into an extensive association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three additional assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:
# Each of the fixed stars has familiarity with the countries attributed to the sign of its ecliptic rising.
# The time of the first founding of a city (or nation) can be used in a similar way to an individual [[horoscope]], to astrologically establish the characteristics and experiences of that city. The most significant considerations are the regions of the zodiac which mark the place of the Sun and Moon, and the [[Angle (astrology)|four angles of the chart]] – in particular the [[ascendant]].
# If the time of the foundation of the city or nation is not known, a similar use can be made of the horoscope of whoever holds office or is king at the time, with particular attention given to the [[midheaven]] of that chart.&lt;ref name="T157" /&gt;

=== Use of eclipses ===

The remainder of the book shows how this information is used in the prediction of mundane events. Focus is given to eclipses, as the "first and most potent" cause of change,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.161]).&lt;/ref&gt;   supplemented by examination of the 'stations'  of the [[superior planets]]: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]). The planetary stations are where each planet's motion, according to geocentric observation, appears to halt and change direction. This leads the planet into or out of a period of [[apparent retrograde motion]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although eclipses are deemed relevant to any nation affiliated with the zodiac signs in which they occur, Ptolemy's scrutiny is reserved for regions where they are visible, which he argues will manifest the effects most noticeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]).  See also II.7 (Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7  p.177]), where the extent of obscuration helps to determine the proportion of those in the region who will feel its effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  The period of obscuration determines the endurance of the effect, with each hour proportioning to years for a solar eclipse and months for a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.167]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the eclipse with relation to the horizon is then used to judge whether the effects are most prevalent at the beginning, middle or end of the period,  with times of  intensification identified by planetary contacts to the degree of the eclipse which occur within this period.&lt;ref&gt;Effects are assumed to be most effective at the beginning of the period if the eclipse is visible near to the [[ascendant]]; in the middle of the period if it is near to the [[midheaven]], and at the end of the period if it is near to the  [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]. Attention is given to significant planetary conjunctions which fall upon, or make aspects to, the zodiac position in which the eclipse occurred. In this, planets that are rising into view in new synodic cycles signify the intensification of effects, whereas planets which are at the end of their synodic phases and disappearing under the glare of the Sun’s light bring abatements (II. 6 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.169]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Ptolemy employing a quadrant, from Giordano Ziletti's ''Principles of astrology and geography according to Ptolemy'', 1564.]]
Chapter 7 begins the examination of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by the [[Angle (astrology)|angle of the horizon]] which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny&lt;ref&gt;The four ‘angles’ of the chart show where the ecliptic cuts the eastern horizon ([[ascendant]]), the upper meridian ([[midheaven]]), the western horizon ([[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]) and the lower meridian ([[Immum Coeli]]). For an eclipse to be visible and therefore astrologically relevant, it must occur above the horizon, either preceding or succeeding the midheaven. If it falls between the ascendant and the midheaven, then the relevant preceding angle is the ascendant. If it falls between the midheaven and the descendant, then the relevant preceding angle is the midheaven.&lt;/ref&gt;   and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections.&lt;ref&gt;A procedure is outlined to establish the most significant planet. Preference is given to the planet which holds dominance over the eclipse degree but if the planet that governs the preceding angle is also powerful, preference is given to whichever is closest to one of the angles of the chart. If it is impossible to distinguish between them, both are used as partners in the signification of effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.177–179]). Particular attention is given to the star that rises on the ascendant or culminates on the midheaven, whichever of these is the relevant preceding angle. (II.7 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 p.171]).&lt;/ref&gt; and constellations involved.&lt;ref&gt;As an example of how this might be applied, an eclipse dominated by the 'beneficial planet' Jupiter, in good condition, would suggest prosperity and good meteorological conditions, whereas a planet considered to be destructive, such as Saturn, would suggest scarcity, freezing weather and floods  (II.8 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.181–183]). If the event involves the tropical signs of the zodiac, the effects could be related to politics, whereas fixed signs indicate foundations and constructions of buildings, whilst common signs indicate men and kings.  If the animal signs are involved, the effects relate to herds or oxen, but if the sign or constellation presents the form of water or fish, the influence connects to the sea, fleets and floods. Of the 'terrestrial' signs (those depicted by humans or animals that live on land), the [[Northern and southern signs|northern signs]] anticipate problems such as earthquakes that arise from the land, whilst the [[Northern and southern signs|southern signs]] bring unexpected rains (II.7 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 pp.171–175]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting prediction is of relevance to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']]  II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.191]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within his  ''Almagest'' Ptolemy explains that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years since the beginning of the reign of king [[Nabonassar]] (747 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, [[#Reference-Almagest|''Almagest'' (2nd century)]] III.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 9 of the ''Tetrabiblos'' he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena.  The colours of eclipses and "the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like" are considered&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]): "For if they appear black or livid they signify the effects which were mentioned in connection with Saturn's nature; if white, those of Jupiter; if reddish, those of Mars; if yellow, those of Venus; and if variegated, those of Mercury. If the characteristic colour appears to cover the whole body of the luminary or the whole region surrounding it, the predicted event will affect most of the parts of the countries; but if it is in any one part, it will affect only that part against which the phenomenon is inclined".&lt;/ref&gt; along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of "'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like".  Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of "the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being explicable only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.76. In footnote 15 Riley also notes [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]]’s argument that Ptolemy borrowed the structure of some components of this book from [[Posidonius]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also defends the  subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.189]): "Consequently questions of this kind would reasonably be left to the enterprise and ingenuity of the mathematician, [i.e., astrologer] in order to make the particular distinctions".&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining chapters of book II are dedicated to meteorological matters.  Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun’s ingress into Aries can be used as a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun’s ingress into any the other equinoctial and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for  seasonal concerns, and within these "monthly investigations" bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#10 p.199]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.13 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#13 p.219]).&lt;/ref&gt;  These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for:

{{quote|In every case… one should draw his conclusions on the principle that the universal and primary underlying cause takes precedence and that the cause of particular events is secondary to it, and that the force is most ensured and strengthened when the stars which are the lords of the universal natures are configurated with the particular causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.12 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#12 p.213]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the astrologer expected to have knowledge and awareness of the mundane cycles that outline the background principles of the personal horoscope, Ptolemy closes this book with the promise that the next will supply "with due order" the procedure which allows predictions based on the horoscopes of individuals.

==Book III: Individual horoscopes (genetic influences and predispositions)==
[[File:GkHor.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine reproduction of a Greek horoscope attributed to the philosopher [[Eutocius]], 497 A.D.]]
Books III and IV explore what Ptolemy terms "the genethlialogical art": the interpretation of a horoscope set for the moment of the birth of an individual.&lt;ref name="Tp221"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 pp.221–7]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that there are several cycles of life to consider but the starting point for all investigation is the time of conception or birth.  The former "the genesis of the seed"” allows knowledge of events that precede the birth; the latter "the genesis of the man" is "more perfect in potentiality"&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  because when the child leaves the womb and comes "forth into the light under the appropriate conformation of the heavens" the temperament, disposition and physical form of the body is set.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.225]). This explanation was mirrored in subsequent discussions on why the moment of birth is more reliable, though not separate, from the moment of conception. For example, Johannes Kepler was following Ptolemy when he wrote in his ''Tertius Interveniens'' (1610): "When a human being's life is first ignited, when he now has his own life, and can no longer remain in the womb - then he receives a character and an imprint of all the celestial configurations (or the images of the rays intersecting on earth), and retains them unto his grave". See [http://cura.free.fr/docum/15kep-en.html 7.1] of ''Translated excerpts'' by Dr. Kenneth G. Negus on [http://cura.free.fr Cura], retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The two moments are described as being linked by a "very similar causative power", so that the seed of the conception takes independent form at an astrologically suitable moment, whereby the impulse to give birth occurs under a "configuration of similar type to that which governed the child's formation in detail in the first place".&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  Chapter 2 continues this theme in discussing the importance of calculating the precise degree of the ascendant at birth, the difficulty of recording local time precisely enough to establish this,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#2 p.231]).&lt;/ref&gt;  and the methods available for [[Natal chart#Rectification|rectification]] (''i.e''., ensuring the chart is correct).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy’s method involves consideration of the preceding [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] (New or Full Moon before birth). The text explains the principles of the ancient astrological technique elsewhere known as the 'Animodar method of rectification' (or 'System/Trutine of Hermes') which became a standard rectification procedure for Medieval and Renaissance astrologers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 describes how the analysis of the chart is divided into predictions of:
# essential, genetic qualities established prior to birth (such family and parental influences),
# those that become known at the birth (such as the sex of the child and birth defects), and
# those that can only be known post-natally (such as length of life, the quality of the mind, illnesses, marriage, children, and material fortunes).

Ptolemy explains the order by which each theme becomes relevant, and follows this in his arrangement of topics presented in the remaining chapters of books III and IV.

First he deals with the prenatal matters, covering the astrological significators of the parents in chapter 4, and siblings in chapter 5.  Then he deals with the matters "directly concerned with the birth",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#6  p.255]).&lt;/ref&gt;  explaining how to judge such issues as whether the child will be male or female (ch.6); whether the birth will produce twins or multiple children (ch.7); and whether it will involve physical defects or monstrous forms; if so, whether these are accompanied by mental deficiency, notability or honour (ch.8).&lt;ref&gt;For example ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#8 III.8]): "if even in this case not one of the beneficent planets bears witness to any of the places mentioned, the offspring are entirely irrational and in the true sense of the word nondescript; but if Jupiter or Venus bears witness, the type of monster will be honoured and seemly, such as is usually the case with hermaphrodites or the so called harpocratiacs [deaf mutes]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with a review of astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem "half-dead", or those that have been left exposed (including whether  there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into  an unusual level of detail&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]: "That the topic was of great importance is shown by the length of Ptolemy’s chapter and the number of illustrations he gives to help the reader understand an immensely complex procedure.  This is very unusual since Ptolemy tends to avoid details of practice, and consequently needs and uses few illustrations".&lt;/ref&gt; in a responsibility that [[Auguste Bouché-Leclercq|Bouché-Leclercq]] described as "the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]. Original source given as ''L’astrologie greque'', 404 (Paris: Leroux, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Such a prediction  involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3B*.html#10 p.285]).&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives largeness in bodily form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist "more or less agreeing in detail".&lt;ref name="tester61"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.61].&lt;/ref&gt;

The third book concludes with a discussion in chapters 13 and 14 of what is described as a "largely overlooked" facet of Ptolemaic doctrine: the "psychological" one, which concerns the quality of the soul (or ''psyche'').&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas Campion]] has discussed the roots of the notion that  celestial and psychological realms are connected, which can be traced to the 6th century BC, and in Ptolemy's case presents a mixture of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy, resting on the [[Platonism|Platonic]] view that "the soul comes from the heavens" which explains "how human character comes to be determined by the heavens".&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251 (acknowledging reference to [[Van der Waerden]], Bartel, (1974) ''Science awakening'', vol. II, 'The birth of astronomy'. Leyden and New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul, for Ptolemy,  includes the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and attributed to the condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the "sensory and irrational part"), which is sensitive and attributed to the condition of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.13 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#13 p.333]). See also Campion in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; These two chapters make analysis of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as "affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological"&lt;ref name="Tp365"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.14 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#4  pp.365–9]).&lt;/ref&gt;  including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality).&lt;ref name="Tp365" /&gt; Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt;{{Rp|254}}

Within this book Ptolemy has surveyed all the topics that relate to inner qualities, genetic patterns, predispositions and the natural tendencies present from birth.  His exploration of individual horoscopes continues into book IV, the only distinction of content being that subsequent topics relate to material matters and life experiences: what Ptolemy refers to as "external accidentals".&lt;ref name="IVi"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1 p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book IV: Individual horoscopes (external accidentals)==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|left|thumb|Ptolemy's geocentric celestial spheres; Peter Apian's ''Cosmographia'' (1539)]] 
Book IV is presented with a brief introduction to reaffirm  the arrangement of content as previously described. It starts with the topics of riches and honour. Ptolemy says: "as material fortune is associated with the properties of the body, so honour belongs to those of the soul".&lt;ref name="IVi" /&gt;  Chapter 2, on material wealth, employs the "so-called '[[Part of fortune|Lot of Fortune]]'" although Ptolemy's instruction conflicts with that of many of his contemporaries in stating that for its calculation "we measure from the horoscope the distance from the sun to the moon, in both diurnal and nocturnal nativities".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1  p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's reputation ensured this approach to calculation was adopted by many later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lilly|Lilly (1647)]] p.143, (for example) repeats the instruction according to Ptolemy in his chapter 23: 'Of the Part of Fortune and how to take it, either by day or night'.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is now realised that most Hellenistic astrologers reversed the formula of calculation for [[Astrology of sect|nocturnal births]]. It is notable that in his discussion "Of the fortune of Dignity", in chapter three, Ptolemy makes no reference to the [[Part of fortune|Lot of Spirit]] (or ''Daimon''), which would normally be used as the spiritual counterpart to the material wealth and happiness associated with the Lot of Fortune. This is viewed as a demonstration of his general dislike (declared in bk. III.3)  for "lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given".&lt;ref&gt;Greenbaum, Dorian G., 'Calculating the Lots of Fortune and Daemon in Hellenistic astrology', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] pp.171–173, 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent chapter, the title of which is translated by Robbins as 'Of the Quality of Action', concerns professional inclinations and the significators of career advance (or decline). This is followed by the treatment of marriage in chapter 5, which is primarily referred to the Moon in a man's chart, to describe his wife, and the Sun in a woman's chart to describe her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.5 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4B*.html#5 pp.393–5]).&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ptolemy shows employment of the astrological technique known as [[synastry]], in which the planetary positions of two separate horoscopes are compared with each other for indications of relationship harmony or enmity.

The next four chapters complete the survey of natal themes, dealing with the topics of children (ch.6); friends and enemies (ch.7); the dangers of foreign travel (ch.8) and the quality (or type) of death (ch.9 – as opposed to the time of death considered in III.10).

The final chapter of the work is described as "a curious one"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84].&lt;/ref&gt; for introducing a separate theme at the end of the book. This refers to the seven 'ages of man', which Ptolemy briefly mentioned in III.1 as a matter which varies the emphasis of astrological configurations according to the time in life they occur: "we predict events that will come about at specific times and vary in degree, following the so called ages of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.3 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.223]).&lt;/ref&gt;
His argument is that, just as an astrologer must consider cultural differences "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should",&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.439–441]).&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will "harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes" and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or "to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men".&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This leads into a discussion of the planetary themes of the seven ages of life which:

{{quote|...for likeness and comparison depends upon the order of the seven planets; it begins with the first age of man and with the first sphere from us, that is, the moon's, and ends with the last of the ages and the outermost of the planetary spheres, which is called that of Saturn.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;}}

The information in the passage can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.443–447]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, lunations and transits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.451–455]). For more on these techniques see [[Astrological progression]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator of the [[Loeb]] 1940 English translation, F. E. Robbins, reports a "puzzling problem" regarding the final paragraph of the book. One group of manuscripts have either been left unconcluded or supplied with text that matches an ''Anonymous Paraphrase'' of the work (speculatively attributed to Proclus); the other presents text which is the same in general content, but longer, according with manuscripts that were transmitted through Arabic translations.&lt;ref name="ending"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction',  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxi].&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins considers it certain that the ending which concurs with the text of the ''Paraphrase'' is spurious. Robert Schmidt, the English translator of the later [[Project Hindsight]] edition agrees with his choice, stating that the text of the latter "sounds more generally Ptolemaic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1998)]] book IV, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins explains that the lack of an ending usually occurs when ancient books are compiled in the form of a [[codex]] rather than a roll. Since the ''Paraphrase'' edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' aimed to present the work's meaning without Ptolemy’s own complicated style of text construction, Robbins says that he "cannot conceive how anyone (except perhaps Ptolemy) could have reversed the process and evolved the tortuous, crabbed Greek of the latter from the comparatively simple language of the former".&lt;ref name="ending" /&gt; He therefore offers both versions of the ending whilst lending his support to that which is found in the Arabic version of the text. This has the book conclude with Ptolemy declaring  "since the topic of nativities has been summarily reviewed, it would be well to bring this procedure also to a fitting close".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 p.459]). See also [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html  p.xxi] for discussion of the variants. The comment quoted is from  the ending according to Parisinus 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and translations ==
No original manuscripts of the text have survived; its contents are known from translations, fragments, paraphrased copies, commentaries and later Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Astrological researcher Deborah Houlding, in an analysis of how specific points agree or vary between different editions, suggests that areas of conflicting details have been affected by three main streams of transmission: manuscripts that have passed through Arabic translation; those based on a paraphrased edition, and manuscripts that are dated four centuries later than the Arabic ones, but which have not undergone translation out of Greek.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;Houlding, Deborah 'Ptolemy's terms and conditions: the transmission of Ptolemy's terms; an historical overview, comparison and interpretation', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]]; reproduced online at [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/pdf/Houlding_ptolemy_terms.pdf Skyscript] (see p.3–4,6,11,15); retrieved 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic translations===
The oldest extant manuscript is an Arabic translation compiled in the 9th century by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. This was first translated into Latin, in Barcelona, by [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato de Tivoli]] in 1138 and became influential as the first complete introduction of Ptolemy's astrological work in Medieval Europe. It  survives in at least nine manuscripts and five Renaissance printings.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.277; and Charles Burnett's 'notice' in the preface to the reproduction of Plato de Tivoli's translation by Johannes Hervagius in 1533 (available in digital format by the [http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/pdf/fah750pto.pdf Warburg Institute] (retrieved 19 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Latin translations made from Arabic sources include an anonymous (unpublished) work compiled in 1206 and another of the 13th century by Egidio Tebaldi (Aegidius de Thebaldis).&lt;ref&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the Latin translations made from Arabic texts were circulated with a commentary compiled by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;[[#Reference-Westman|Westman (2011)]] p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Egidio Tebaldi's translation was first published by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in 1484 together with Haly's commentary and a "pseudo-Ptolemaic" list of aphorisms known as the ''[[Centiloquium]]''. This has been described as "the creature of late-fifteenth-century Italian presses".&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;

===Paraphrase based editions===
An anonymous Greek paraphrase is speculatively attributed to the 5th-century philosopher [[Proclus]]. It is often referred to as the ''Proclus' Paraphrase'' although its authenticity is questioned, being described as "very doubtful" by Professor Stephan Heilen.&lt;ref name="heilen"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.62–63].&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the ''Paraphrase'' is close to that of manuscripts of the ''Tetrabiblos'', but it uses simplified text  with the aim of providing what Heilen calls "a more easily understandable version of the difficult original work".&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt;

There is no modern critical edition of this text.&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt; The oldest extant manuscript is dated to the 10th century and housed in the [[Vatican Library]] (Ms. ''Vaticanus gr.1453, S. X.'', ff.1–219).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Some of the text of the ''Paraphrase'' was published with a Latin translation and Preface by [[Philipp Melanchthon]] in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|265}}  A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar [[Leo Allatius]] "for his own private gratification" and this was published by the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] typsetters in [[Leiden]], 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmans|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ptb/ptb03.htm#fn_8 pp.xvii]. The unknown author of the 'Address' in the 1635 Elzevir edition reports that it "was translated a few years ago" and says of its author Allatius: "He ... holds some office in the Vatican Library. He undertook his present work, however, for his own private gratification, and that of certain friends; but when writings compiled with this view have once quitted their author's hands, it will often happen that they have also, at the same time, escaped his control."&lt;/ref&gt;

Allatius' Latin translation was used as the source of all English translations of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to the Robbins' edition of 1940.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|266}} These include translations made by John Whalley (1701); the Whalley "corrected edition" made by [[Ebenezer Sibly]] and his brother (1786); J.M. Ashmand (1822); James Wilson (1828); and other 19th-century privately circulated manuscripts such as that of John Worsdale.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding, in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]], p.266 n.12, for discussion of the earlier English language editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek manuscripts===
Although no copies of Ptolemy's original manuscript remain, there are other ancient works, such as [[Hephaistio]]'s ''Apotelesmatics I'',  which describe or reproduce some of its passages. These have been used to help verify disputed areas of content.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|275}}

The oldest fairly complete Greek manuscript of the text (rather than the paraphrased edition made of it) is dated to the 13th century. Two or three others are dated to the 14th century but most are dated to the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' IV, in particular  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xviii]. See also [[#Reference-Hubner|Hübner (1998)]] p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 'Introduction' to his 1940's translation, Frank Eggleston Robbins reported the existence of at least 35 manuscripts containing all or a large part of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in European libraries.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxiii].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition was made in 1535 with an accompanying Latin translation by the German classical scholar [[Joachim Camerarius]]. This was reprinted in 1553 and is "notable for offering the first Latin translation based upon a Greek rather than Arabic source".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Robbins noted the page numbers of the 1553 edition in the Greek text which faces his English translation, stating "My collations have been made against Camerarius' second edition, because thus far this has been the standard text and it was most convenient".&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;

Also in 1940, a Greek critical edition was published by [[Teubner]], in Germany, based on the unpublished work of [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] which was completed by his student Emilie Boer. Robbins expressed regret at not being able to refer to this in the preparation of his English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xiv]: "Professor Franz Boll, whose studies of Ptolemy have been cited many times already, had begun work upon a new edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to his lamented death, July 3, 1924. His pupil, Fräulein Emilie Boer, however, continued Boll’s task, and the appearance of their completed text has been awaited since 1926. I regret very much that my own work on the present text and translation could not have profited from the results of the textual studies of these two scholars".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the 'Boll-Boer' edition became the basis of a serialised English translation by Robert Schmidt, published by [[Project Hindsight]]. The 'Translator's Preface' was critical of Robbins' understanding of some of the "conceptual issues involved" and argued the need for a new English translation which recognised the "probable superiority of the Teubner text edited by Boll and Boer in 1940".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1994)]] book I, p.vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent critical edition of the Greek text was made by the German scholar Professor Wolfgang Hübner, and published by Teubner in 1998. Based on 33 complete and 14 partial manuscripts, Hübner also incorporated the unpublished notes of Boer and the reasoning given in the Robbins and Boll-Boer editions.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} This is now considered the authoritative edition. A reviewer’s comment in The ''Classical Review'' declares of it "Progress over previous editions is evident on virtually every page".&lt;ref&gt;Tiziano Dorandi, ''The Classical Review'' (2000), New Series, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 30–32 (reported by Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.273).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In addition to the Arabic commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' made by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century,&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[[#Reference-Grafton|Grafton (1999)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GhkxjStiZfwC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=centiloquium%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.136–7].&lt;/ref&gt;
significant attention is given to an anonymous Greek ''Commentary'', which has older, obscure origins. It was written at an uncertain date, in either late antiquity or the [[Byzantine]] period. This is also attributed to Proclus, as the presumed author of the ''Paraphrase'', although Heilen has remarked that such an attribution "looks like guesswork".&lt;ref name="heilen3"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.65–66].&lt;/ref&gt;  Houlding has also pointed out that differences in tabulated information presented within the ''Paraphrase'' and the ''Commentary'' "is a telling argument that both cannot be the work of the same author".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|274}}

The Greek ''Commentary'' was first printed in 1559 with an accompanying Latin translation by [[Hieronymus Wolf]]. This claimed to be based on a heavily corrupted manuscript which required numerous conjectures by a scholarly friend of Wolf, who preferred to remain anonymous rather than face reproaches for "dabbling in this sort of literature".&lt;ref name="heilen3" /&gt; Wolf's edition was bound with an ''Introduction to the Tetrabiblos'', attributed (speculatively) to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and the [[scholia]] of Demophilus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', III [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xvi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the ''Commentary'' was to offer demonstrated illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are [[Jerome Cardan]]'s ''Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis'' (Basel, 1578) and [[Francisco Junctinus]]'s ''Speculum Astrologiae'' (Lugduni, 1583).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf ''Commentary'' in their explanatory annotations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note110 p.98, n.2] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note116 p.106, n.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centiloquium===
{{Main|Centiloquium}}
The  ''[[Centiloquium]]'' 'one hundred (sayings)' was the common Latin title of a  collection of 100 important astrological [[aphorism]]s. It was also known in Latin as ''Liber Fructus'' (Arabic: ''Kitab al-Tamara''; Hebrew: ''Sefer ha-Peri'') 'Book of the Fruit'.&lt;ref name="Sela"&gt;[[#Reference-Sela-2003|Sela (2003)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HvCns2cU6f0C&amp;pg=PA321 pp.321–2].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented "The Fruit of his Four Books".&lt;ref name="Hould-2006"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction'].&lt;/ref&gt; It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to "Syrus", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

Early manuscripts were commonly accompanied by a commentary on their use authored by [[Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri]] (835–912).&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; This became translated into Latin at the same time as translations were being made of the Arabic editions of the ''Tetrabiblos''. The earliest translations were made by [[John of Seville|Johannes Hispanensis]] in 1136 and [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato of Tivoli]] in 1138.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

[[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly), who had produced the Arabic commentary on Ptolemy's work, noticed that the aphorisms highlighted principles of [[horary astrology|interrogational]] astrology, and wondered why Ptolemy had not included coverage of these themes in his ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Jerome Cardan was the first to declare the work a forgery based on such differences, referring in his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' to an argument of [[Galen]]: "In the old days, kings who were trying to establish great libraries bought the books of famous men at very high prices. By doing so they caused men to ascribe their own works to the ancients".&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

The authorship of the text is now ascribed to "Pseudo-Ptolemy". Some scholars suggest that Ahmad ibn Yusuf was its true author.&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; Others believe that the ''Centiloquium'', though not Ptolemy's, may preserve some collation of authentic materials from [[Hellenistic astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction']; [[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] pp.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA154 154–5].&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the historical assumption that the ''Centiloquium'' was part of Ptolemy's astrological legacy gave it widespread influence in the medieval period, by which it became established as an important text within the astrological tradition.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

'''''Tigriopus brevicornis''''' (often called a Tigger-pod) is a [[coast]]al [[Marine biology|marine]] [[copepod]].&lt;ref name="marinespecies1"/&gt; They are a dominant member of shallow supra tidal [[Tide pool|rock]] pools along the North Western European coastline. A broad range of studies have been carried out on this species, including: its [[ecology]], [[physiology]], [[phylogeography]], [[metapopulation]] [[genetics]], [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[reproductive behaviour]]. ''T. brevicornis'' has also recently been used in [[ecotoxicology]] studies and has been trialled as a live feed for [[larvae]] in several [[aquaculture]]-based studies for the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Theilacker, G. H., &amp; Kimball,  a. S. (1984). Comparative quality of rotifers and copepods as foods for larval fishes. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations Reports, 25(August 1983), 80–86. https://swfsc.noaa.gov/publications/CR/1984/8491.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and Ecology ==
This species of harpacticoid [[copepod]] is found in high shore splash pools on coastlines ranging from [[Portugal]] in the south to [[Iceland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] in the north. Sometimes it can be found below the high tide mark however, like in [[Geography of Sweden|Sweden]], where it was found at depths of 10 metres in the [[Littoral zone|subtidal]].&lt;ref name="handschumacher1"&gt;Handschumacher, L., Steinarsdóttir, M. B., Edmands, S., &amp; Ingólfsson, A. (2010). Phylogeography of the rock-pool copepod Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in the northern North Atlantic, and its relationship to other species of the genus. Marine Biology, 157(6), 1357–1366. http://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1415-7&lt;/ref&gt; These splash pools occur several metres above the high tide mark, isolated from the main coastal water as a microenvironment that can vary dramatically in chemical factors such as [[salinity]], [[temperature]] and [[oxygen]] levels over relatively short temporal scales. ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' has the ability to survive these variable [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] conditions (factors that limit predators such as fish to lower pools in the [[intertidal zone]]) and as a result is known as a [[euryhaline]] [[osmoconformer]]. Temperatures in supratidal splash pools tend to track air temperatures more closely than ocean temperatures as they are often extremely shallow (only a few cm deep to a few meters deep). Salinity also changes as the pools [[evaporate]] or fill up (from 0-150 PSU) as the pools receive freshwater inputs from rain (especially so in the [[West of Ireland]]) and saltwater from wave action during [[spring tide]]s or storm surges.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;McAllen, R. J., Taylor, A. C., &amp; Davenport, J. (1998). Osmotic and body density response in the Harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis in supralittoral rock pools. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 78(04), 1143–1153. Retrieved from http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0025315400044386&lt;/ref&gt; The orange pigment [[Astaxanthin]] is synthesised by the organism as an aid against UVAR and UVBR radiation from the sun, as rock pools can be quite exposed to [[desiccation]]. The copepod's diet of [[phytoplankton]] who are rich in Highly [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|Unsaturated]] Fatty Acids (HUFAs) allow them to synthesise this protective [[protein]], granting them [[Desiccation tolerance|tolerance]] to radiation year-round.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, J., Healy, A., Casey, N., &amp; Heffron, J. J. a. (2004). Diet-dependent UVAR and UVBR resistance in the high shore harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 276(1), 299–303. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps276299&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the pools, these relatively small (~1&amp;nbsp;mm long adult) organisms can thrive as [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] [[Benthos|benthic]] foragers, feeding primarily on [[biofilm]]s of phytoplankton and other [[Microorganism|microbes]] on the rock pool bed. They also feed on [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] phytoplankton present in the water and on [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] biofilms covering the dominant rock pool alga; [[Ulva intestinalis|Enteromorpha intestinalis]]. Aside from a feeding platform, ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' take advantage of the algae's hollow nature and are known to dwell within the actual [[Ulva intestinalis|thallus]] of the green macroalga. Especially during times of [[desiccation]], the thallus provides a moist [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] for the copepod when [[Tide pool|rock]] pools completely dry out. Several hundred individuals can be found in a single strand of the hollow [[Ulva intestinalis|seaweed]], where they can survive weeks longer compared to natural [[desiccation]]. Even when [[Ulva intestinalis|Enteromorpha]] spp. aren't present in splash pools and conditions are getting too dry, the copepod can [[burrow]] down where the loose sandstone still holds moisture. These behavioural [[adaptation]]s may be a key explanation in how this species can live and thrive in such an environment as extreme and as variable as the [[Intertidal zone|supratidal]].&lt;ref&gt;McAllen, R. (1999). Enteromorpha intestinalis-a refuge for the supralittoral rockpool harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 79(6), 1125–1126. http://doi.org/10.1017/S0025315499001393&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the [[Harpacticoida|Harpacticoid]] copepods of the [[genus]] Tigriopus Norman 1868, ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' belong to the subclass [[Copepod]]a which is of high [[Food web|ecological]] importance. Copepoda is the second largest [[Crustacean]] taxa and approximately 12,000 species of copepods have been described. They are one of the dominant [[Taxon|taxa]] in aquatic [[zooplankton]] communities representing 70% of the ocean’s [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and thus the principal link between the [[phytoplankton]] and higher [[Trophic level|trophic]] levels. Harpacticoids also play an important role in the marine meiobenthic [[Food web|food]] web, especially as food for [[Juvenile fish|juvenile]] fish.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Raisuddin, S., Kwok, K. W. H., Leung, K. M. Y., Schlenk, D., &amp; Lee, J. S. (2007). The copepod Tigriopus: A promising marine model organism for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Aquatic Toxicology, 83(3), 161–173. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.04.005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogeography, Metapopulation and Genetics studies==
Supratidal splash pools are often so high on the [[shore]]line that they can become isolated from the coastal water and neighbouring pools for long periods of time. From this, scientists have speculated whether these neighbouring pools actually have different [[population]]s of copepods, and found that some pools only metres apart may never share [[genes]] through [[Gene flow|cross breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Wormhoudt, A. (2015). Seasonal and Cyclical Changes in Genetic Composition of the Marine Intertidal Rock Pool Copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Biochemical Genetics, 53(4-6), 79–92. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10528-015-9674-0&lt;/ref&gt; The upper shore rock pool mosaic with interspersed copepod [[Community (ecology)|communities]] therefore forms a [[metapopulation]]. This is a rare occurrence in a [[marine biology|marine]] system, where [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] ability is usually less impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. P. (2001). Metapopulation dynamics of Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in intertidal rock pools. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 211, 215–224. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps211215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altermatt, F., Bieger, A., &amp; Morgan, S. (2012). Habitat characteristics and metapopulation dynamics of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 468, 85–93. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps09994&lt;/ref&gt; This extremely restricted dispersal has perplexed researchers, as phylogeographical studies have shown that despite this, distant relatives of ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' were capable of occasional long distance transport, [[colonising]] large [[geographic]] areas within the last 12 to 15 thousand years. A 1&amp;nbsp;mm long copepod somehow managed to traverse the Atlantic Ocean in the past - over 4000 kilometres.&lt;ref name="handschumacher1"/&gt;

== Reproduction and Development ==
''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' undergoes several stages of [[Developmental biology|development]], with 12 distinctive post-embryonic developmental stages; 6 [[Crustacean larvae|naupliar]] (copepod baby) stages, 5 copepodid (teenage) stages and an adult stage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Animals are sexually [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] and males are usually slightly smaller than females, possessing enlarged [[Antenna (biology)|antennules]]. These antennules are used to perform a characteristic [[Mate guarding|mate]]-guarding behaviour to secure a potential mate, where they grasp females before the actual [[mating]] event. Mating pairs will stay attached for several hours, and [[sperm]] is stored in a special organ known as a [[spermatheca]]. Females are highly [[Fertility|fecund]] and usually bear multiple [[Offspring|broods]] of [[Egg cell|eggs]] developed sequentially after a single mating with brood sizes of 30–50 [[Crustacean larvae|nauplii]]. [[Fertilisation|Fertilised]] ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' females are easily identifiable by the presence of a large dark egg sac attached to their hind [[Segmentation (biology)|segment]]. Other ''Tigriopus spp.'' females have varying numbers of egg sacs attached posteriorly (see image below).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J.H., 1936. The occurrence, ecology and life history of Tigriopus fulvus (Fischer). J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U.K. 20, 523–536.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Different T. brevicornis developmental stages.

[[File:Tigriopus brevicornis female.png|thumb|T. brevicornis female with characteristic single posterior egg sac.]]

== Behaviour ==
Studies on different behavioural traits of this species has been useful for understanding how it survives in its [[Tide pool|extreme]] environment.

=== Swimming and Feeding===
Although classed as a [[Benthos|benthic]] copepod, this particular species of ''Tigriopus'' is surprisingly [[Motility|motile]], and has been noted to spend prolonged amounts of time in the water column of experimental mesocosms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;De Troch, M., Chepurnov, V. a., Vincx, M., &amp; Ólafsson, E. (2008). The effect of Fucus vesiculosus on the grazing of harpacticoid copepods on diatom biofilms. Journal of Sea Research, 60(3), 139–143. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2008.05.005&lt;/ref&gt; While copepodites (adults) have six pairs of [[Carapace|cephalic]] [[appendage]]s used for swimming and food collection and up to five pairs of specialized ‘‘swimming legs’’ allocated for jumping, nauplii have only three pairs of appendages to be used for motion and feeding. Therefore, the kinematics of nauplii is different from that of adults. They have a swimming-by-jumping propulsion mode, with alternating power and recovery strokes of three pairs of cephalic appendages. This is fundamentally different from the way other [[Plankton|microplankton]] move, and the propulsion efficiency of the nauplii is low.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen Borg, C. M., Bruno, E., &amp; Kiørboe, T. (2012). The Kinematics of Swimming and Relocation Jumps in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 33–35. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047486&lt;/ref&gt; Very early ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' naupliar stages tend to crawl on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] they are feeding on, and this may hinder their motility even further. An interesting trait of some nauplii is to beat their appendages while being stationary, which results in the creation of a strong feeding [[Current (fluid)|current]] that is about 10 times faster than the average translation speed of the nauplius. More efficient feeding is a result of this clever adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, E., Andersen Borg, C. M., &amp; Kiørboe, T. (2012). Prey Detection and Prey Capture in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 1–8. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047906&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannibalism ===
Adult ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' have been shown to eat the first two developmental stages of [[Crustacean larvae|nauplii]] (N1 and N2) when population [[Population density|densities]] are high or when food availability is low. Speculation concerning the females' ability to recognise their own young and therefore not eat them is no longer supported, as more recent studies have indicated that this [[Offspring|kin]] [[Kin recognition|recognition]] does not exist within the ''Tigriopus'' genus. This is further supported by the fact that ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' produce several large [[Clutch (eggs)|broods]] of eggs per year, and any form of parental [[Parental care|care]] would be highly unlikely given their huge energy investment in producing so many offspring.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Gallucci, F., &amp; Ólafsson, E. (2007). Cannibalistic behaviour of rock-pool copepods: An experimental approach for space, food and kinship. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 342(2), 325–331. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2006.11.004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Given the species' high natural abundances and their occurrence as a [[Nuisance wildlife management|nuisance]] species in some [[Brine shrimp|brine]] shrimp / [[rotifer]] [[aquaculture]] tanks, these copepods were further researched as a potential live feed for larviculture thereafter.

=== Aquaculture ===
''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' and many other copepod species have been analysed for their effectiveness as a live feed in marine larviculture ([[Ichthyoplankton|larvae]] [[aquaculture]]).

'''Utopian socialism''' is a label used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Étienne Cabet]] and [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html|title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed "utopian socialism" as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary. These visions of ideal societies competed with [[Marxist]]-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0853457980|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a [[pejorative]] in order to imply ''naiveté'' and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century is [[ethical socialism]], which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds.

However, one key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists (including most [[anarchists]]) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or political revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge. Utopians believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

== Definition ==
{{see also|Utopia}}
The thinkers identified as utopian socialist did not use the term "utopian" to refer to their ideas. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the first thinkers to refer to them as "utopian", referring to all socialist ideas that simply presented a vision and distant goal of an ethically just society as utopian. This utopian mindset which held an integrated conception of the goal, the means to produce said goal and an understanding of the way that those means would inevitably be produced through examining social and economic phenomena can be contrasted with [[scientific socialism]], which has been likened to [[Taylorism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This distinction was made clear in Engels' work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1892, part of an earlier publication, the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' from 1878). Utopian socialists were seen as wanting to expand the principles of the French revolution in order to create a more "rational" society. Despite being labeled as utopian by later socialists, their aims were not always utopian and their values often included rigid support for the scientific method and the creation of a society based upon scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 1)|author=Frederick Engels|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The term "utopian socialism" was introduced by Karl Marx in "For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything" in 1843 (and then developed in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in 1848), although shortly before its publication Marx had already attacked the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in ''[[The poverty of philosophy|Das Elend der Philosophie]]'' (originally written in French, 1847). The term was used by later socialist thinkers to describe early socialist or quasi-socialist intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of [[egalitarian]], [[communalist]], [[meritocratic]], or other notions of "perfect" societies without considering how these societies could be created or sustained.

In ''Das Elend der Philosophie'', English title ''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Marx criticized the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of Proudhon set forth in ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]''. Marx accused Proudhon of wanting to rise above the [[bourgeoisie]]. In the history of Marx's thought and [[Marxism]], this work is pivotal in the distinction between the concepts of utopian socialism and what Marx and the Marxists claimed as scientific socialism.

Although utopian socialists shared few political, social, or economic perspectives, Marx and Engels argued that they shared certain intellectual characteristics. In ''The Communist Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich and Marx, Karl Heinrich. »Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei«. Edited by Sálvio M. Soares. MetaLibri, October 31, 2008, v1.0s.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels wrote: "The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see it in the best possible plan of the best possible state of society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavor, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel".

Marx and Engels used the term "scientific socialism" to describe the type of socialism they saw themselves developing. According to Engels, socialism was not "an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes{{spaced ndash}}the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historical-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict".

Critics have argued that utopian socialists who established experimental communities were in fact trying to apply the [[scientific method]] to human social organization and were therefore not utopian. For instance, [[Joshua Muravchik]] on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s definition of science as "the practice of experimentation, of hypothesis and test" argued that "Owen and Fourier and their followers were the real ‘scientific socialists.’ They hit upon the idea of socialism, and they tested it by attempting to form socialist communities". Muravchik further argued that in contrast Marx made untestable predictions about the future and that Marx's view that socialism would be created by impersonal historical forces may lead one to conclude that it is unnecessary to strive for socialism because it will happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publication/the-rise-and-fall-of-socialism/ The Rise and Fall of Socialism] Joshua Muravchik SPEECHES AEI Bradley Lecture Series Publication Date: February 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] overtook utopian socialism in terms of intellectual development and number of adherents. At one time almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claimed to be Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/marx.html|author=Steven Kreis|title=Karl Marx, 1818-1883|publisher=The History Guide|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currents like [[Saint-Simonianism]] and [[Fourierism]] attracted the interest of numerous later authors but failed to compete with the now dominant Marxist, Proudhonist, or Leninist schools on a political level. It has been noted that they exerted a significant influence on the emergence of new religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[occult]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Julian (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]."

''Aries'' 16/1, pp. 13–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and in practice ==
Perhaps the first utopian socialist was [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535), who wrote about an imaginary socialist society in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516. The contemporary definition of the English word "utopia" derives from this work and many aspects of More's description of Utopia were influenced by life in [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Davis|title=Utopia and the Ideal Society: A Study of English Utopian Writing 1516-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5T-LVB-6tIC&amp;pg=PA58|date=28 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27551-4|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen.png|thumb|[[Robert Owen]] was one of the founders of utopian socialism]]
[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|Utopian socialist pamphlet of Swiss social medical doctor [[Rudolf Sutermeister]] (1802–1868)]]
[[Saint-Simonianism]] was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). His ideas influenced [[Auguste Comte]] (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and many other thinkers and social theorists.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a successful Welsh businessman who devoted much of his profits to improving the lives of his employees. His reputation grew when he set up a textile factory in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]], co-funded by his teacher, the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] and introduced shorter working hours, schools for children and renovated housing. He wrote about his ideas in his book ''A New View of Society'' which was published in 1813 and ''An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilized parts of the world'' in 1823. He also set up an [[Owenite]] commune called [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in [[Indiana]]. This collapsed when one of his business partners ran off with all the profits. Owen's main contribution to socialist thought was the view that human social behavior is not fixed or absolute and that humans have the free will to organize themselves into any kind of society they wished.

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) rejected the [[industrial revolution]] altogether and thus the problems that arose with it, Fourier made various fanciful claims about the ideal world he envisioned. Despite some clearly non-socialist inclinations,{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} he contributed significantly even if indirectly to the socialist movement. His writings about turning work into play influenced the young Karl Marx and helped him devise his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. Also a contributor to [[feminism]], Fourier invented the concept of ''[[phalanstère]]'', units of people based on a theory of passions and of their combination. Several colonies based on Fourier's ideas were founded in the United States by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

[[Étienne Cabet]] (1788–1856), influenced by Robert Owen, published a book in 1840 entitled ''Travel and adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria'' in which he described an ideal [[communalist]] society. His attempts to form real socialist communities based on his ideas through the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]] did not survive, but one such community was the precursor of [[Corning, Iowa]]. Possibly inspired by [[Christianity]], he coined the word "communism" and influenced other thinkers, including Marx and Engels.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898) published ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in 1888, a utopian romance novel about a future socialist society. In Bellamy's utopia, property was held in common and money replaced with a system of equal credit for all. Valid for a year and non-transferable between individuals, credit expenditure was to be tracked via "credit-cards" (which bear no resemblance to modern credit cards which are tools of debt-finance). Labour was compulsory from age 21 to 40 and organised via various departments of an Industrial Army to which most citizens belonged. Working hours were to be cut drastically due to technological advances (including organisational). People were expected to be motivated by a Religion of Solidarity and criminal behavior was treated as a form of mental illness or "atavism". The book ranked as second or third best seller of its time (after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Ben Hur''). In 1897, Bellamy published a sequel entitled ''Equality'' as a reply to his critics and which lacked the Industrial Army and other authoritarian aspects.

[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) published ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' in 1890, partly as a response to Bellamy's ''Looking Backwards'', which he equated with the socialism of Fabians such as Sydney Webb. Morris' vision of the future socialist society was centred around his concept of useful work as opposed to useless toil and the redemption of human labour. Morris believed that all work should be artistic, in the sense that the worker should find it both pleasurable and an outlet for creativity. Morris' conception of labour thus bears strong resemblance to Fourier's, while Bellamy's (the reduction of labour) is more akin to that of Saint-Simon or in aspects Marx.

The [[Brotherhood Church]] in Britain and the [[Life and Labor Commune]] in Russia were based on the [[Christian anarchist]] ideas of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) and [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921) wrote about anarchist forms of socialism in their books. Proudhon wrote ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) and ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1847). Kropotkin wrote ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' (1892) and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' (1912). Many of the anarchist collectives formed in [[Spain]], especially in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were based on their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Dolgoff|authorlink=Sam Dolgoff|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936–1939]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many participants in the historical [[kibbutz]] movement in [[Israel]] were motivated by utopian socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof|author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=2|issue=2|date=September 1972|pages=224–232|jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustin Souchy]] (1892–1984) spent most of his life investigating and participating in many kinds of socialist communities. Souchy wrote about his experiences in his autobiography ''Beware! Anarchist!''.

[[Behavioral psychologist]] [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) published ''[[Walden Two]]'' in 1948. The [[Twin Oaks Community]] was originally based on his ideas.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (born 1929) wrote about an impoverished anarchist society in her book ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' published in 1974 and in which the anarchists agree to leave their home planet and colonize a barely habitable moon in order to avoid a bloody revolution.

== Related concepts ==
Some communities of the modern [[intentional community]] movement, such as [[kibbutzim]], could be categorized as utopian socialist.

For example, religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] or [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1VwVSDBleUC&amp;pg=PA61|title=America's Economic Moralists: A History of Rival Ethics and Economics|author=Donald E. Frey|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2009|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classless modes of production in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are referred to as "[[primitive communism]]" by Marxists to stress their classless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/33429/Primitive+communism%3A+life+before+class+and+oppression|title=Primitive communism: life before class and oppression|publisher=Socialist Worker|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept is that of a socialist utopia, usually depicted in works of fiction as possible ways society can turn out to be in the future and often combined with notions of a technologically revolutionized economy.

'''Water quality modeling''' involves the prediction of [[water pollution]] using [[mathematical model|mathematical simulation]] techniques. A typical [[water quality]] model consists of a collection of formulations representing physical mechanisms that determine position and momentum of [[pollutants]] in a water body.  Models are available for individual components of the hydrological system such as [[surface runoff]]; there also exist basinwide models addressing [[hydrologic transport model|hydrologic transport]] and for ocean and estuarine applications.  Often [[finite difference]] methods are used to analyse these phenomena, and, almost always, large complex [[computer model]]s are required.

==Formulations and  associated Constants==
Water quality is modeled by one or more of the following formulations:
* [[Advective Transport formulation]]
* [[Dispersive Transport formulation]]
* [[Surface Heat Budget formulation]]
* [[Dissolved Oxygen Saturation formulation]]
* [[Reaeration formulation]]
* [[Carbonaceous Deoxygenation formulation]]
* [[Nitrogenous Biochemical Oxygen Demand formulation]]
* [[Sediment oxygen demand formulation]] (SOD)
* [[Photosynthesis and Respiration formulation]]
* [[pH and Alkalinity formulation]]
* [[Nutrients formulation]] (fertilizers)
* [[Algae formulation]]
* [[Zooplankton formulation]]
* [[Coliform bacteria formulation]] (e.g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'')
