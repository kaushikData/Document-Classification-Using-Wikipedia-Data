'''Ballynacregga''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: Baile na Creige)&lt;ref name="galwaylibrary.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://places.galwaylibrary.ie/place/2394|title=Place names of Galway |website=Galway Library |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a town in [[County Galway]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Ballynacregga is on the eastern shore of [[Lough Corrib]]. It is in a northern part of County Galway, near the border of [[County Mayo]].

==History==
In 1901, eight households lived in Ballynacregga.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Galway/Killursa/Ballynacregga/|title=National Archives: Census of Ireland 1901|website=www.census.nationalarchives.ie|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, that number had increased to ten households.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives.ie1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Galway/Killursa/Ballynacregga/|title=National Archives: Census of Ireland 1911|website=www.census.nationalarchives.ie|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 33 individuals in both years.

The [[Irish language]] town name, Baile na Creige, means "town of the rock" in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="galwaylibrary.ie"/&gt;

==Irish language==
Ballynacregga had a large [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking population in the early 1900s. Most people in the town spoke both Irish and English. A few older residents only spoke Irish. This chart is a breakdown of how Ballynacregga residents responded to the census category, "Write the word "IRISH" in this column opposite the name of each person who speaks IRISH ''only'', and the words "IRISH &amp; ENGLISH" opposite the names of those who can speak both languages. In other cases no entry should be made in this column." in 1901 and 1911.

'''[[Cannabis]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is illegal, but continues to be produced illicitly.

==History==
[[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] was one of the biggest producers of hemp, and before the 1950s, it had over 150.000 hectares dedicated to hemp cultivation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Cannabis wasn't widely used as a recreational drug in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], most of the grown [[hemp]] would be used for it's other natural resources such as oil and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhempassociation.org/jiha/iha02113.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan war]], [[Charas]] (Чарас) were often bought from [[Afghan]] children and then smoked by [[Soviet Army|Soviet soldiers]], it would usually get smuggled into the [[Soviet Union]] by returning soldiers.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Production==
Cannabis that is suitable for recreational use is often grown in small plantations, hidden amongst corn, in black soil suitable for cultivation which is found in the central and southern parts of the country.

Though illegal, a lot of [[Cannabis ruderalis|Cannabis Ruderalis]] is grown out in the open in small villages for mostly non-recreational use, because of the low amount of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] in [[Cannabis ruderalis|C. Ruderalis]].

==Enforcement==
According to Article 106-2 [[KUoAP]], cultivation (without intent to sell) up to 10 cannabis plants qualifies as an administrative violation, with a fine of from 18 to 100 non-taxable income units (300-1700 [[hryvnia]] in 2011) and the seizure of plants.&lt;ref name="rada.gov.ua20090319"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ющенко| first = Віктор| title = Про внесення змін до Кодексу України про адміністративні правопорушення та Кримінального кодексу України щодо посилення відповідальності за незаконний посів або незаконне вирощування снотворного маку чи конопель (№ 1165-VI)| work = Верховна Рада України| date = 2009-03-19| url = http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1165-17/print1462851647388498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit for possession without intent to sell, for which no criminal liability is given, is up to 5 grams of cannabis.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, there are plans to raise this limit to 10 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golosua.com/ua/main/article/podiyi/20100701_dopustimu-mezhu-zberigannya-marihuani-planuyut-zbi ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand''' ('''CSS:NZ''') is an international and military affairs research ([[strategic studies]]) centre located in Wellington, [[New Zealand]]. Formerly jointly supported by the New Zealand [[Ministry of Defence (New Zealand)|Ministry of Defence]], [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], and [[Victoria University of Wellington]], it is now a part of Victoria University's School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations.

==History==
Established in 1993 following a perceived need to examine New Zealand's international relations and situation more closely, the Centre has had four directors. [[Terence O'Brien (New Zealand diplomat)|Terence O'Brien]], who was a former New Zealand diplomat with a career as New Zealand Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva]], the European Commission in Brussels, and the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City|New York]], was appointed as Director when the Centre was first established. From 1993–2002 when O'Brien and then Dickens were Directors, the Centre was most active. The Centre managed to retain a reputation for independent advice not linked to the policies of major [[New Zealand]] political parties.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Centre put out a number of publications and thought pieces related to New Zealand security and defence issues.[[David Dickens]], the former Deputy Director, took over when Mr O'Brien's term finished in 2000.Dickens was in his turn succeeded by [[Peter Cozens]],Cozens retired in late 2009.  Robert Ayson, formerly with the [[Strategic and Defence Studies Centre]] of the Australian National University, took over as Director and concurrent Professor of Strategic Studies in early 2010. The Current Director is Associate Professor David Capie.

The '''Ciociara Grigia''' or '''Grigia Ciociara''' is an indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from [[Lazio]] in central Italy. It takes its name from the [[Ciociaria]], the area around [[Frosinone]]. It is thought to have originated in the area of the [[Monti Aurunci]] and the [[Monti Ausoni]].&lt;ref name=aspa3/&gt; It is raised in those mountains, in the [[Monti Lepini]], and in the [[Val Comino]]. Because of the [[transhumant]] management of the herds it has also diffused into some neighbouring areas of [[Campania]] and [[Abruzzo]].&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;

At the end of 2013 the registered population was 674.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

The '''Democratic and Republican Alliance''' ({{Lang-fr|Alliance Démocratique et Républicaine}}, ADERE) is a [[political party]] in [[Gabon]].

==History==
The party won a single seat in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 1996|1996 parliamentary elections]]. It gained two more seats in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2001|2001 elections]] and retained all three seats in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], in which it was part of the bloc led by the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/ga.html Elections in Gabon] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

At a plenary session on 15 January 2010, ADERE decided to rejoin the Presidential Majority, which it had left in mid-2009, while expressing support for the reforms instituted by President [[Ali Bongo Ondimba|Ali Bongo]] since taking office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=16584 "Gabon : Divungi fait son come-back dans la cour de Bongo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122210044/http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=16584 |date=22 January 2010 }}, Gaboneco, 16 January 2010 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The party lost all three seats in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2011|2011 elections]].

ADERE President [[Dieudonné Pambou]] died on 24 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/nouvelles_africaines_31612.html "L’Adere en deuil : Décès de Dieudonné Pambou"], Gaboneco, 27 January 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eierpunsch (3185186964).jpg|thumb]]
'''''Eierpunsch''''' (literally "[[egg (food)|egg]] [[punch (drink)|punch]]") is the [[German language|German]] name given to a warm, sweetened alcoholic, egg-based drink similar to egg nog [http://german.about.com/library/blrezept_eggpunch.htm]. It is commonly a winter drink and can be found served in the popular [[Christmas market]]s of Germany and Austria. Eierpunsch is made with egg yolks, sugar, [[white wine]] and [[vanilla]]. Sometimes [[cream]] or [[custard]] can be added.

A typical recipe of ''Eierpunsch'' with white wine to serve 3-4 persons would be:

*1 bottle of white wine (750 ml)
*4 eggs (or 8 egg yolks)
*5 tablespoons of sugar
*one packet of vanilla sugar (equivalent of 2 tsp. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla extract)
*Pinch of cinnamon
*4 cloves
*250 ml. of strong tea
*lemon or lemon juice

Prepare the 250 ml. of tea and allow to cool.  Whisk the 5 tablespoons of sugar into the eggs (or egg yolks) and add a little cold white wine and then beat vigorously.  Add the vanilla sugar to the mixture and pour in the remaining white wine, cinnamon, the cloves, lemon juice and the cooled tea.  It is also optional to add 50ml of dark rum to the mixture.  Transfer the mixture to a pan and gently heat.  Do not let the mixture heat too quickly.  Before the mixture comes to the boil remove from the heat, the mixture should be foaming on top. Remove the four cloves. Serve hot and foamy in a mug with optionally whipped cream on top and a ginger biscuit. (This recipe can also be made with red wine, however do not add 250 ml strong tea to the mixture, this will also affect the number of servings too.

The '''flag of [[Rotterdam]]''', the [[Netherlands]], was adopted 10 February 1949. It is a horizontal triband of green-white-green. This color combination is also found in the [[coat of arms of Rotterdam]]. The ratio is 2:3. 

The colors green and white are the colors of Rotterdam since the [[Middle Ages]], but the employment of the flag of Rotterdam has varied greatly. The green refers to the Court of Wena and the white symbolizes the [[Rotte (river)|Rotte]].

Although he was too young to join the army during [[Murat IV]]'s campaign, he secretly joined the army and was the first soldier to plant the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flag to the bastion of the fort. But soon he fell. His remains were buried in his home village which was Dorikini. In 1960s the name of the village was changed to Gençosman to commemorate him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sosyodenemeler.blogspot.com.tr/2013/06/genc-osman-turbesi-aksaray-aksaray.html Social essays {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Burmese language|2=Hakka Chinese}}'''Hakha Chin''', also rendered as '''(Lai)''', is a Chin language spoken by Lai people. The total figure the Hakha Chin (Lai) speakers are largely in Chin State, Burma and Mizoram in Northeast India, with a small number of speakers in southeastern Bangladesh. Now a day, more than fifty thousands Hakha Chin speakers are living in the western countries such as USA, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Germany and as well as Australia and New Zealand.

'''Hakha Chin (Lai)''' language acts as a lingua franca in most parts of Chin State and is a native language in Hakha, Thantlang, and parts of Matupi. Derived from the same Lai dialect and sharing 85% of their phonology, Falam speakers can easily communicate with Hakha speakers. As Hakha is the capital of Chin State, its provides government employment and business opportunities to people living elsewhere in Chin State. Those people live here temporarily or permanently, and their families eventually learn how to speak Lai holh/ Lai tong.

'''Differences between Burmese and Chin languages:'''

There is some confusion with regards to Burmese and Chin being one and the same language. But this is not correct, as the Chin people are one of the major ethnic nationalities in Burma. Moreover, Chin has a wide variety of languages and dialects, whereas Burmese is the official language of Myanmar. 

The Chin language has many varieties, not all mutually intelligible, and the linguistic differences are compounded by highly varied levels of education and contact with the western world.

In fact, there are 31 different varieties of the Chin language, which are also spoken in India and Bangladesh. The largest varieties are:

*[[Hakha]] Chin (Lai) with an estimated 125000 speakers
*[[Falam language|Falam]] Chin with an estimated 107,300 speakers
*[[Zomi|Zomi Chin]] with an estimated 150000 speakers

There are also many different accents among the same dialects. 

The Chin people use Latin script (Hakha alphabet) or Burmese script as their Writing System.

'''''Burmese and Chin are not one and the same language. Some Chin speak standard Burmese, but this varies greatly by age, work experience and education level.'''''

Burmese, on the other hand, is the official language of Myanmar. The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River Valley, use a number of largely similar dialects, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the peripheral areas of the country. 

==Phonology==

===Syllable structure===
Words in the Hakha Chin language are predominantly monosyllabic with some sesqui syllables featuring a "reduced syllable"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2004_4_05_8112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Full syllables are either open or closed with a rising, falling, or low tone.

=== Consonants ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
The Hakha Chin language differentiates between voiced, voiceless, and voiceless aspirated obstruents. Additionally, two sets of sonorants are realised.&lt;ref name="ic.payap.ac.th"&gt;http://ic.payap.ac.th/wp-content/uploads/linguistics_PDF/Khois-Proto-Reconstruction-of-Chin-revised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants allowed in syllable codas are {{IPA|/p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j, w/}}.

The unattested parent language, Proto-Chin, featured a voiced velar plosive {{IPA|ɡ}}. The phoneme itself was lost in all of its daughter languages, due to a spirantisation to ɣ, which a labialisation followed afterwards.&lt;ref name="ic.payap.ac.th"/&gt; Only certain loanwords, not native words, have the voiced velar plosive.

In the Hakha alphabet, {{angbr|h}} transcribes the glottal fricative in initial position, but a glottal stop in coda position.&lt;ref&gt;http://hobugt.dk/ordbog/artikler/pronunciation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Voiceless approximants are distinguished in writing from their voiced counterparts with a prefixed {{angbr|h}}.

===Vowels===
The Hakha language features five vowels which may be long or short. Allophones occur for closed syllables.&lt;ref name="ic.payap.ac.th"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Front !! Central !! Back
|-
| '''Close''' || i ||  || u
|-
| '''Mid''' || e ||  || o
|-
| '''Open''' ||  || a || 
|}
The Hakha language also features diphthongs.&lt;ref name="ic.payap.ac.th"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Front !! Central !! Back
|-
| Close || ia iu ||   || ui ua
|-
| Mid || ei eu ||  || oi

==Grammar==
Hakha-Chin is a subject-object-verb (SOV) language, and negation follows the verb.

==Literacy and literature==
Literacy rates are lower for older generations and higher in younger generations.&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cnh Chin-China], Ethnologue, 1983, 1991, 1996, 2000, access date 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Hakha-Chin language uses the [[Latin script]] and reportedly the [[Pau Cin Hau script]], unlike most languages of India and Bangladesh which use [[Devanagari]] or other Southeast Asian alphabets. Between 1978 and 1999, the Bible was translated into the language.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The Hakha-Chin language is also known as Haka, Baung-shè, and Lai in Burma, India, and Bangladesh&lt;ref name="eth" /&gt;. The [[Chin people|Hakha-Chin]] people are largely members of the [[Lai (people)|Lai]] tribe. In India, they are a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribe]], which means the government recognizes them as a distinct people. As they mostly live in hilly or even mountainous remote areas, most Hakha-Chin speakers rely on [[shifting cultivation|swidden agriculture]]&lt;ref name="eth" /&gt;. Hakha-Chin speakers are predominantly [[Christianity in Myanmar|Christian]].&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

===Burma===
As of 1991, there were 100,000 Hakha-Chin speakers in Burma.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; Dialects vary from village to village.

===Bangladesh===
As of 2000, there were 1,264 Hakha-Chin speakers in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; In Bangladesh, the Senthang dialect Shonshe is spoken and it may be a language in its own right.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

===India===
As of 1996, there were 345,000 Hakha-Chin speakers in India, mostly in the [[Lawngtlai District|Lawngtlai]], [[Chhimtuipui District|Chhimtuipui]], and [[Aizawl district|Aizawl]] districts of Mizoram as well as the southernmost tip of [[Assam]]&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;. In India, the language is also known as Lai Pawi and Lai Hawlh and is taught in some primary schools. Most of its younger speakers in India are [[Literacy in India|literate]]&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;.

'''Heli Air Services''' is a [[charter airline]] based in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. The airline was founded in 1990. The airline mainly transports passengers, cargo and mail. In the beginning, Heli Air only operated helicopters and subsequently incorporated the [[Antonov An-12]], [[Antonov An-24]], [[Cessna]] and [[Let L-410 Turbolet|Let L-410]] into its fleet. Since 1999 Heli Air started to operate primarily on programs of [[United Nations]] and [[World Food Programme]] (UN - WFP), and performed thousands of flying hours in difficult accessible locations and troubled countries such as [[Angola]], [[Guinea]], [[Mozambique]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Afghanistan]] and others.

==Fleet==
The Heli Air fleet includes the following aircraft:

== Stated objectives ==

The stated objectives of the International Decade for People of African Descent are to:
* Promote respect, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by people of African Descent, as recognized in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]];
* Promote a greater knowledge of and respect for the diverse heritage, culture and contribution of people of African descent to the development of societies;
* Adopt and strengthen national, regional and international legal frameworks according to the [[Durban Declaration and Programme of Action]] and the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] and to ensure their full and effective implementation.&lt;ref name=planaction /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol8no1/8.1-20-UN.pdf "UN International Decade for People of African Descent: 2015-2024"], ''The Journal of Pan African Studies'', vol. 8, no. 1, June 2015, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The seeds of the International Decade for People of African Descent were sewn in 2001 with the third World Conference against Racism, which led to the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UN Launches International Decade for People of African Descent|url = http://www.ijrcenter.org/2015/01/27/un-launches-international-decade-for-people-of-african-descent/|website = International Justice Resource Center|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Durban Declaration, in addition to declaring that the people of Africa had been victimized by slavery and continued to suffer as a result, called for states to adopt specific steps to help combat racism and [[xenophobia]] and to protect its victims. During the [[International Year for People of African Descent]], ten years later, the UN called for these efforts to intensify. Two years later, in December 2013, the UN resolved that 1 January 2015 would launch the International Decade for People of African Descent.

On its launch, the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Flavia Pansieri]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road to a world free from racism, prejudice and stigma is rocky. Combating racial discrimination is a long-term effort. It requires commitment and persistence. People of African descent need encouragement and support. Member States have the moral and legal obligation to provide sustained political and financial backing to make the Decade effective an[d] to continue our path toward equal and just societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijrcenter.org/2015/01/27/un-launches-international-decade-for-people-of-african-descent/ "UN Launches International Decade for People of African Descent"], International Justice Resource Center, 27 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15432&amp;LangID=E Statement by Flavia Pansieri, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights at Launch of the International Decade for People of African Descent], Geneva, PN Cinema Room XIV, 16 December 2014. United Nations Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Activity within different nations ==
===Accompong===
In 2017 the [[Accompong]] Maroons launched the [[Door of Return]] Initiative in cooperation with Ghana and Nigeria&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atqnews.com/ng/4-nations-door-drive-tourism-diaspora/&lt;/ref&gt; for which Nigeria unveiled the first symbolic monument during its Diaspora Festival in Badagry&lt;ref&gt;https://guardian.ng/art/abike-dabiri-erewa-others-endorse-badagry-diaspora-festival-door-of-return-ceremony/&lt;/ref&gt;. The initiative involves erecting a series of monuments across Africa to signify the openness of Africa towards the Diaspora, and is intended to bring new investment to the continent in areas of tourism and sustainable infrastructure development&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/-Door-of-Return--monument-to-be-erected-in-Accompong-Town&lt;/ref&gt;.      

===United States===
In 2015 the UN marked the beginning of the International Decade for People of African Descent by unveiling a "Permanent Memorial for the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade" on 25 March, [[International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade]], at [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]. The memorial, entitled ''The Ark of Return'' is by [[Haitian-American]] architect [[Rodney Leon]], who also designed the [[African Burial Ground National Monument]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO26Mar2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unveiling of the Permanent Memorial to Honour the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade at the United Nations|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/opening_of_the_permanent_memorial_for_the_victims_of_slavery_and_the_transatlantic_slave_trade_at_the_united_nations/#.V6ypN1UrKgB|website=UNESCO.org|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this activity is located in the US, it is a UN activity that is not sponsored by the United States.

=== United Kingdom ===
So far, the British government has no plans to mark the International Decade for People of African Descent. Its official response only refers to the UK's generic anti-discrimination policies, it makes no specific reference to Africa or people of African descent living in Britain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">The '''Kabiye''', also known as '''Kabye''', '''Kabre''', '''Cabrai'''', are a people living in the north central mountains and northern plains of [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p625"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paul533/&gt; They speak the [[Kabiye language]]. The Kabye are primarily known for farming and cultivation of harsh, dry, infertile lands of Togo. They grow cotton, millet and yams.&lt;ref name=paul533&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Humphrey et al|title=Peoples of Africa, Volume 10: Togo-Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlz2bWRPmvgC&amp;pg=PA533|year=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7168-4|page=533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabye people also live in northwestern [[Benin]] near the Togolese border. The [[Lukpa language|Logba or Lugba]] people of [[Benin]] are closely related to the Kabye. Broadly defined and subgroups included, the Kabiye people are the second largest ethnic group after the [[Ewe people]], and they dominate the government and military of Togo.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p625"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
The Kabye are a patrilineal society that has been primarily devoted to subsistence farming. In contemporary economy, many are migrant labor.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p625"/&gt;

===Evala wrestling===
{{main|Lutte traditionnelle}}
Evala is a form of traditional wrestling practised mainly by the Kabyé of northern Togo, in West Africa. Competitors meet yearly at a festival following a retreat marking the initiation of young men into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Hudgens, Richard Trillo, and Nathalie Calonnec (2003). The rough guide to West Africa (4th ed.). Rough Guides. {{ISBN|1-84353-118-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Pitcher, David Andrew, Kate Armstrong, James Bainbridge, Tim Bewer, and Jean-Bernard Carillet (2007). Africa (11th ed.). Lonely Planet. pp. 524. {{ISBN|1-74104-482-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evala is the penultimate element of this initiation rite, during which young men are separated from their families for one week, residing in special huts where they are fed and subject to mental training. Prior to wrestling, participants go on a pilgrimage which involves climbing three mountains; those who do not complete it are not initiated into adulthood. Although wrestlers are initiated regardless of whether they win or not, losing is considered shameful to the family name. The last of these initiation rites is circumcision.

==Notable people==
The country's former president, [[Gnassingbé Eyadema]], who took power in a coup, was of Kabye ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p625"/&gt; Togo is now led by Eyadema's son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]].

Defined in an area of {{convert|10,908|km2|sqmi}}, Kosovo is [[landlocked]] in the center of the [[Balkans]] and bordered by the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the southeast, [[Albania]] to the southwest and [[Montenegro]] to the west.

[[Geography of Kosovo|Geographically]], Kosovo possesses varied and opposing landscapes for such a small country determined by the ideal [[Climate of Kosovo|climate]] along with the [[geology]] and [[hydrology]]. Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains of [[Dukagjini Plain|Dukagjin]] and [[Kosovo field (Kosovo)|Kosovo]]. The [[Albanian Alps]] and [[Sharr Mountains]] rise in the southwest and southeast respectively.
 
The [[History of Kosovo|history]] of Kosovo dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] era, represented by the [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] and [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] cultures. During the [[classical antiquity|Classical]] period, it was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]]-[[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanian]] and [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Celtic]] people.

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 15th to the early 20th century. In the late 19th century, it became the centre of the [[Albanian National Awakening]]. Following their defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]], the Ottomans [[Treaty of London (1913)|ceded]] Kosovo to Serbia and Montenegro. Both countries joined [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after [[World War I]], and following a period of [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav unitarianism]] in the Kingdom, the post-[[World War II]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] constitution established the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]] within the Yugoslav constituent Republic of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]. Tensions between Kosovo's Albanian and Serb communities simmered through the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, culminating in the [[Kosovo War]] of 1998 and 1999, which resulted in the withdrawal of the [[Army of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] and the establishment of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]].

The entire region that today corresponds to the territory is commonly referred to in [[English language|English]] simply as ''Kosovo'' and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Kosova'' or ''Kosovë'' ([[Albanian grammar|definite form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːva}}) or ''{{lang|sq|Kosovë}}'' ([[Albanian grammar|"indefinite" form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːv}}). In Serbia, a formal distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo}}'' ({{lang|sr|Косово}}) is used for the eastern part centred on the historical [[Kosovo field (region)|Kosovo Field]], while the western part is called ''[[Metohija]]'' ({{lang|sr|Метохија}}) (known as ''Dukagjini'' in Albanian).&lt;ref name="constitution-serbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127021637/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archivedate=27 November 2010 |title=Constitution of the Republic of Serbia |publisher=Parlament.gov.rs |accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory, ''Kosovo'' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Косово}}, {{IPA-sr|kôsoʋo}}) is the Serbian neuter [[possessive adjective]] of ''kos'' (кос) "[[Turdus merula|blackbird]]", an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] for ''Kosovo Polje'', 'blackbird field', the name of [[Kosovo field (region)|a plain]] situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo and the site of the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo Field]].&lt;ref name="Inc.2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=IBP, Inc.|title=Kosovo Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|date=June 2015

[[Albanians]] also refer to Kosovo as [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]], the name of a Roman province formed in 165 BC, which covered the territory of modern Kosovo. The name is derived from ancient tribe of [[Dardani]], ultimately from proto-Albanian word ''dardha/dardā'' which means "pear".&lt;ref&gt;Albanian Etymological Dictionary, V.Orel, Koninklijke Brill, Leiden Boston Köln 1998, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The former Kosovo President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] had been an enthusiastic backer of a "Dardanian" identity and the Kosovan flag and presidential seal refer to this national identity. However, the name "Kosova" remains more widely used among the Albanian population.

The current borders of Kosovo were drawn while part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in 1945, when the [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963)]] was created as an administrative division of the new [[People's Republic of Serbia]]. In 1963, it was raised from the level of an autonomous region to the level of an autonomous province as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1963–1968)]]. In 1968, the dual name "Kosovo and [[Metohija]]" was reduced to a simple "Kosovo" in the name of the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]. In 1990, the province was renamed the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qlXatHRJtMC&amp;pg=PA73 |title=Nation Shapes: The Story Behind the World's Borders |page=73 |last=Shelley |first=Fred M. |isbn=9781610691062 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016003257/https://books.google.com/books?id=5qlXatHRJtMC&amp;pg=PA73 |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyjnesha_muze.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goddess on the Throne]] is one of the most precious archaeological artifacts of Kosovo and has been adopted as the symbol of [[Pristina]].]]

In prehistory, the succeeding [[Starčevo culture]] and [[Vinča culture]] were active in the region.&lt;ref name="Authors 1975, p.43"&gt;{{citation |title= Ferizaj dhe rrethina |first1= Sh. |last1= Ajdini |first2=  Q. |last2= Bytyqi |first3= H. |last3= Bycinca |first4= I. |last4= Dema |first5= S. |last5= Zeqa |first6= As. |last6= Iseni |first7= J. |last7= Mitroviq |displayauthors= 4 |location= Beograd |year= 1975 |pp= 43–45 |ref= {{SfnRef|Ajdini et al.|1975}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} The area in and around Kosovo has been inhabited for nearly 10,000 years. During the [[Neolithic]] age, Kosovo lay within the area of the [[Vinča-Turdaş culture]] which is characterised by West Balkan black and grey pottery. [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] tombs have been found in [[Metohija]].&lt;ref name="Jankovic"&gt;[[Djordje Janković]]: [http://www.rastko.org.rs/kosovo/istorija/malkolm/djankovic-facts.html Middle Ages in Noel Malcolm's "Kosovo.

The favorable position as well as abundant natural resources were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archeological heritage.&lt;ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7"&gt;Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout Kosovo but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7"/&gt;

The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the [[Stone Age]] Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the Radivojce Cave set near the spring of the [[Drin (river)|Drin]] river, then there are some indications at Grnčar Cave in the [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]] municipality, Dema and Karamakaz Caves of [[Peć]] and others. However, human settlement during the [[Paleolithic]] or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven. 

[[File:ULPIANA foto Arben Llapashtica 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Ancient [[Ulpiana]] situated south-east of [[Pristina]]. The city played an important role in the development of one of the most important cities in the Roman province of [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]].]]

Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and [[Mesolithic]] man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory. Whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

During antiquity, the area which now makes up Kosovo was inhabited by various tribal ethnic groups, who were liable to move, enlarge, fuse and fissure with neighbouring groups. As such, it is difficult to locate any such group with precision. The ''Dardani'', whose exact ethno-linguistic affiliation is difficult to determine, were a prominent group in the region during the late Hellenistic and early Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;N G Hammond, ''The Kingdoms of Illyria c. 400&amp;nbsp;– 167 BC.''

Whether the Dardanians were an Illyrian or a Thracian people has been much debated and one view suggests that the area was originally populated with Thracians who {{sic|?|where}} then exposed to direct contact with illyrians over a long period..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"the Dardanians [...] living in the frontiers of the Illyrian and the [[Thracian]] worlds retained their individuality and, alone among the peoples of that region succeeded in maintaining themselves as an ethnic unity even when they were militarily and politically subjected by the Roman arms [...] and when at the end of the ancient world, the Balkans were involved in far-reaching ethnic perturbations, the Dardanians, of all the Central Balkan tribes, played the greatest part in the genesis of the new peoples who took the place of the old" The central Balkan tribes in pre-Roman times: Triballi, Autariatae, Dardanians, Scordisci and Moesians, Amsterdam 1978, by Fanula Papazoglu, {{ISBN|90-256-0793-4}}, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of 'barbarian' raids from the 4th century AD onwards, culminating with the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 6th and 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record,{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}} and whatever was left of the native provincial population fused into the Slavs.&lt;ref name="Stipčević1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aleksandar Stipčević|title=The Illyrians: history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Noyes Press|isbn=978-0-8155-5052-5|page=76|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101053811/https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent political and [[demographic history of Kosovo]] is not known with absolute certainty until the 13th century. Archaeological findings suggest that there was steady population recovery and progression of the [[Slavic culture]] seen elsewhere throughout the [[Balkans]]. The region was absorbed into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 850s, where [[Byzantine culture]] was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018, and became part of the newly established Theme of Bulgaria. As the centre of Slavic resistance to [[Constantinople]] in the region, the region often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other, until Serbian Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] secured it by the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1994, p. 7 {{quote|the Hungarian attack launched in 1183 with which Nemanja was allied [...] was able to conquer Kosovo and Metohija, including Prizren.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An insight into the region is provided by the Byzantine historian-princess, [[Anna Comnena]], who wrote of "Serbs" being the "main" inhabitants of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Comnène, Alexiade&amp;nbsp;– Règne de l'Empereur Alexis I Comnène 1081–1118, texte etabli et traduit par B.

The zenith of Serbian power was reached in 1346, with the formation of the [[Serbian Empire]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo became a political, cultural and religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]]. In the late 13th century, the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Archbishopric]] was moved to [[Peć]], and rulers centred themselves between [[Prizren]] and [[Skopje]],&lt;ref&gt;Denis P Hupchik.

When the Serbian Empire fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities in 1371, Kosovo became the hereditary land of the [[House of Branković]]. In the late 14th and the 15th centuries parts of Kosovo, the easternmost area of which was located near Pristina, were part of the [[Principality of Dukagjini]]{{fact|date=November 2018}}, which was later incorporated into an anti-Ottoman federation of all Albanian principalities, the [[League of Lezhë]].&lt;ref name="Sellers2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=Mortimer|title=The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Rx7_KyUp7cC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=2 February 2011|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-3748-0|page=207|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193103/https://books.google.com/books?id=9Rx7_KyUp7cC&amp;pg=PA207|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sandžak]] region cutting into present-day [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kukës]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] with the city of [[Skopje]] (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]], including larger urban settlements such as [[Štip]] (''İştip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

Such acts of assistance by the Austrian Empire (then arch-rivals of the Ottoman Empire), or Russia, were always abortive or temporary at best.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic.

Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Šar range).&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1994), p. 51.: "The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century. However, organized in tribes under their own chieftains, the Albanians dominated the mountains of most of what we today think of as Albania."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 "In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since the [[Middle Ages]] with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamicisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as northwestern Macedonia, although some might have been autochthonous to the region.{{sfn|Banac|p=46}} However, Banac favours the idea that the main settlers of the time were Vlachs.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}

Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government. "Albanians had little cause of unrest", according to author Dennis Hupchik. "If anything, they grew important in Ottoman internal affairs."&lt;ref name="hupchik"&gt;''The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism'', Dennis Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, there was an [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]] of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans. The underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name="prospect-magazine.co.uk"/&gt; The ethnic [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian nationalism]] movement was centred in Kosovo. In 1878 the [[League of Prizren]] ({{lang|sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit}}) was formed.
This was a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights,&lt;ref&gt;''Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know'' by Tim Judah, Publisher [[Oxford University Press]], US, 2008 {{ISBN|0-19-537673-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-537673-9}} page 36&lt;/ref&gt; although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 "Since Islamicised Albanians represented a significant portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily."&lt;/ref&gt; The League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a [[nation|national identity]] among Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;George Gawlrych, ''The Crescent and the Eagle,'' (Palgrave/Macmilan, London, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84511-287-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian ambitions competed with those of the Serbs. The [[Kingdom of Serbia]] wished to incorporate this land that had formerly been within its empire.

The [[Young Turk]] movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after a coup in 1912 which deposed Sultan [[Abdul Hamid&amp;nbsp;II]]. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire. An allegiance to [[Ottomanism]] was promoted instead.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher, Ottoman sources of Kemalist thought, (New York, Routledge, 2004), Page. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; An Albanian uprising in 1912 exposed the empire's northern territories in Kosovo and [[Novi Pazar]], which led to an invasion by the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. [[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Albanians in 1912, culminating in the Ottoman loss of most of its Albanian-inhabited lands. The Albanians threatened to march all the way to [[Salonika]] and reimpose Abdul Hamid.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1998), Page 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wave of Albanians in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. In September 1912, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most of their European possessions. The rise of nationalism unfortunately hampered relations between Albanians and [[Serbs in Kosovo]], due to influence from Russians, Austrians and Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;See: Isa Blumi, ''Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and Political History of Albania and Yemen, 1878–1918''

So the population of Serbs in Kosovo fell after World War&amp;nbsp;II, but it had increased considerably before then.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A short history of Kosovo'', (London, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society.&lt;ref name = "Schabnel 2001 20"&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur, Ramesh (eds).

In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria–Hungary|Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia ([[Zvečan]], Kosovo and southern [[Metohija]]) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Raška and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.&lt;ref name = "Schabnel 2001 20"/&gt;

After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312&lt;/ref&gt; An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Frank|first = Chaim|editor1-last = Petersen|editor1-first = Hans-Christian|editor2-last = Salzborn|editor2-first = Samuel|year = 2010|title = Antisemitism in Eastern Europe: History and Present in Comparison|publisher = Peter Lang|location = [[Bern]]|isbn = 978-3-631-59828-3|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|pp = 97–98|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016003257/https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|archivedate = 16 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not disputed that between 1941 and 1945 tens of thousands of Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo.

The province as in its outline today first took shape in 1945 as the ''Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area''. Until World War II, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo had been a political unit carved from the former [[vilayet]] which bore no special significance to its internal population. In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of southwest Serbia.

Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to ethnic tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

Pp. 35"/&gt; High-ranking Serbian communist official [[Aleksandar Ranković]] sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]].&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35"/&gt; At the same time Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35"/&gt; Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, accusing the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo as being colonialist, as well as demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35"/&gt;

After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia, succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a [[Bosniaks|Muslim Yugoslav]] nationality.&lt;ref name="Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

Pp. 296"/&gt; Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Pristina]] as an [[Albanian language]] institution.&lt;ref name="Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

[[File:SocialistYugoslavia en.svg|right|thumb|Republics and provinces of the SFR Yugoslavia]]
In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [[League of Prizren]].&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35"/&gt; Albanians felt that their status as a "minority" in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the "nations" of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a [[Constituent state|constituent republic]], alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36"&gt;Independent International Commission on Kosovo. ''The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned''. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[1981 protests in Kosovo|Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo]] resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36"/&gt; In the aftermath of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded&amp;nbsp;– including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.&lt;ref name="Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36"/&gt;

Due to very high [[birth rate]]s, the proportion of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents with their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassment have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example, in 1986 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'genocide'.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215 |title=Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity: An Introduction |publisher=New York University Press |accessdate=20 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-8147-6701-6 |editor-last=Prentiss |editor-first=Craig R |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they were disproved by police statistics,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2014}} they received wide attention in the Serbian press and that led to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia and demanding their human rights.&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested.&lt;ref name="hdk"&gt;[[Robert Elsie|Elsie, Robert]].

Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8108-5309-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities, resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name="nyt19870627"&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]], employing a mix of intimidation and political manoeuvring, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population.&lt;ref name="rogel"&gt;Rogel, Carole.

Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307072437/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm |date=7 March 2016 }} ", ''BBC News'', 9 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UN Security Council Resolution]] which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702211016/http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|archivedate=2 July 2007 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a "[[wikt:troika|Troika]]" consisting of negotiators from the European Union ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States ([[Frank G. Wisner]]) and [[Russia]] (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina.

After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]] who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]], and stated his intention to declare independence.

On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a proposal by Serbia, to ask the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The advisory opinion, which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law&amp;nbsp;– in particular UNSCR 1244&amp;nbsp;– which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.&lt;ref name="icj-cij"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;code=kos&amp;case=141&amp;k=21|title=Advisory Proceedings&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;International Court of Justice|publisher=icj-cij.org|accessdate=3 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208141833/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;code=kos&amp;case=141&amp;k=21|archivedate=8 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo is landlocked and located in the center of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It is defined in a total area of {{convert|10,908|km2|0|abbr=off}}. Kosovo lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[22nd meridian east|22° E]]. Kosovo is encircled by [[Albania]] to the south and southwest, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the southeast, [[Montenegro]] to the west and [[Serbia]] to the north, northeast and east.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |publisher=CIA |date=19 June 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306223735/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html |archivedate=6 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's northernmost point is Bellobërda at 43° 14' 06" northern latitude; the southernmost is Restelica at 41° 56' 40" northern latitude; the westernmost point is [[Bogë, Kosovo|Bogë]] at 20° 3' 23" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is [[Desivojca]] at 21° 44' 21" eastern longitude.

Most of the Kosovo's borders are dominated by mountainous or high terrain. The most noticeable [[Topography|topographical]] features are the [[Prokletije]] and the [[Šar Mountains]]. The Prokletije, also known as the Albanian Alps or Bjeshkët e Nemuna, are a geological continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with Albania and Montenegro. The southeast is predominantly the Šar Mountains, which form the border with the Republic of Macedonia. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo's territory consists mostly of two major plains: the [[Kosovo Plain]] in the east and the [[Metohija|Metohija Plain]] in the west.

Kosovo's hydrological resources are relatively small. The longest rivers of Kosovo include the [[White Drin]], the [[South Morava]] and the [[Ibar River|Ibar]]. [[Sitnica]], a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo's territory. River [[Nerodimka (river)|Nerodimka]] represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Aegean Sea]].{{Clear}}

The coldest areas of Kosovo are the mountains in the west and southeast, where an alpine climate is found. The warmest areas are mostly in the extreme southern areas close to the border with Albania, characterised by the Mediterranean climate. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|0|°C|°F|lk=on}} (in January) and {{convert|22|°C|°F|lk=off}} (in July). Mean annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|600|to|1300|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, and is well distributed year-round.

To the northeast, the [[Kosovo Plain]] and [[Ibar (river)|Ibar Valley]] are drier with total precipitation of about {{convert|600|mm|abbr=off}} per year and more influenced by continental air masses, with colder winters and very hot summers. In the southwest, climatic area of [[Metohija]] receives more mediterranean influences with warmer summers, somewhat higher precipitation ({{convert|700|mm|in|abbr=on}}) and heavy snowfalls in the winter. The mountainous areas of [[Prokletije]] in the west, [[Šar Mountains]] on the south and [[Kopaonik]] in the north experiences alpine climate, with high precipitation ({{convert|900|to|1300|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, short and fresh summers, and cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/climate.html |title=Climatic Conditions |publisher=Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals of Kosovo |accessdate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212027/https://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/climate.html |archivedate=27 May 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature of Kosovo is {{convert|9.5|C|F}}.

Kosovo is divided into seven [[Districts of Kosovo|districts]] ({{lang-sq|rajon}}; {{lang-sr|okrug}}), according to the Law of Kosovo and the Brussels Agreement of 2013, which stipulated the formation of new municipalities with Serb majority populations. The districts are further subdivided into 38 [[Municipalities of Kosovo|municipalities]] (''{{lang|sq|komunë}}''; ''{{lang|sr|opština}}''). The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the [[District of Pristina]] with the capital in [[Pristina]], having a surface area of {{convert|2470|km2|sqmi|lk=in|sigfig=5}} and a population of 477,312.

Kosovo is a [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[parliamentary republic|republic]]. It is governed by [[legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] institutions which derive from the [[Constitution of Kosovo|constitution]], although until the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|Brussels Agreement]], North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia. The legislative is vested in both the [[Assembly of Kosovo|Parliament]] and the ministers within their competencies. The [[Government of Kosovo|Government]] exercises the executive power and is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]] as the [[head of government]], the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.

The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and independent prosecutorial institutions. There also exist multiple independent institutions defined by the constitution and law, as well as local governments. It specifies that Kosovo is a "[[secular state]]" and neutral in matters of religious beliefs. Freedom of belief, conscience and religion is guaranteed with religious autonomy ensured and protected. All citizens are equal before the law and [[gender equality]] is ensured by the constitution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WX4hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;q=kosovo%20no%20official%20religion|title=The Road to Independence for Kosovo: A Chronicle of the Ahtisaari Plan|first=Henry H.

The [[Albania–Kosovo relations|relations with Albania]] are in a special case, considering that the two share the same language. The [[Albanian language]] is one of the [[Languages of Kosovo|official languages]] of Kosovo. [[Albania]] has an embassy in the capital [[Pristina]] and Kosovo an embassy in [[Tirana]]. In 1992, Albania was the only country whose parliament voted to recognise the [[Republic of Kosova]]. [[Albania]] was also one of the first countries to officially announce its recognition of the Republic of Kosovo in February 2008.

The [[Global Peace Index]] 2015 ranked Kosovo 69th out of 163 countries. The [[President of Kosovo|President]] holds the title of commander-in-chief of the military. Citizens over the age of 18 are eligible to serve in the [[Kosovo Security Force]].

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of Kosovo|EULEX}}

[[File:KP-PK During Kosovo Independence Parade.JPG|thumb|The [[Kosovo Police|Kosovan Police]] (''Policia e Kosovës'') is the main law enforcement agency in Kosovo.]]

The judicial system of Kosovo is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.

The [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.
The declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.

=== Minorities ===

The relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo-Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovo-Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

The population of Kosovo was estimated to be around 1.9 and 2.2 million wherein the [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]] constitute the largest [[ethnic group]]s followed by other groups such as [[Bosniak people|Bosniak]], [[Gorani people|Gorani]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309073836/http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2008 |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the 2009 [[CIA World Factbook]], Kosovo's population stands at 1,804,838 persons. It stated that ethnic composition was 88% [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanians]], 7% [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serbs]] and 5% of other ethnic groups including Bosniaks, Gorani, Roma, Turks, Ashkalis, Egyptians and [[Janjevci|Janjevci&amp;nbsp;– Croats]].&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not quite coincide with the ethnic boundary by which Albanians compose an absolute majority in every municipality; for example, Serbs form a local majority in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|two other municipalities]], while there are large areas with an Albanian majority outside of Kosovo, namely in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia: the north-west of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and in the [[Preševo Valley]] in Southern Serbia.

[[Christianity in Kosovo|Christianity]] has a long and continuous history in Kosovo which can be traced back to the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of the region. During the early and late Middle Ages, the entire [[Balkan Peninsula]] has been [[Christianized]] initially by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s and subsequently by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. The people who follow the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are predominantly Albanians while Serbs follow the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. 

The relations between the Albanian Muslim and Roman Catholic communities in Kosovo are considered as good, but both communities have few or no relations with the Serbian Orthodox community. The Kosovo Albanians define their [[ethnicity]] by [[language]] and not by religion while religion reflects a distinguishing identity feature among the Kosovo Slaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion in Kosovo |date=2001 |location=Pristina and Brussels |page=3 |edition=International Crisis Group |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economy of Kosovo|economy]] of Kosovo is a transition economy. It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the following [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav wars]], the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and international sanctions on Serbia of which it was then part. Since the independence in 2008, the economy has grown every year. Despite declining foreign assistance, growth of [[GDP]] averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the [[Global financial crisis of 2007-08|global financial crisis of 2009]] and the subsequent [[Eurozone]] crisis. Additionally, the [[inflation rate]] has been low. The most economic development, has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the [[Albanian diaspora|Diaspora]], [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] and other capital inflows.&lt;ref name="IMF Country Report No 12/100"&gt; '' IMF Country Report No 12/100 '' {{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924054059/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }} "Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the Rahovec facility that held approximately 36% of the total vineyard area had the capacity of around 50 million litres annually. The major share of the wine production was intended for exports. At its peak in 1989, the exports from the Rahovec facility amounted to 40 million litres and were mainly distributed to the German market.&lt;ref name="wine"&gt;{{cite web|title= Investing in Kosovo – Vineyards|url= http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/investing_in_kosovo/content/iguide_3.html|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130404212338/http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/investing_in_kosovo/content/iguide_3.html|archivedate= 4 April 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Kosovo}}

[[File:Brezovica run.jpg|thumb|[[Brezovica, Kosovo|Brezovica]] is one of the most visited winter tourist destinations in Kosovo.]]

The natural values of Kosovo represents quality tourism resources. The description of Kosovo's potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the center of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical times]]. Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southern Europe]], the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism. Skiing takes place at the winter resort of [[Brezovica, Kosovo|Brezovica]] within the [[Šar Mountains]].&lt;ref name=turizmi&gt;{{cite web|title= Investing in Kosovo|url= http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/InvestinginKosovo_2011_Web.pdf|page= 15|accessdate= 27 February 2014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104072918/http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/InvestinginKosovo_2011_Web.pdf|archivedate= 4 November 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features including high [[mountain]]s, [[lake]]s, [[canyon]]s, steep [[rock formation]]s and [[river]]s.&lt;ref name=turizmi /&gt; [[Brezovica, Kosovo|Brezovica]], with the close proximity to the [[Pristina Airport]] (60&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Skopje International Airport]] (70&amp;nbsp;km), the resort is a possible destination for international tourists. Other major attractions include the modern capital of [[Pristina]], the historical cities of [[Prizren]], [[Peć]] and [[Gjakova]] but also [[Ferizaj]] and [[Gjilan]].

[[The New York Times]] included Kosovo on the list of 41 places to visit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/travel/09where-to-go.html | work=The New York Times | title=The 41 Places to Go in 2011 | date=7 January 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202331/http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/travel/09where-to-go.html | archivedate=11 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatmagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=510&amp;Itemid&amp;ed=22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804085239/http://www.diplomatmagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=510&amp;Itemid&amp;ed=22 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Motorways in Kosovo}}

[[File:Prishtina International Airport "Adem Jashari" Limak Kosovo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pristina International Airport]] (PRN) handles more than 1.7 million passengers per year.]]

Currently, there are two main motorways in Kosovo including the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway|R7]] connecting Kosovo with [[Albania]] and the [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6]] connecting [[Pristina]] with the Macedonian border at [[Elez Han]]. The construction of the new [[R7.1 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7.1 Motorway]] began in 2017.

The [[R7 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7 Motorway]] (part of [[Albania-Kosovo Highway]]) links Kosovo to [[Albania]]'s [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast in [[Durrës]]. Once the remaining [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] from [[Pristina]] to [[Merdare]] section project will be completed, the motorway will link Kosovo through the present [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] highway with the [[Pan-European corridor X]] ([[European route E75|E75]]) near [[Niš]] in Serbia. The [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6 Motorway]] is currently under construction. Forming part of the [[European route E65|E65]], it is the second motorway constructed in the region and it links the capital [[Pristina]] with the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] border at [[Elez Han]], which is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from [[Skopje]]. Construction of the motorway started in 2014 and it is going to be finished in 2018.

The nation hosts two airports, the [[Gjakova Airport]] and the only [[Pristina International Airport|International Airport of Pristina]]. The Gjakova Airport was built by the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) following the [[Kosovo War]], next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership with the aim of turning it into a civilian and commercial airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aktivitetet e Ministrisë së Tregtisë dhe Industrisë: Themelohet Ndërmarrja Publike "Aeroporti i Gjakovës"|url=http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|publisher=Ministria e Tregtisë dhe Industrisë|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170445/http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pristina International Airport]] is located southwest of [[Pristina]]. It is Kosovo's only international airport and the only port of entry for air travelers to Kosovo.

=== Health ===
{{main|Health care in Kosovo|l1=Health in Kosovo}}

In the past, Kosovo's capabilities to develop a modern [[health care]] system were limited.&lt;ref name="Sectorial Health Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategjia Sektoriale e Shendetesise |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Strategjia_e_Sektorit_te_Shendetesise_2010-2014.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Health&amp;nbsp;– Republic of Kosovo |accessdate=2 March 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Low [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] during 1990 worsened the situation even more. However, the establishment of Faculty of Medicine in the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Pristina]] marked a significant development in health care. This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development.&lt;ref name="Sectorial Health Strategy"/&gt;

Nowadays the situation has changed, and the health care system in Kosovo is organised into three sectors: [[Primary health care|primary]], secondary and tertiary health care.&lt;ref name="Sectorial Health Care Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategjia Sektoriale e Shendetesise |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Strategjia_e_Sektorit_te_Shendetesise_2010-2014.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Health |accessdate=2 March 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Primary health care in [[Pristina]] is organised into thirteen family medicine centres&lt;ref name="prishtina-komuna.org"&gt;QKMF. (2010–2014). Njesite me Adresa dhe Nr.Telefonit.

Pristina does not have any regional hospital and instead uses University Clinical Center of Kosovo for health care services. University Clinical Center of Kosovo provides its health care services in twelve clinics,&lt;ref name="Stafi i QKUK-se"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stafi i QKUK-se |url=http://qkuk.org/stafi/ |publisher=QKUK |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306190904/http://qkuk.org/stafi/ |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where 642 doctors are employed.&lt;ref name="2012 Health Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistikat e Shëndetësisë  2012 |url=https://esk.rks-gov.net/shendetsia/doc_view/1066-statistikat-e-shaeumlndetaeumlsisaeuml-2012?tmpl=component&amp;format=raw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302190734/https://esk.rks-gov.net/shendetsia/doc_view/1066-statistikat-e-shaeumlndetaeumlsisaeuml-2012?tmpl=component&amp;format=raw |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 March 2014 |publisher=Kosovo Agency of Statistics |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a lower level, home services are provided for several vulnerable groups which are not able to reach health care premises.&lt;ref name="Home Services"&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATË&amp;nbsp;– 13 shkurt 2012|url=http://kk.rks-gov.net/prishtina/News/INFORMATE.aspx|publisher=Municipality of Prishtina&amp;nbsp;– Republic of Kosovo|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706004640/http://kk.rks-gov.net/prishtina/News/INFORMATE.aspx|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo health care services are now focused on patient safety, quality control and assisted health.&lt;ref name="Patient Safety and Quality Control"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategjia e permiresimit te cilesise se sherbimeve shendetesore 2012–2016|url=http://msh-ks.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Strategjia-e-permiresimit-te-cilesise-dhe-sigurise-se-SHSH-2012-2016.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Health&amp;nbsp;– Republic of Kosovo|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306192356/http://msh-ks.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Strategjia-e-permiresimit-te-cilesise-dhe-sigurise-se-SHSH-2012-2016.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honorary members include the [[Albanian Americans|Albanian-American]] Nobel Prize winner [[Ferid Murad]] and the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian]] [[Roman Catholic]] nun [[Mother Teresa]].]]

Education for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]]. Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education and higher education.

The primary and secondary education is subdivided into four stages: preschool education, primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and special education. Preschool education is for children from the ages of one to five. Primary and secondary education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognized minorities in Kosovo, where classes are held in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Serbian, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The first phase (primary education) includes grades one to five, and the second phase (low secondary education) grades six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consists of general education but also professional education, which is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]], children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elementary and secondary education|url=https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|website=rks-gov.net|language=English|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818111807/https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=dmy-all|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education can be received in universities and other higher-education institutes. These educational institutions offer studies for [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees. The students may choose full-time or part-time studies.

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Kosovan cuisine}}

[[File:Ushqim_Tradicional_Flija.JPG|thumb|right|[[Flia]] is one of the most favored dishes of the traditional [[Albanian cuisine]] in Kosovo.]]

The [[Kosovan cuisine]] is a mixed cuisine with influences of the [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Serbian]] origins of the country's majority population. Located at crossroad of [[Albanian people|Albanian]], [[Ottoman people|Ottoman]], [[Italic peoples|Romance]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] cultures, Kosovo has enriched its own cuisine adopting and maintaining some of their cooking traditions and techniques.

Food is an important component in the social life of the people of Kosovo particularly during [[religious holiday]]s such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Ramadan]]. For festive occasions, [[Baklava]], [[Lokum]] and [[Halva]] are traditionally prepared in almost every household throughout Kosovo and the [[Balkans]] regardless of ethnicity or cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://rebibneenun.blogdetik.com/embelsira-kosovare/&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most prominent and traditional examples of Kosovan food include the [[Flia]] and Pite which are served with assorted [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit preserves]], honey and [[yogurt]]. Flia is composed of multiple layered [[crepe]] and is predominantly brushed with cream while Pite are filled with a mixture of salty [[cheese]], [[meat]], [[potato]]es or [[leek]].

The cuisine of Kosovo features a wide range of fresh [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[herb]]s such as [[salt]], [[Bell pepper|red]] and [[black pepper]] and vegeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131108/http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Kosovo enjoy a wide variety of meat and [[fish]] products among other [[chicken]], [[beef]], [[kebab]], [[Sujuk|suxhuk]] and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] which is considered to be the traditional meat for religious occasions due to its religious connections. 
   
[[Tea]] such as Albanian-style [[Sideritis|mountain tea]] or Russian and Turkish-style [[black tea]] are a widely consumed beverage throughout the country and particularly served at cafés, restaurants or at home. [[Coffee]] is another popular drink although the country is steeped in culture and their coffee culture is a big part of the modern society of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COFFEE CULTURE IS ROOTED IN OUR SOCIETY |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/coffee-culture-rooted-society/ |website=kosovotwopointzero.com |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport is a significant component of the society and culture of Kosovo. The most prominent sports in Kosovo include [[football]], [[basketball]], [[judo]], [[boxing]], [[volleyball]] and [[handball]]. The [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo]] became a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Olympic recognition"&gt;{{cite news|title=127th IOC Session comes to close in Monaco|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/127th-ioc-session-comes-to-close-in-monaco/242155|accessdate=9 December 2014|publisher=olympic.org|date=9 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104235120/http://www.olympic.org/news/127th-ioc-session-comes-to-close-in-monaco/242155|archivedate=4 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It participated at the [[2015 European Games]] in [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Brazil]].

The most popular [[sport]] in Kosovo is [[football]] by far. It was first codified in 1946. In 1922, the first clubs were formed such as the FC Gjakova and [[FC Prishtina]]. During the [[Cold War|cold war]] era from 1945 until 1991, football in [[former Yugoslavia]] was advancing so fast that in 1946 it was formed the [[Football Federation of Kosovo|Federation of Kosovo]], as a subsidiary of the Federation of Yugoslavia. Prishtina became the most successful club in the ''First Leagues of Yugoslavia'', while [[KF Trepça]] was part of the league for one year. In 1991, the first independent Federation of Kosovo were founded, after all football players, almost from Kosovo, were banned from the League in Yugoslavia. The first game was held in the stadium of [[KF Flamurtari|Flamurtari]] on 13 September 1991 in [[Pristina]], which marked in the same time the start of the first independent championship in Kosovo. The governing body is mainly responsible for [[Kosovo national football team|national team]] and the most main cup competitions.&lt;ref name="History of Football in Kosovo"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Football in Kosovo|url=http://korneri.net/?p=60042|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302195907/http://korneri.net/?p=60042|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 March 2014|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, epic poetry in Kosovo and [[Northern Albania]] was sung on a lahuta and then a more tuneful çiftelia was used which has two strings-one for the melody and one for drone. Kosovan music is influenced by Turkish music due to the almost 500-year span of Ottoman rule in Kosovo though Kosovan folklore has preserved its originality and exemplary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knaus, Warrander|first=Verena, Gail|title=Kosovo|year=2010|publisher=Brad Travel Guides|location=Kosovo|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological researches tells about how old is this tradition and how was it developed in parallel way with other traditional music in the Balkan.

The architecture of Kosovo dates back to the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Middle Age]]s. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilizations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.

Kosovo is home to many [[Monastery|Monasteries]] and Churches from the 13th and 14th century that represents the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] legacy. Architectural heritage from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Period]] includes mosques and [[Turkish bath|hamams]] from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include [[Monuments of Kosovo|kullas]] from the 18th and 19th centuries as well as a number of bridges, urban centers and fortresses. While some [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular buildings]] are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the [[Kosovo War|1999 conflict in Kosovo]], many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prioritized Intervention List|journal=Regional Programme for Cultural and Natural Heritage in South-east Europe|date=23 January 2009|page=8|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302202142/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultural Heritage in South-East: Kosovo|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|page=5|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322132708/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2004, [[UNESCO]] recognized the [[Visoki Dečani|Visoki Dečani monastery]] as [[World Heritage Site]] for its outstanding universal value.

Kosovan art was unknown to the international public for a very long time, because of the regime, many artists were unable to display their art in art galleries, and so were always on the lookout for alternatives, and even resorted to taking matters into their own hands. Until 1990, artists from Kosovo presented their art in many prestigious worldwide renowned centers. They were affirmed and evaluated highly because of their unique approach to the arts considering the circumstances in which they were created, making them distinguished and original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/news/2015/august/photography-academic-invited-by-president-to-attend-ceremony-for-popstar-rita-ora.aspx|title=Photography academic invited by President to attend ceremony for popstar Rita Ora|website=www.dmu.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congress2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Library of Congress|title=Library of Congress Subject Headings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij47KwlCAykC&amp;pg=PA4303|year=2010|publisher=Library of Congress|pages=4303–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Copied Content from "Cinema of Kosovo" --&gt;
The film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s. In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

The International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organized in August in [[Prizren]] which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organized festival films are screened twice a day in three open air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010 Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.In 2010 Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 Dokufest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820055759/http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 |date=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3219">'''Laoshang''' ({{zh|c=老上}}; r. 174&amp;ndash;160 BCE), whose proper name was '''Jiyu''' ({{zh|c=稽粥}}), was a [[Chanyu]] of the [[Xiongnu Empire]] who succeeded his father [[Modu Chanyu]]. During his reign the expansion of Xiongnu power expanded; the [[Yuezhi]] were defeated, and the Xiongnu thus gained control of the [[Hexi Corridor]].

In 177 or 176 BCE, following direction from his father Modu (Mao-tun), Lao-sheng was "to put an end to the danger of the Yueh-chih, make their king's skull into a drinking cup, chasing them from Kansu, and force them emigrate westward."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laoshang in Chinese means "old and elevated' and is probably a translation from a Xiongnu title, but might represent an attempt to phonetically represent a Xiongnu word.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsewé (1979), p. 120, n. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 162 BCE, the Xiongnu defeated the Yuezhi for the fourth time.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin (2007), pp. 71–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; After this defeat, the majority of the Yuezhi (referred to by the Chinese as the Da Yuezhi) fled to the northwest and settled in the region of the [[Ili River]], while a smaller group (referred to by the Chinese as the ''Xiao Yuezhi'' = "Lesser" or "Smaller" Yuezhi) fled into the southern mountains and settled amongst some of the [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] tribes.

The [[Records of the Grand Historian|''Shiji'']] chap. 110 says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Shortly after this, Maodun died and his son Jizhu was set up with the title of Old ''Shanyu''. When Jizhu became ''Shanyu'' [in 174 BCE], Emperor Wen sent a princess of the imperial family to be his consort, dispatching a eunuch from Yan named [[Zhonghang Yue]] to accompany her as her tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1993), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(28 June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Despite sources that should know declaring Scots to be the '80th' language Harry Potter is available in, this is not the case. Scots was the 80th ''official translation''—6 of which have been a second translation into the same language. It's also worth noting that not all 7 books are available in all 74 languages. Consequently, the number of languages ''the first'' Harry Potter book is available in is 74 + the original English:

'''Montenegrin Symphony Orchestra''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: Crnogorski simfonijski orkestar/Црногорски симфонијски оркестар) began working in September 2007. It is one of the most important and most complex segments of the Montenegrin Music Center. Since its artistical and organisational foundation started on a completely new base, its appearance succeeded almost fifty years of lasting work from the Symphony and Chamber ensemble, which was the part of [[RTCG|Radio and Television of Montenegro]].

Musical Director and Chief Conductor of the Montenegrin Symphony Orchestra is Russian conductor [[Grigory Krasko]].

"'''Oben am jungen Rhein'''" ({{Lang-en|"High on the young [[Rhine]]"}}) has been the [[national anthem]] of [[Liechtenstein]] since 1920. It shares the same melody as the United Kingdom's national anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]", and [[Norway]]'s [[royal anthem]], "[[Kongesangen]]", the only difference being an additional refrain at the end of the song.

==History==
The original lyrics were written in 1850 by Swiss pastor Jakob Josef Jauch (1802–1859),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cantorion.org/pieces/2988/Up-above-the-young-Rhine-%28Oben-am-jungen-Rhein%29|title= Up above the young Rhine (Oben am jungen Rhein)|publisher= Cantorian|accessdate= 26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the Principality of Liechtenstein, which is considered the last remnant of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]], was a member of the [[German Confederation]]. About a decade earlier, French claims to the left bank of the Rhine ([[Rhine Crisis]] of 1840) had triggered a series of German "Rhine songs". "Oben am jungen Rhein" was a number of early national anthems with the same tune as "[[God Save the Queen]]", but the only one that continues to use the tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.classical-music.com/article/five-intriguing-national-anthems| title= Five intriguing national anthems|last=Pound|first=Jeremy| publisher=ClassicalMusic.com| date=16 February 2016| accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34052000| title= How many national anthems are plagiarised?| work=[[BBC News]]| date=26 August 2015| accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, it was shortened (including explicitly Christian passages), and references to [[Germany]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/li.htm| title= Liechtenstein|publisher= nationalanthems.info|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenEZX''' is a project, which tries to gather information about the [[Linux]] based [[Motorola]] EZX phone platform.

It tries to provide a 100% free software stack for those phones, especially a way to avoid any proprietary filesystem and/or device drivers. It also aims to provide a current (2.6.x) kernel with all required hardware support for the EZX phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openezx.org/ OpenEZX official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently supported phones are:
* [[Motorola]] mobile telephones, generally based on [[MontaVista]] Linux, include the [[Motorola ROKR E2| ROKR E2]], [[Motorola ROKR E6| ROKR E6]], [[Motorola A780|A780]], E680, A910, [[Motorola A1200|A1200]] and others to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openezx.org/Project_Status OpenEZX project status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827200450/http://wiki.openezx.org/Project_Status |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People's Television Network''' (abbreviated '''PTV''') is the flagship [[public broadcasting|public television network]] owned by the [[Philippine government|Philippine Government]]. Founded in 1974, PTV is the main brand of '''People's Television Network, Inc. (PTNI)''', one of the attached agencies under the [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Communications Office|Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO)]]. PTV, along with sequestered [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] and radio network [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]], forms the media arm of the PCOO. Its head office, [[studios]] and [[transmitter]] are located at Broadcast Complex, Visayas Avenue, Barangay Vasra, Diliman, [[Quezon City]].

As a government-run station, PTV receives funding from the General Appropriations Act (Annual National Budget) and sales from blocktimers, among others. PTV also run [[Muslim]]-oriented digital television channel [[Salaam TV (Philippines)|Salaam TV]].

==History==

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Gtvnetwork.JPG|150px|left|thumb|GTV Network logo in 1978.]]
The country's government television network began operations on February 2, 1974 as [[DWGT-TV|Government Television (GTV-4)]], a division of the [[National Media Production Center]]. The government channel was first headed by Lito Gorospe and later by the then-Press Secretary during the Marcos administration, [[Francisco Tatad]]. It was first headquartered in the Solana Building in [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]], and later relocated to the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|Broadcast Plaza]] in Bohol Avenue, [[Quezon City]] (now currently re-occupied by [[ABS-CBN]]).

It was renamed Maharlika Broadcasting System in 1980 under the leadership of NMPC Minister Gregorio Cendana, at the same time the network began broadcasting in full color, thus it was the last national network to transition to color broadcasting. By then, it began expanding with the opening of provincial stations nationwide, including 2 stations in Cebu and Bacolod who once owned by pre-martial law ABS-CBN.

Following the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986 on which it was taken over by pro-[[Corazon Aquino]] soldiers and supporters, it was, during that very historic event in national history, officially rebranded as People's Television (PTV) two months later in April. Broadcasters [[Tina Monzon Palma]] and Jose Mari Velez were tapped by President [[Corazon Aquino]] to handle the newly-rebranded station for a few months, before they were taken back to GMA 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/08/24/17/the-prime-of-ms-tina-monzon-palma|title=The prime of Ms. Tina Monzon Palma|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|last=Rumban|first=Luz|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later became the national network for the broadcasts of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] along with [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]].

On March 26, 1992, [[President of the Philippines|President]] Cory Aquino signed Republic Act 7306 turning PTV Network into a government corporation known formally as People's Television Network, Inc.

Shortly after he took over the mantle of government in June 1992, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed PTV Network's first board of directors. The Network was given a one-time equity funding for capital outlay. Since 1992, PTV has been operating on revenues it generates on its own. [[Republic Act]] 7306 stipulates that the government shall not appropriate funds for the operations of the Network .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

PTNI is on full satellite transmission nationwide since 1992 using PALAPA C2. Its flagship station PTV-4, which is based in [[Quezon City]], boasts of a 40-kilowatt brand-new transmitter sitting on a {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower. With its 32 provincial stations across the country, the network has extended its reach and coverage to approximately 85 percent of the television viewing public nationwide.

[[File:PTV4-LOGO-1995.png|left|thumb|Logo of PTV in 1995]]
So far, PTNI has come up with the kind of programs that have earned for itself the Hall of Fame Award for Best Station and for Most Balanced Programming in 1987 and two succeeding years thereafter, from the [[Catholic]] [[Mass Media]] Awards (CMMA). It has, to its name, several pioneering and award-winning educational, cultural and public service programs for their relevance and production excellence. In 1996, PTV won the award for Best TV Station ID ("Ang Network Para Sa Pilipino" [lit. The Network For The Filipino]) in the PMPC Star Awards for Television.

PTNI has pioneered educational and cultural programming. Some of its award-winning programs were Tele-aralan ng Kakayahan (which predated ABS-CBN's The [[Knowledge Channel (ABS-CBN)|Knowledge Channel]] by decades), Ating Alamin, [[Kidsongs|Small World (and its successor) Kidsongs]], For Art's Sake, Coast to Coast and Paco Park Presents. In the 1990s, at the core of its educational programming is the Continuing Studies via Television or CONSTEL, a program aimed at upgrading teaching skills of elementary and secondary teachers of Science and English. Institutionalized by [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)]], CONSTEL Science and English are being used in teacher training by the Regional and Divisional Leader Schools of the Department of Education, culture and Sports and in Teacher Education Institutions of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]].

PTNI has also been the official broadcaster of major international sports competitions. It has covered the [[Olympic Games]], starting with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]] in Seoul, except [[Barcelona Olympics]] in 1992 (covered by [[ABS-CBN]]), the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]] in 2008 (covered by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]]), [[2012 London Olympics|London Olympics]] in 2012 and the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio Olympics]] in 2016 (covered by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]). PTNI was the carrying station of the [[South East Asian Games]] in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2007, missing from [[2009 SEA Games|2009]], and resuming at [[2017 Southeast Asian Games|2017]]; [[Asian Games]] from 1986 to 2006 and the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] in [[2007 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2007]] and [[2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2009]]. During these coverage, PTNI has received commendations from various sports organizations. In 1996, it received a presidential citation from then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] for the successful coverage of the [[Atlanta Olympic Games]].

[[File:Nbni.png|200px|left|thumb|NBN logo from 2007-2011; the NBN [[wordmark]] is used from 2001-2011.]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
On July 16, 2001, under the new management appointed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], PTNI adopted the new image and name National Broadcasting Network (NBN) carrying a new slogan "One People. One Nation. One Vision." for a new image in line with its new programming thrusts, they continued the new name until the Aquino administration in 2010.

NBN expanded its broadcast reach with the launching of NBN World on February 19, 2003 in cooperation with the Television and Radio Broadcasting Service (TARBS). This global expansion signals new directions for NBN as it becomes accessible to the rest of the world, particularly the millions of Filipinos overseas. NBN can be seen in [[Australia]], [[North America]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]]. NBN is previously transmitting via satellite nationwide using [[Agila 2]] then moved to ABS 1 (now ABS 2) last September 2011 (Now in Telstar 18 as of present time).

Before the year 2010, NBN main studios in Quezon City and its regional stations in Baguio, Cebu and Naga will be equipped with the most modern news gathering equipment for them to compete with the major television networks. Also, a new Harris Transmitter has been installed. NBN's transmitter power shall be increased from 40&amp;nbsp;kW to 60&amp;nbsp;kW (However, few years later, in 2013, the network was downgraded its transmitting power output from 60&amp;nbsp;kW to 50&amp;nbsp;kW later then back to 40&amp;nbsp;kW or 25&amp;nbsp;kW in June 2016 to control power costs). NBN's digital channel is now available on channel 48 (now moved to channel 42) using the [[ISDB-T|Japanese digital TV standard]].

In 2011, NBN continued to enhance its digital broadcasting capabilities with equipment donated from the Japanese government.
This equipment will also allow NBN to begin broadcasting emergency alerts when necessary (similar to the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the United States, but it is more likely, due to the usage of the Japanese digital TV standard, that the system would be based on the Japanese [[J-Alert]] system).

Although the branding is officially known as the National Broadcasting Network, in August 2011, the "People's Television" brand which was retired in 2001 was reintroduced as a secondary brand until a few months later, PTNI became a primary brand, and the branding National Broadcasting Network was retired.

On July 2, 2012, PTV launched its new logo and its new slogan "Telebisyon ng Bayan (lit. People's Television)" with a [[Balangay]] station ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3yLnAn61RE|title=PTV Station ID "Telebisyon ng Bayan" 2012|publisher=bidyobandido [[YouTube]] Channel|date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PTV 4 Telebisyon ng Bayan.png|200px|right|thumb|PTV logo used from July 2, 2012 to April 2, 2017]]
In March 2013, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] signed Republic Act 10390, superseding the old Charter, in which the management will be under reorganization and the government will infuse P5 billion to PTV to revitalize the station and make it "digital competitive" in spite of [[GMA Network, Inc.|GMA Network's]] questionings of the law, fearing that it may enter competition. PTV has earned P59 million generated revenues for the first and second quarter of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/376993/government-to-infuse-p5-b-into-state-tv-network Government to infuse P5 B into state TV network &amp;#124; Inquirer News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/business/2013/03/25/923570/gma-mulls-legal-option-ptv-4-revival GMA mulls legal option on PTV 4 revival &amp;#124; Business, News, The Philippine Star &amp;#124; philstar.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

PTV has started their modernization program since 2012, including the acquisition of studio technical equipment, cameras, vehicles and high-powered transmitter for the main office in Visayas Avenue, Quezon City, together with few regional offices, included in their plans is the rehabilitation of PTV stations in Naga, Baguio, Iloilo, Cebu, Zamboanga, Cotabato, Calbayog, Tacloban, Pagadian and Dumaguete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/2131441342383/ptv-11-cebu-back-on-air| title=PIA 11 Cebu back on air| publisher=''[[Philippine Information Agency]]''| date=September 4, 2015| accessdate=September 5, 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019141752/http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/2131441342383/ptv-11-cebu-back-on-air| archivedate=October 19, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/3001446083719/ptv-powers-all-visayas-stations-mindanao-next| title=PTV powers all Visayas stations, Mindanao next| publisher=''[[Philippine Information Agency]]''| date=October 29, 2015| accessdate=November 5, 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222175848/http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/3001446083719/ptv-powers-all-visayas-stations-mindanao-next| archivedate=December 22, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being operated with little or no budget, the new PTV had still managed to cover the biggest events in the country including the 2013 National and Local Elections, 2013 Central Visayas earthquake, Typhoon Ketsana, the visits of US President Barack Obama and [[Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines|Pope Francis]], the [[APEC Philippines 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptv.ph/corporate/our-story/ Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 National and Local Elections.

It should be noted that in 2005, several [[DZRB-AM|Radio ng Bayan]] programs were also aired on then NBN with the Visayas Avenue studios used for some of them, under the ''Tinig ng Bayan'' banner. In 2014, the partnership between the two was revived with an all new morning news program, ''[[RadyoBisyon]]'', which is also simulcast on IBC-13 and heard in Radyo ng Bayan stations nationwide, broadcasting from its own studios and the RnB radio booth. Before the launch, RnB - as part of the [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] - had already, since 2012, been simulcasting News @ 1 and News @ 6 on radio on all its stations.

However, Villa turned down the offer due to her strong opposition on key national issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/578885/news/nation/veteran-journalist-charie-villa-declines-offer-to-head-ptv-4-news|title=Veteran journalist Charie Villa declines offer to head PTV-4 News|publisher=[[GMA News]]|date=August 25, 2016|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Your Companion, For The Nation), which started on the following day.

In his first [[2016 State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]], President Duterte proposed the creation of a law that will merge and integrate the People's Television Network and the [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] into a single entity, to be called the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), similar to the BBC. The proposed PBC will also launch the country's first [[Specialty channel]]s for the [[Muslim]] minority ([[Salaam TV (Philippines)|Salaam TV]]) and the Lumad peoples of the south. PBC will also put up TV broadcasting hubs in Visayas and Mindanao, aside from its main headquarters in Luzon and TV broadcast studios within its major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/140875-duterte-sona-2016-state-media|title=Duterte: State-run media to create Muslim and lumad channels|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Ranada|first=Pia|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salaam TV began test broadcasting on July 10, 2017.

==Programming==
{{main article|List of programs broadcast by People's Television Network}}
Generally, PTV airs locally-produced news and public affairs programs and documentaries, sports, public service and entertainment programs, in addition of foreign content coming from their counterparts from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]–member countries, and blocktime programs. The network serves as the main television broadcast arm of the government of the Republic of the [[Philippines]] and it is part of the Presidential Communications Operations Office.

'''Reach Out To Asia''' ''(ROTA)'' is a Qatari-based non-profit organization that provides access to primary and secondary education to children affected by crisis across Asia. It was launched in December 2005 under the patronage of Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al- Thani and chaired by Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/fr/ev.php-URL_ID=39169&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Her Highness Sheikha Mozah supports the Reach Out To Asia initiative and welcomes the Director-General of UNESCO during his state visit in Qatar - Célébrités au service de l´UNESCO - UNESCO.org|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Working under the auspices of the [[Qatar Foundation]] for Education, Science, and Community Development – a private, chartered, [[non-profit organization]], ROTA pursues its objectives through ROTAQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reachouttoasia.org/output/page20.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903044450/http://www.reachouttoasia.org/output/page20.asp |archivedate=2009-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;– which handles activities within [[Qatar]] - and ROTAsia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reachouttoasia.org/output/page161.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901173328/http://www.reachouttoasia.org/output/page161.asp |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—responsible for programs across Asia and the Middle East. In its effort to promote education, ROTA implements educational projects in countries where immediate action is needed. Ten countries have been identified as ROTA’s priorities: [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Yemen]]. Some of them are among the world’s poorest countries, while others have suffered war or natural disasters during the last years.

In June 2011, ROTA in collaboration with the [[Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE)]] began the process of translating the agency communications and training tools into Arabic. The programme, ‘INEE Arabic Language Community: Supporting Quality Education in Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recover in the Arabic-Speaking World’ was established to ensure that the communities in the Middle East have access to and benefit from INEE’s useful tools and resources.&lt;ref&gt;The Peninsula Qatar {{cite web |url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/157032-rota-and-inee-develop-educational-tool-in-arabic-.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629101525/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/157032-rota-and-inee-develop-educational-tool-in-arabic-.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sally Poncet''' (born 1954) is an Australian-born scientist and adventurer who has explored and studied the [[Antarctic]] region since 1977. Her specialty is birds and she made extensive studies of [[albatross]] and their habitats for the [[British Antarctic Survey]]. She has written guidebooks on preservation of the flora and fauna of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] and received numerous awards and honors, including the [[Blue Water Medal]], the [[Fuchs Medal]] and the [[Polar Medal]] for her contributions to understanding the southern polar region.

==Early life==
Sally Brothers{{sfn|Phillips|2007|p=73}} was born in 1954{{sfn|''The Guardian''|2015}} to a dentist{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} and grew up in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Australia.{{sfn|Brennan, B.|1990|pp=69-70}} Brothers attended [[Fahan School]], graduating in 1970{{sfn|Byfield|2012|p=30}} and then enrolled at the [[University of Tasmania]] to further her studies.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|2015}} In 1973 she met [[Jerome Poncet]], a Frenchman, who was sailing aboard the ''Damien I'' [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigating the globe]]. She completed her degree in [[botany]] and [[zoology]] and then joined Poncet in France, where they were married in 1974.  The couple made plans to sail on ''Damien II'' through the [[Southern Ocean]]{{sfn|Brennan, B.|1990|pp=69-70}} and set sail in 1976{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} aboard the 50-foot steel schooner for [[Antarctica]].{{sfn|''The Appeal-Democrat''|1989|p=31}}

==Career==
Arriving in 1977,{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}} the couple prepared to do a series of population censuses of the wildlife.{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} In 1978, they spent the winter in [[Marguerite Bay]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]],{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2016}} where Poncet began a survey of the seabirds of the area{{sfn|Brennan, B.|1990|p=70}} and a count of [[elephant seals]]. The following year, Poncet gave birth to her first son, Dion on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Island]]. Their boat had become trapped in the ice and they were forced to wait until a British [[icebreaker]] was able to release their schooner. The couple sailed back to Tasmania for repairs, where their second son, Leiv was born in 1981. The following year, they returned to the Antarctic for the 1982-1983 bird season count and settled in the [[Falkland Islands]]. Their son Lars Nigel, nicknamed Diti, was born in the Falklands in 1984.{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} Throughout the 1980s, Poncet worked in conjunction with the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) mapping locations of colonies around South Georgia and the [[Willis Islands]] of elephant seals, [[macaroni penguin]]s and [[mollymawk]]s.{{sfn|''South Georgia Newsletter''|2010}}

In 1987, couple leased a sheep farm in the Falklands{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} and continued to spend up to four summer months each year sailing and studying the wildlife in South Georgia.{{sfn|''The Appeal-Democrat''|1989|p=31}} Poncet spent a decade surveying the birdlife of the region for the BAS.{{sfn|Gosselin|1988|p=73}} In 1989, the couple were featured in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''{{sfn|''The Appeal-Democrat''|1989|p=31}} (March, 1989) and in 1990, ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' presented a documentary "Antarctic Adventure", recounting the Poncet's journey to Antarctica and their explorations of the southern polar region.{{sfn|Brennan, P.|1990}} Throughout the 1990s, Poncet continued her collaboration with the BAS, performing vegetation baseline studies.{{sfn|''South Georgia Newsletter''|2010}} [[Damien Bay]] was named after she and Jerome's boat, which had been chartered by the BAS for research.{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1998}}

In 2001, concern about damage by tourists to the [[Cape Royds]] and [[Cape Evans]] areas in which [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] had established expedition bases caused the Government of South Georgia &amp; the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) to hire Poncet to prepare an environmental assessment of the region{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2001}} to establish an [[Baseline (configuration management)|environmental baseline]].{{sfn|Antarctic Research Trust|2016}} In 2002, Poncet began trials on a rat eradication project in an effort to restore the South Georgia [[pipit]] population.{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}} The [[brown rat]] population, originally arriving on the island aboard ships in the 19th century, had caused extreme losses in the [[petrel]], pipit and [[Prion (bird)|prion]] bird colonies.{{sfn|Neil|2016|p=114}} It was the first such trial in South Georgia{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}}  and a similar project on the Falklands led Poncet in 2011 to the discovery of a new breeding ground of [[southern giant petrel]] in the [[Choiseul Sound]].{{sfn|Cooper|2011}} By 2013, the South Georgia project had cleared the area of rodents,{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}} when Poncet reported the first pipit nest in [[Schlieper Bay]] of the eradication target area. The nest was found near [[Weddell Point]] during one of Poncet's expeditions tracking albatross. Since her report, numerous other nest sightings have occurred.{{sfn|Neil|2016|p=114}}

Poncet co-authored with [[Kim Crosbie]] two editions of the ''South Georgia Visitor’s Guide''. She has also worked with the GSGSSI as an advisor on reindeer eradication,{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}} using humane methods to relocate the invasive species which has caused damage to vegetation.{{sfn|''South Georgia Newsletter''|2014}} In 2005, Poncet led the Petrel and Prion Survey team in work on a census of the [[wandering albatross]]. The count was triggered by concerns over the catastrophic death of the birds because of [[longline fishing]].{{sfn|Burnett-Stanley|2005}} Between 2005 and 2007, Poncet led a similar count of the [[giant petrel]] and [[white-chinned petrel]] colonies.{{sfn|Antarctic Research Trust|2016}} As the GSGSSI is committed to performing a survey on the wandering albatross every ten years, Poncet partnered with Cheesemans’ Ecology Safaris in a public-private partnership in 2015 to offset costs of the census. Poncet led the scientific research conducted during the expedition.{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2014}}

==Awards and honors==
In 1992, Poncet and her husband were awarded the [[Blue Water Medal]] for their years of cruising in the Antarctic and publication of a guidebook focused on preservation of the region.{{sfn|Cruising Club of America|1992}} In 1995, she received the Gerdy Jevtic alumni medal from Fahan School.{{sfn|Byfield|2012|p=30}} Poncet was awarded the [[Fuchs Medal]] from the British Antarctic Survey in 2010 for her wildlife and vegetation mapping and conservation management strategies of the southern polar region.{{sfn|''South Georgia Newsletter''|2010}} In 2015, she was awarded the [[Polar Medal]] for her research and efforts at protecting the biodiversity of South Georgia and the Antarctic.{{sfn|''MercoPress''|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">'''Serb People's Party''' (better known as '''Serb People's Party in/on Primorje''', {{lang-sr|Српска народна странка у/на Приморју}} / ''Srpska narodna stranka u/na Primorju'', "Serb People's Party in/on the Littoral") was political party in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] during  the time of [[Austria-Hungary]].

Following the [[Dalmatian parliamentary election, 1876]], the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Dalmatia)|People's Party]] was in power. In 1878, led by [[Sava Bjelanović]], the Serb members of the party left and founded the Serb Party.  The Serb Party retained the leading position in the provinces of upper Dalmatia (Dalmatian hinterland): [[Kninska Krajina]], [[Bukovica]], [[Ravni Kotari]], as well as the [[Bay of Kotor]] (which is today in [[Montenegro]]).

A significant member of the Serb Party was [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubiša]]. In his political efforts, he fought against the ethnic Italian domination in Dalmatian politics and culture, for the equality of religions and languages, for the emancipation of Serb populace in Dalmatia, the economic benefit of the province but also for the autonomy of Dalmatia and against the unification with [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]]. Stjepan Mitrov Ljubiša had been the President of the [[Dalmatian parliament]] between 1870 and 1878 when he was overthrown by the clerical Croat fraction in the People's Party led by [[Mihovil Pavlinović]].

The party issued the [[Srpski List]] (1880-1904).

The '''Seychelles Coast Guard''' (SCG) is a branch of the [[Seychelles People's Defence Force]] created in 1992. It is a maritime, military, multi-mission service. They recently acquired responsibility for search and rescue for vessel incidents as well as environmental protection from the Port and Marine Services Division.

Although the [[Seychelles]] are a small country, it is located off the [[Horn of Africa]], strategically close to the operation of notorious pirates.&lt;ref name=Sna2014-11-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seychelles2014-10-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mfa2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheNationalUAE2013-03-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=WorkboatWorld2011-01-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheNationalUAE2013-03-11/&gt;  [[India]], [[China]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] have made strategic donations of patrol vessels to the Seychelles.  Through the Seychelles Coast Guard's employment of her small fleet, Seychelles has been able to arrest, try and convict many pirates.  In 2013 the UAE paper [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|''The National'']] reported that Seychelles was then imprisoning more than 100 convicted pirates.

As of 2016, the Coast Guard has several operational vessels. The largest and most capable vessels were all donated.

In May 2011, the SCG helped to protect the privacy of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]] during their [[honeymoon]] on the [[North Island, Seychelles|North Island]]. At the end of their stay, the couple invited several members of the Coast Guard ashore to personally thank them for their efforts.&lt;ref name=Bbc2011-05-21/&gt;

'''Sputnik''' or '''MDR Sputnik''' is a youth-oriented [[Germany|German]] [[radio station]], and is part of [[Leipzig]]-based [[public broadcaster]] [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] with its seat in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. The station, which plays primarily the typical variety of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] music, is the successor to the [[East Germany|East German]] youth station '''DT64''', founded in 1964. It was given its present name on May 1, 1993, following [[German reunification]] in 1990; the new name, inspired by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]] [[satellite]], was the suggestion of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[prime minister]] [[Kurt Biedenkopf]].

While DT64 was broadcast throughout East Germany, Sputnik is available on [[FM radio|FM]] only in one of the five federal states which replaced the [[East Germany|GDR]] and thus only in one of the three federal states that belong to [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] coverage area ([[Saxony Anhalt|Saxony-Anhalt]]); it is available throughout [[Europe]] via the [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellite on 19.2° east in [[DVB-S]] standard as well as in most [[Germany|German]] [[Cable television|cable networks]] on [[DVB-C]] and in the MDR area ([[Saxony]], [[Saxony Anhalt|Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]]) via [[FM radio|FM]] in most of the [[Cable television|cable networks]] and via [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB+]].

DT64 lost all FM frequencies in the first half of 1992. In four new federal states these frequencies were given to private radio stations, in [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] a new public youth radio station ('''Rock Radio B''', later '''Fritz''') started on the frequencies DT64 used until this time. DT64 had to switch to AM in summer 1992, AM transmission lasted for one year. During this time the station got its new name, MDR Sputnik. Between 1993 and 1997 '''MDR Sputnik''' was available only via [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellite analog audio subcarriers and a special German digital Radio System DSR, receivable via Cable and satellite. In 1997 the [[FM radio|FM]] coverage in [[Saxony Anhalt|Saxony-Anhalt]] was built up. During this time the program lost most of the journalistic content, most of the word content disappeared. At the end of this process there was nothing that could remind one of DT64.

After a relaunch as high quality youth program under the new station manager Eric Markuse in December 2006 English news was broadcast the whole afternoon, between 1.30 P.M. and 6.30 P.M. and Sputnik got back a great variety of journalistic content as well as a well diversified music program with a significant amount of independent music.

In summer 2010 the [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] cut the budget again, English news and most of the journalistic content ceased, the station manager Eric Markuse left MDR Sputnik. Today (2014) Sputnik is a standard music program again.

Sputnik also operates an [[internet radio]] station, '''Sputnik.de''', which has channels for [[Electronic Music]], melancholic music, [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[dance music|dance]], rock music, and a stream broadcasting the alternative evening programme ''Popkult'' the whole day.

'''Sun Direct''' is an Indian [[direct broadcast satellite]] service provider. Its satellite service, launched in 2007, transmits digital satellite television and audio to households in India. Sun Direct uses [[MPEG-4]] digital compression, transmitting HD Channels on [[GSAT-15]] Sun Direct at 93.5[[Celestial coordinate system|°E]]. and SD Channels on [[MEASAT-3]] at 91.5°E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lyngsat.com/providers/in/Sun-Direct.html|title=Sun Direct - LyngSat|website=www.lyngsat.com|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sun Direct is a joint venture between the Maran's [[Sun Network]] family and the Astro Group of [[Malaysia]]. Sun TV entered into an MoU with the Astro group on 27 January 1997, when Aircel was not in existence, but since the government of India did not allow the use of KU band transponders for DTH services the project was put on hold, the firm said in a statement. After the DTH policy was announced by the government in December 2007, Astro picked up a 20% stake in Sun Direct TV, the stake was valued at approximately $115 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-02-16/news/28551941_1_astro-sun-direct-tv-dth-services Sun, Astro deny media reports of impropriety in deal]. The Economic Times. 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Direct TV was registered on 16 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/PIL-plea-against-Sun-DTH-services/article14844366.ece PIL plea against Sun DTH services]. Hindu.com. Retrieved on 17 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the failed launch of Sun Direct [[Insat#INSAT-4C|INSAT 4C]] resulted in Sun Direct lack of transponders, delaying the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/feb/21cas.htm Lack of transponders hits DTH expansioN]. Rediff.com. Retrieved on 17 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The service was finally launched on 18 Jan 2008 after availability of transponders from [[Insat#INSAT-4B|INSAT 4B]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blonnet.com/2007/09/22/stories/2007092251250500.htm Sun TV group’s special offer for DTH] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021085848/http://www.blonnet.com/2007/09/22/stories/2007092251250500.htm |date=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Direct offered subscribers a [[satellite dish]] and [[Set-top box]] for free and basic monthly plan as low as [[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|7px]]75 (approximately). Currently basic monthly plan costs [[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|7px|Sun Directx]]159.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Sun Direct spread rapidly all over the country owing to lowest pricing of any DTH services in India. In December 2009, Sun Direct was launched in [[Mumbai]], country's financial capital and announced its pan India launch. By 2009 it became the leading DTH provider with 3 million subscribers.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/09/stories/2009040956431500.htm Business : Sun Direct launches HD services]. The Hindu (9 April 2009). Retrieved on 17 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the second largest DTH service provider of India. In April 2010 Sun Direct became the No.1 DTH service provider of India with 5.8 million subscribers and soon launched its HD service in India.

As of January 2015, Sun Direct crossed the 10 million subscriber mark.

The partial service was restored on [[Insat#INSAT-4B|INSAT 4B]] Sun Direct with 193 channels and meantime SUN Direct is now transmitting 173 channels on [[MEASAT-3]] for uninterrupted transition of Sun Direct customers from [[Insat#INSAT-4B|INSAT 4B]] at 93.5[[Celestial coordinate system|°E]].&lt;ref name="lyngsat.com"&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/in4b.html Insat 4B at 93.5°E].

'''Vehicle registration plates of [[Liechtenstein]]''' are composed of two letters and up to five numbers, and in between the letters and  numbers is the coat of arms of the city. The plates have white characters on a retro-reflective black background and use the same type of font as [[Swiss car number plates]]. Short-period temporary registered plates have yellow coloured font while long-periods have year bands on the right. Duty unpaid vehicles are similar to civilian vehicles but ends with ''U'' prefix.

== Car designations ==
Due to the country being small in size, only around two thousand cars are registered each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medienportal.li/en/news-detail/article/2015-sees-sharp-increase-in-new-car-registrations/&lt;/ref&gt; The plates only have one type of code:
*FL - [[Fürstentum Liechtenstein]], meaning the Principality of Liechtenstein.

Plates also contain a small version of the [[coat of arms of Liechtenstein]] between the FL code and the number.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/country-and-people/state-symbols/flag-and-coat-of-arms/ "This small coat of arms is used, among other ...car registration plates."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">The '''''World report on disability''''' ('''WRD''') is the first document to give an extensive global picture of the situation of people with disabilities, their needs, and the barriers they face to participating fully in their societies.  The aim of the report is to support the implementation of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD). Published in 2011 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Bank]], the report assembles scientific information on disability, with relevance to the fields of [[public health]], human rights and development. The intended audience is policy-makers, service providers, professionals, and advocates for people with disabilities and their families. The WRD was developed with participation of people with disabilities and their organizations, as well as other relevant stakeholders.&lt;ref name=WRD&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/en/  "World report on disability"], Geneva, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key findings==
*More than 1 billion persons in the world have some form of disability. This corresponds to about 15% of the world's population. Between 110-190 million people have very significant difficulties in functioning.
*People with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed than non-disabled people. In [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries, the employment rate of people with disabilities (44%) is slightly over half that for people without disabilities (75%).
*People with disabilities often do not receive needed [[health care]]. Half of disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of non-disabled people.  People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to find health-care providers' skills inadequate; nearly three times more likely to be denied health care; and four times more likely to report being treated badly than non-disabled people.
*Children with disabilities are less likely to attend school than non-disabled children. Education completion gaps are found across all age groups in all settings, with the pattern more pronounced in poorer countries. Even in countries where most non-disabled children go to school, many children with disabilities do not go to school. For example in Bolivia about 98% of non-disabled children go to school, but under 40% of disabled children attend school. In Indonesia, over 80% of non-disabled children go to school, but less than 25% of children with disabilities go to school.
*People with disabilities experience increased dependency and restricted participation in their societies. Even in high-income countries, 20-40% of people with disabilities lack the help they require to engage in [[activities of daily living|everyday activities]]. In the United States of America, 70% of adults with disabilities rely on family and friends for assistance with daily activities.&lt;ref name=WRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/index.html ''Disability and Health'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main messages==
*Disability prevalence is high and growing, due to aging populations and the increase in chronic conditions. Other factors like road traffic crashes, violence and disasters contribute to the growing numbers in certain contexts.
*Disability disproportionately affects vulnerable populations (women, older people and those who are poor).
*Disability is very diverse, despite the stereotypical view of a disabled person as a [[wheelchair]] user.
*People with disabilities face barriers in accessing services (health, education, employment, and transport, among others).
*Many of the barriers people with disabilities face are avoidable, and the disadvantages associated with disability can be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/factsheet.pdf World report on disability: fact sheet], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
As well as a series of specific recommendations, the WRD highlighted nine cross-cutting recommendations, as follows:&lt;ref name=WRD/&gt;
#Enable access to all mainstream systems and services
#Invest in programmes and services for people with disabilities
#Adopt a national disability strategy and a plan of action
#Involve people with disabilities
#Improve human resource capacity
#Provide adequate funding and improve affordability
#Increase public awareness and understanding about disability
#Improve the availability and quality of data on disability
#Strengthen and support research on disability.

==Press coverage==
The launch of the ''World report on disability'', on 9 June 2011 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, received widespread media coverage. Global and national media outlets such as ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian.[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jun/09/world-disability-report-development-issue "Disability must be seen as a development issue, says report"] 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/report-15-percent-of-world-population-is-disabled/2011/06/09/AGZcqBNH_story.html "Report: 15 percent of world population is disabled"] 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Globe and Mail'',&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/health-news/more-than-1-billion-people-live-with-a-disability-who-says/article2054185/ "More than 1 billion people live with a disability, WHO says"] 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sydney Morning Herald'',&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald. [http://www.smh.com.au/world/disabled-worlds-largest-minority-20110610-1fx19.html "Disabled 'world's largest minority'"] 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', ''La Nacion'', ''The Hindu'', ''Gazeta'', ''El Pais'' and many others covered the launch.  Broadcasters such as CNN, BBC Radio, Al Jazeera English, Fox News and Voice of America also ran stories on the report, as did many news agencies:  Associated Press, Agence France-Press, Deutsche Presse Agentur, The Canadian Press and Panapress.

==Follow-up==
The global launch has been followed up with national launches in many countries including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ireland, Finland, Germany, Ghana, Netherlands, Myanmar, The Philippines, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, USA as well as in the European Parliament. The goal of national launches and [[health policy|policy]] dialogues is to help countries to use the WRD as a tool to strengthen their domestic policy and provision and/or international development work. Many countries now have national plans of action on disability, in line with the report’s recommendation and/or are working to implement the CRPD, with the aid of the report.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://who.int/disabilities/media/news/wrd_2012/en/index.html "Update on national launches of the World report on disability"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementing the recommendations of the WRD will require a strong commitment from a broad range of stakeholders. While national governments are expected to take on the most significant role, other actors can make important contributions. The report makes concrete recommendations on how United Nations agencies, Disabled People’s Organizations, service providers, academic institutions, the private sector, communities and people with disabilities and their families can help translate the report into action. WHO is developing supporting materials, such as a model disability survey, guidelines on rehabilitation, and training on [[community-based rehabilitation]] to further assist disability work in countries.
