'''1 Rockefeller Plaza''' (formerly the '''Time &amp; Life Building''' and the '''General Dynamics Building''') is a 36-story building located on the east side of [[Rockefeller Plaza]] between 48th and 49th Streets in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Completed in 1937, the tower is part of [[Rockefeller Center]], which was built in the [[Art Deco]] style. 

==History==
Rockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=J. | title=Gotham Rising: New York in the 1930s | publisher=I. B. Tauris, Limited | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-78453-529-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxG3DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR18 | access-date=2017-11-23 | page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=93}} The site of 1 Rockefeller Plaza, located on the southern block, was being used as a [[parking lot]],{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=338}} and at the time, it was the city's largest parking facility.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=219}}

In 1936, [[Time Inc.]] expressed interest in moving out of their [[Chrysler Building]] offices into a larger headquarters, having just launched their ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Time-Moving-1938"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/05/02/98130355.pdf|title=BUSINESS MOVING MARKED BY SPEED|date=May 2, 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 7, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller Center's managers persuaded Time to move to a proposed skyscraper on part of the southern empty lot, located on Rockefeller Plaza between 48th and 49th Streets, by promising the company seven floors and a penthouse; space to expand; a 20-year lease; and the right to name the building after themselves.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=93}} Excavation for a new building at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, numbered 9 Rockefeller Plaza at the time, started in June 1936. The original plans stipulated a 32-story building, but the height was increased to 36 stories with the use of setbacks on the 48th Street elevation.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=197}} The number of setbacks was minimized, which increased rentable space within the building, and the original blueprints for the plot were retained for the Time &amp; Life Building.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=54}} The steelwork for that building was laid on September 25, 1936, and was complete by November 28, forty-three working days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/11/28/93534140.pdf|title=STEEL WORK FINISHED ON ROCKEFELLER UNIT; Frame for 36-Story Building Is Completed in 43 Days, a Record for Speed.|date=November 28, 1936|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Time &amp; Life Building, as it was known,{{efn|The "Time-Life Building" appellation would later apply to [[1271 Avenue of the Americas]], also located in Rockefeller Center,{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=112}} which opened in 1959.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Time-1959&gt;{{cite web | title=TIME'S TENANTS BEGIN MOVING IN; Finishing Touches Are Put on 48-Story Structure, Rising 587 Feet | website=The New York Times | date=1959-12-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/22/archives/times-tenants-begin-moving-in-finishing-touches-are-put-on-48story.html | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the original Time &amp; Life Building became known as 1 Rockefeller Plaza.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=112}}}} opened on April 1, 1937,{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=93}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-TimeLife-Opening-1937"&gt;{{cite news | title=ROCKEFELLER UNIT READY FOR OPENING | work=The New York Times | date=1937-03-31 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/03/31/94347746.pdf | access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the final block of Rockefeller Plaza abutting the building, between 48th and 49th Streets.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-TimeLife-Opening-1937"/&gt; ''Time'' moved into the building in 1938.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Time-Moving-1938" /&gt; Time Inc's lease stipulated that nothing else could be constructed within {{convert|200|ft|m}} of the Time &amp; Life Building's uppermost floors.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=398}}

The original tenants included the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] and [[Museum of Modern Art]],{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=197}} but Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Time-Moving-1938"/&gt; In 1960, the building was renamed for [[General Dynamics]] after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/01/12/105174509.pdf|title=RADIO CITY LEASE TAKES IN 6 FLOORS; General Dynamics Is Lessee and Gives Name to Old Time-Life Building|date=1960-01-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to [[St. Louis]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/11/archives/general-dynamics-moving-headquarters-out-of-city.html|title=General Dynamics Moving Headquarters Out of City|last=Shipler|first=David K.|date=1971-02-11|website=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th Streets,{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=197}} is the original [[Time–Life]] Building.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=93}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite aia5|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower contains a 10th-floor setback on the 48th Street side,{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=197}} while its 49th Street side is actually set back from the street, rising as a slab. The Rockefeller Plaza side is almost a slab except for the 10th-story setback, and the eastern side connects to 600 Fifth Avenue via a seven-story annex.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=202}} Its north-south axis aligns with the since-modified alignment of the International Building.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=197}} One Rockefeller's artwork was designed for a generic tenant, with a general life theme.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=198}}

==Artwork==
The artwork included Lawrie's bas-relief of [[Pegasus]], robed figure, and eagle above the entrance, signifying human progress.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=198}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=137}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Sculptures-Shown-1937"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/09/09/94422868.pdf|title=THREE SCULPTURES SHOWN; Groups Cut in Building's Stone at Rockefeller Plaza|date=1937-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Attilio Piccirilli]]'s "Joy of Life" limestone relief, depicts a hedonistic [[Dionysus]] enjoying wine.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=199}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=138}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Sculptures-Shown-1937" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lombardo 1944"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKQ5AAAAMAAJ|title=Attilio Piccirilli: life of an American sculptor|last=Lombardo|first=J.V.|publisher=Pitman Publishing Corporation|year=1944|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261–262}} The entrance portal is decorated with [[C.

It is called "Människan och Naturen” or "Man and Nature" and was created from 1938 to 1941. The right-hand carving depicts a wooden faun pushing nature away, while the left-side carving consists of a wooden nymph in the foliage, and the central carving depicts a wooden man on horseback listening to a metal [[Mexican nightingale]] that every hour on the opens its beak and sings a recording of a Mexican Nightingale from the Bronx Zoo.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=134}}

'''Ahmed Abdel Hadi Chalabi'''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes transcribed as ''Ahmad al-Jalabi''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|أحمد عبد الهادي الجلبي}}; 30 October 1944&amp;nbsp;– 3 November 2015) was an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] politician, a founder of the [[Iraqi National Congress]] (INC) and the [[Prime Minister of Iraq|President]] of the [[Iraqi Governing Council|Governing Council of Iraq]] ([[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|37th]] [[Prime Minister of Iraq]])

He was interim Minister of Oil in [[Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/30/AR2005123001307.html|title=Chalabi Named Iraq Oil Minister|work=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April–May 2005 and December 2005 – January 2006 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 2005 to May 2006. Chalabi failed to win a seat in parliament in the December 2005 elections, and when the new Iraqi cabinet was announced in May 2006, he was not given a post. Once dubbed the "[[George Washington]] of Iraq"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Republic]]'', "Are Foreign Rebel Leaders Duping The American Right, Again?", 11 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; by American supporters, he later fell out of favor and came under investigation by several U.S. government sources.

In the lead-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the Iraqi National Congress (INC), with the assistance of lobbying powerhouse [[BKSH &amp; Associates]],&lt;ref name="roston"&gt;Adam Roston, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080421/roston Chalabi's Lobby] ''The Nation'' 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; provided a major portion of the information on which [[Office of Special Plans|U.S. Intelligence]] based its condemnation of the Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]], including reports of [[weapons of mass destruction]] and alleged ties to [[al-Qaeda]]. Most, if not all, of this information has turned out to be false and Chalabi has been called a [[fabricator (intelligence)|fabricator]].&lt;ref name="prairieweather.typepad.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prairieweather.typepad.com/the_scribe/2006/09/9706_npr_michae.html|title=The Scribe|work=typepad.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent20151103&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ahmed-chalabi-politician-who-furnished-bush-and-blair-with-the-false-information-that-led-to-the-a6720136.html |title=Ahmed Chalabi: Politician who furnished Bush and Blair with the false information that led to the allied invasion of Iraq |last1=Salaheddin |first1=Sinan |date=3 November 2015 |website=www.independent.co.uk |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, Chalabi also subsequently boasted, in an interview with the British ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', about the impact that their alleged falsifications had on American policy,&lt;ref name=Telegraph20040219&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1454831/Chalabi-stands-by-faulty-intelligence-that-toppled-Saddams-regime.html |title=Chalabi stands by faulty intelligence that toppled Saddam's regime |last1=Fairweather |first1=Jack |last2=La Guardia |first2=Anton |date=19 February 2004 |website=www.telegraph.co.uk |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; — these factors led to a falling out between him and the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=Independent20151103 /&gt; Furthermore, Chalabi was found guilty in the [[Petra Bank]] scandal in [[Jordan]].

In January 2012, a French intelligence official stated that he believed Chalabi to be "acting on behalf of Iran".&lt;ref name=NYT20120125&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/world/middleeast/26iht-m26-bahrain-conflict.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all |title=In Bahrain, Worries Grow of Violent Shiite-Sunni Confrontation |last1=Mekhennet |first1=Souad |date=25 January 2012 |website=www.nytimes.com |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Chalabi was the son of a prominent [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] family,&lt;ref name="aljazeera-obit" /&gt; one of the wealthy power elite of [[Baghdad]].  He was born at [[Kadhimiya]] in 1944.  His family, who dated back 300 years to the Sultanate ran Iraq’s oldest commercial bank under the British-backed [[Kingdom of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi"&gt;{{cite news|title=The unexpected end of the man who helped deceive America into war in Iraq|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677550-unexpected-end-man-who-helped-deceive-america-war-iraq-ahmed|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a wealthy grain merchant and member of the Iraqi parliament, became head of the senate when King Abdullah was assassinated.

His family retired from public life to a farmhouse near Baghdad when the military seized power.  Chalabi left Iraq with his family in 1958, following the [[14 July Revolution]],&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "legacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34713891 |first=Jim |last=Muir |title=Ahmed Chalabi death highlights Iraq war legacy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent most of his life in the United States and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = "profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2291649.stm |title=Profile: Ahmed Chalabi |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Baghdad College]] and [[Seaford College]] in Sussex, England before leaving for America.

=== Western education ===
In exile, following the Ba'ath party takeover, his family acted as the Iraqi Shia clergy’s bankers.&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt;  In the mid-1960s, he studied with [[cryptography|cryptographer]] [[Whitfield Diffie]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from which he received a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landau, ''Privacy on the Line: The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption'', MIT Press, 1998, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Chicago]] under the direction of [[George Glauberman]] on the Theory of Knots.&lt;ref&gt;Dissertation title: ''On the [[Jacobson radical|Jacobson Radical]] of a [[Group algebra|Group Algebra]]'', see {{MathGenealogy|6597}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he took a position in the mathematics department at the [[American University of Beirut]]. He published three mathematics papers between 1973 and 1980, in the field of [[abstract algebra]].

In 1971, Chalabi married Leila Osseiran, daughter of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] politician [[Adil Osseiran]]. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Where Plan A"&gt;Dexter Filkins. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/03/africa/web.1103chalabi.php "Where Plan A left Ahmad Chalabi"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 3 November 2006.  Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst still at Beirut the civil war broke out in 1975, so he moved to Jordan and found work as an interpreter.

== Business career ==
Chalabi was a bold and shrewd investor, amassing a fortune of $100 million.  During his life he was accused of corruption many times.  In 1977, he founded the [[Petra Bank]] in [[Jordan]] with Crown Prince Hassan, the King's brother.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; In May 1989, the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Jordan]], [[Mohammed Said Nabulsi]], issued a decree ordering all banks in the country to deposit 35% of their reserves with the Central Bank.&lt;ref name="Roston2009"&gt;{{cite book|author =Aram Roston|title=The Man Who Pushed America to War: The Extraordinary Life, Adventures, and Obessions of Ahmad Chalabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRX1xXm04iEC&amp;pg=PT52|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Nation Books|isbn=978-0-7867-4429-9|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petra Bank was the only bank that was unable to meet this requirement.  An investigation was launched which led to accusations of embezzlement and false accounting.  The bank failed, causing a $350 million bail-out by the Central Bank.&lt;ref name = "chequered"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy |last=Scott-Joynt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2953109.stm |title=Chalabi's chequered finances |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=17 April 2003 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalabi fled the country, in the boot of a Jordanian prince's car,&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt; before the authorities could react. Chalabi was convicted and sentenced ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for [[bank fraud]] by a Jordanian [[military tribunal]] to 22 years in prison.  Chalabi maintained that his prosecution was a politically motivated effort to discredit him sponsored by [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt;

=== Exile in the UK ===
Living abroad by 1992 in London, and unable to return home for fear of his life, he set up the Iraqi National Congress with an agenda of regime change for his homeland.  The organization was open to all ethnic Iraqis - Kurds and Arabs - as well as Sunnis and Shias.  Already a fluent English speaker, he turned his attention to Washington DC.

In 1995 after preparation and lobbying he persuaded President Clinton to fund an expedition into northern Iraq to use subterfuge to start an insurgency.  Chalabi was convinced that the Iraqi military would rise up to overthrow the dictator.  The commanders to whom he had spoken, were the same who openly supported Saddam and crushed his opponents in the Kurdish and Shi'ite revolts.  The insurgency failed, lacking the promised ground troops, and 100 insurgents were killed by the military.  The command structure of INC fell apart with factional infighting.  Chalabi was banned from those frequent visits to CIA HQ at Langley, Virginia.  Nonetheless Chalabi was doggedly determined: in 1998 Congress passed the Iraqi Liberation Act making it American law that "regime change" would happen in Iraq.

It was reported by BBC News in May 2005 that the Jordanian government was considering whether to [[pardon]] Chalabi, in part to ease the relations between Jordan and the new Iraqi government of which Chalabi was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4551345.stm |title=Jordan considers clearing Chalabi |first=Jon |last=Leyne |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, Chalabi proposed a $32 million compensation fund for depositers affected by Petra Bank's failure. The website for Petra Bank contains a press release stating that Chalabi would refuse the pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrabank.com/pre/table.php?news |title=Response to press reports about the resolution of Petra bank case |accessdate=2007-08-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105133312/http://www.petrabank.com/pre/table.php?news |archivedate=5 January 2007 |df=dmy }}.

Chalabi headed the executive council of the INC, an umbrella Iraqi opposition group created in 1992 for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name = "legacy"/&gt; The INC received major funding and assistance from the United States.&lt;ref name = "chequered"/&gt; Chalabi was involved in organizing a resistance movement among [[Kurd]]s in northern Iraq in the early mid-1990s.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "chequered"/&gt; When that effort was crushed and hundreds of his supporters were killed, Chalabi fled the country.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; Chalabi lobbied in Washington for the passage of the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] (passed October 1998).  This [[earmark (politics)|earmark]]ed [[United States dollar|US$]]97 million to support Iraqi opposition groups.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; But in 2001 it was revealed that INC was accused of false accounting and irregularities.  During the period from March 2000 to September 2003, the U.S. State Department paid nearly $33 million to the INC, according to a [[General Accounting Office]] report released in 2004,some of which was used to purchase office artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040724075535/http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?gao-04-559 "State Department: Issues Affecting Funding of Iraqi National Congress Support Foundation"].

Before the [[Iraq War]] (2003), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some members of the U.S. government, including some prominent [[neoconservatives]] within [[the Pentagon]]. Chalabi was said to have had political contacts within the [[Project for the New American Century]], most notably with [[Paul Wolfowitz]], a student of nuclear strategist [[Albert Wohlstetter]], and [[Richard Perle]]. He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and political [[Pundit (politics)|pundit]]s in the United States, most notably [[Jim Hoagland]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who held him up as a notable force for [[democracy]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/22/iraq.chalabi/index.html "Iraqi minister: Chalabi will be arrested: One-time U.S. confidant to face bank fraud charges in Jordan."] [[CNN]]. 22 January 2005.

The [[CIA]] was largely skeptical of Chalabi and the INC, but information allegedly from his group (most famously from a defector codenamed "Curveball") made its way into intelligence dossiers used by President [[George W. Bush]] and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to justify an invasion of Iraq. "Curveball", [[Curveball (informant)|Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi]], fed officials hundreds of pages of bogus "firsthand" descriptions of [[mobile weapons laboratory|mobile biological weapons factories]] on wheels and rails.&lt;ref name = "curve"/&gt; [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] later used this information in a [[U.N.]] presentation trying to garner support for the war, despite warnings from [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|German intelligence]] that "Curveball" was fabricating claims.&lt;ref name = "curve"/&gt; Since then, the CIA has admitted that the defector made up the story, and Powell said in 2011 the information should not have been used in his presentation.&lt;ref name = "curve"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/16/colin-powell-cia-curveball |title=Colin Powell demands answers over Curveball's WMD lies |first1=Ed |last1=Pilkington |first2=Helen |last2=Pidd |first3=Martin |last3=Chulov |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later congressionally appointed investigation (Robb-Silberman) concluded that Curveball had no relation whatsoever to the INC, and that press reports linking Curveball to the INC were erroneous.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|date=1 April 2005 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |title=Intelligence Analysts Whiffed on a 'Curveball' |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=24 July 2007 |author1=Miller, Greg |author2=Drogin, Bob |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803124926/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |archivedate=3 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INC often worked with the media, most notably with [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], concerning her [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] stories for ''[[The New York Times]]'' starting on 26 February 1998.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Broad and Judith Miller.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 February 1998.  Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, given the lack of discovery of WMDs, most of the WMD claims of the INC were shown to have been either misleading, exaggerated, or completely made up while INC information about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein's loyalists and Chalabi's personal enemies were accurate.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Another of Chalabi's advocates was [[American Enterprise Institute]]'s Iraq specialist [[Danielle Pletka]].  Chalabi received advice on media and television presentation techniques from the [[Ireland|Irish]] scriptwriter and commentator [[Eoghan Harris]] prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atholbooks.org/review/iraq.php "Iraq: Reduced To A State Of Nature In The Name Of Progress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012122946/http://www.atholbooks.org/review/iraq.php |date=12 October 2007 }}. Editorial. ''Irish Political Review''. December 2006. Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Additional citation needed.|date=November 2014}}

In April as U.S. forces took control during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]], Chalabi entered with allied troops the southern town of Shatrah.  300 US-trained FIF (Freedom for Iraq Fighters) expected opposition, but none emerged.   Thousands of Iraqis cheered the troops.  Chalabi returned under their aegis and was given a position on the [[Iraq interim governing council]] by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]].  He served as president of the council in September 2003. He denounced a plan to let the UN choose an interim government for Iraq. "We are grateful to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] for liberating Iraq, but it is time for the [[Iraqi people]] to run their affairs," he was quoted as saying in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last= Sanger|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFD7113FF932A15756C0A9629C8B63|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE EXILE; A Seat of Honor Lost to Open Political Warfare|date= 21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, Chalabi was the only candidate whose unfavorable ratings exceeded his favorable ones with Iraqis in a State Department poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Larry|last= Diamond|title=Squandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq|place=New York|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt &amp; Co.|date=2005|ref=p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of nearly 3,000 Iraqis in February 2004 (by [[Oxford Research International]], sponsored by the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the U.S., [[ARD (TV)|ARD]] of [[Germany]], and the [[NHK]] in [[Japan]]), only 0.2 percent of respondents said he was the most trustworthy leader in Iraq (see survey link below, question #13).  A secret document written in 2002 by the British Overseas and Defence Secretariat reportedly described Chalabi as "a convicted fraudster popular on [[Capitol Hill]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1472540/Ministers-were-told-premier-was-seen-as-stooge.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Ministers were told premier was seen as stooge|first=Michael|last=Smith|date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the WMD controversy, Chalabi told London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in February 2004, &lt;blockquote&gt;We are heroes in error.  As far as we're concerned, we've been entirely successful.  That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad.  What was said before is not important.  The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] is looking for a scapegoat.&lt;ref name=Telegraph20040219 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Falling out with the U.S., 2004–05==
As Chalabi's position of trust with the Pentagon crumbled, he found a new political position as a champion of Iraq's [[Shi'ite]]s (Chalabi himself was a Shi'ite). Beginning 25 January 2004, Chalabi and his close associates promoted the claim that leaders around the world were illegally profiting from the [[Oil for Food program]]. These charges were around the same time that UN envoy [[Lakhdar Brahimi]] indicated that Chalabi would likely not be welcome in a future Iraqi government. Up until this time, Chalabi had been mentioned formally several times in connection with possible future leadership positions. Chalabi contended that documents in his possession detailed the misconduct, but he did not provide any documents or other evidence. The U.S. sharply criticized Chalabi's Oil for Food investigation as undermining the credibility of its own.

Additionally, Chalabi and other members of the INC were investigated for fraud involving the exchange of Iraqi currency, grand theft of both national and private assets, and many other criminal charges in Iraq. On 19 May 2004 the U.S. government discontinued their regular payments to Chalabi for information he provided. Iraqi police, supported by U.S. soldiers, raided his offices and residence on 20 May, taking documents and computers, presumably to be used as evidence.&lt;ref name = "analysis"/&gt; A major target of the raid was [[Aras Habib]], Chalabi's long-term director of intelligence, who controlled the vast network of agents bankrolled by U.S. funding. The U.S. announced that they had stopped funding the INC, having previously paid the organization $330,000 per month.&lt;ref name = "analysis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3735973.stm |title=Analysis: Rise and fall of Chalabi |first=Roger |last=Hardy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=21 May 2004 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, it was reported that Chalabi gave U.S. state secrets to [[Iran]] in April, including the fact that one of the United States' most valuable sources of Iranian intelligence was a broken Iranian [[code (cryptography)|code]] used by their spy services.&lt;ref name = "code"/&gt; Chalabi allegedly learned of the code through a drunk American involved in the [[code-breaking]] operation.&lt;ref name = "code"&gt;James Risen and David Johnston.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 2 June 2004. Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chalabi denied all of the charges, which nothing ever came of.

An arrest warrant for alleged [[counterfeiting]] was issued for Chalabi on 8 August 2004, while at the same time a warrant was issued on murder charges against his nephew [[Salem Chalabi]] (at the time, head of the [[Iraqi Special Tribunal]]), while they both were out of the country.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2925785.stm |title=Profile: Ahmed Chalabi  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=28 April 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalabi returned to Iraq on 10 August planning to make himself available to Iraqi government officials, but he was never arrested. Charges were later dropped against Chalabi, with Judge [[Zuhair al-Maliki]] citing lack of evidence.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt;

On 1 September 2004, Chalabi told reporters of an assassination attempt made on him near [[Latifiya]], a town south of Baghdad. Chalabi reported he was returning from a meeting with Ayatollah [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani]] (whose trust Chalabi enjoyed)&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt; in [[Najaf]], where a few days earlier a cease-fire had taken effect, ending three weeks of confrontations between followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] and the U.S. military, at the time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

He regained enough credibility to be made deputy prime minister on 28 April 2005.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt; At the same time he was made acting oil minister,&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/1759|title=Chalabi Named Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Acting Oil Minister|work=newstandardnews.net|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the appointment of [[Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum]] in May 2005.  On protesting IMF austerity measures, Al-Uloum was instructed to extend his vacation by a month in December 2005 by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Chalabi was reappointed as acting oil minister.  Al-Uloum returned to the post in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/business/2006/January/business_January147.xml&amp;section=business&amp;col=|title=Iraqi oil minister  Al Uloum back at work after quitting – Khaleej Times|author =(Reuters)|work=khaleejtimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Chalabi traveled to the U.S. and met with top U.S. government officials, including Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], and National Security Advisor [[Stephen Hadley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4422638.stm |title=Chalabi US trip stirs controversy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Chalabi also traveled to Iran to meet with Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

==Political activity in Iraq, 2005–15==
The [[Iraqi National Congress]], headed by Chalabi, was a part of the [[United Iraqi Alliance]] in the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, December 2005|2005 legislative election]].  After the election, Chalabi claimed that he had the support of the majority of elected members of [[United Iraqi Alliance]] and staked claim to be the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq; however, [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] later emerged as the consensus candidate for prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20050223/ai_n11055244 Iraq's Shiite ticket picks prime minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the December 2005 elections, the Iraqi National Congress had left the United Iraqi Alliance and formed the [[National Congress Coalition]], which ran in the elections but failed to win a single seat in Parliament, gaining less than 0.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/world/middleeast/20chalabi.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Middle%20East&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |title=Early Backer of War, Finally Within Grasp of Power |first=Tim |last=Arango |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups joining the INC in this list included: Democratic Iraqi Grouping, Democratic Joint Action Front, First Democratic National Party, Independent List, Iraqi Constitutional Movement, Iraqi Constitutional Party, Tariq Abd al-Karim Al Shahd al-Budairi, and the Turkoman Decision Party.  He was refused a seat in the cabinet.  Dogged by allegations, still unproven, of corruption he retorted that he had never "participated in any scheme of intelligence against the United States."&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph, p.33"&gt;The Daily Telegraph, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalabi attended the 2006 [[Bilderberg Conference]] meeting outside of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  In October 2007, Chalabi was appointed by Prime Minister [[Nouri al Maliki]] to head the Iraqi services committee, a consortium of eight service ministries and two Baghdad municipal posts tasked with the "surge" plan's next phase, restoring electricity, health, education and local security services to Baghdad neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Chalabi Back"&gt;Nancy A.

Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "The key is going to be getting the concerned local citizens—and all the citizens—feeling that this government is reconnected with them.... [Chalabi] agrees with that," said Gen. [[David Petraeus]]. Chalabi "is an important part of the process," said Col. Steven Boylan, Petraeus' spokesman. "He has a lot of energy."&lt;ref name="Chalabi Back"/&gt; In April 2008, journalist [[Melik Kaylan]] wrote about Chalabi, "Arguably, he has, more than anyone in the country, evolved a detailed sense of what ails Baghdadis and how to fix things."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120795932252409419 Perseverance Pays Off in Baghdad], [[Melik Kaylan]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion Chalabi was placed in charge of "[[de-Ba'athification]]"—the removal of senior office holders judged to have been close supporters of the deposed Saddam Hussein.  The role fell into disuse, but in early 2010 Chalabi was accused of reviving this dormant post to eliminate his political enemies, especially Sunnis.  The banning of some 500 candidates prior to the general election of 7 March 2010 at the initiative of Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress was reported to have badly damaged previously improving relations between Shias and Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2012, ''The New York Times'' reported Western intelligence officials expressing concern that Chalabi was working with the leading opposition group in [[Bahrain]], [[Al Wefaq National Islamic Society]].  A French intelligence official said, "When we hear that some members of the opposition are in touch with [[Hezbollah]] or with shady figures like the Iraqi Ahmed Chalabi, of whom we think he is acting on behalf of [[Iran]], then this worries us".  The connection between Chalabi and Al Wefaq was acknowledged by [[Jawad Fairooz]], secretary general of Wefaq and a former member of Parliament in Bahrain.  Fairooz said, "Mr Chalabi has helped us with contacts in Washington like other people have done and we thank them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Souad Mekhennet|title=In Bahrain, Worries Grow of Violent Shiite-Sunni Confrontation|date=25 January 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/world/middleeast/26iht-m26-bahrain-conflict.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in 2014, he was shown to be frail and depressed about his country's future:

'''Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL)''' is a United Kingdom [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) scheme to give financial protection to people who have purchased [[package holiday]]s and flights from a member [[tour operator]].

== Corporate function ==
The majority of UK tour operators are required to hold an ATOL licence, without which they may not legally sell air travel. ATOL-licensed firms will have had their business practices inspected by the CAA. An ATOL licensed tour operator must also obtain insurance [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] from the CAA. The aim of this is to provide refunds to travellers affected by any event which causes the airline to be unable to provide travel for its customers, and to arrange for flights (in addition to accommodation and other items which may be included in a package holiday) to return home those already abroad at the time.

== History ==
In the 1960s, voluntary organisations such as the [[Association of British Travel Agents]] (ABTA) provided a degree of financial protection for air travellers. In 1970, the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO) (then the [[Tour Operators Study Group]]) introduced a bonding scheme whereby their members had to obtain [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to the value of 5% of their annual [[revenue|turnover]]. In 1972, ABTA followed suit.

=== Legal requirement ===
The [[Civil Aviation Act 1971]] established the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]]. Covered under this act was the creation of the original ATOL Regulations. These mandated that all tour operators whose primary mode of transport was by air (but not airlines themselves), must hold an ATOL licence. These regulations came into effect in 1973.

=== Early practice ===
On 15 August 1974, the [[Court Line]] group collapsed. It was the second largest tour operator at the time and its subsidiaries included [[Clarksons Travel Group|Clarksons Holidays]], Horizon and Medvillas. Clarksons Holidays held an ATOL licence and was therefore theoretically covered by its insurance bond. 

Although the 35,000 customers stranded abroad were successfully repatriated under the scheme, there were insufficient funds for the 100,000 people whose holidays had been paid for in advance. This was a blow to consumer confidence and led to considerable media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Aviation Authority [http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?categoryid=1080&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=6494 History of ATOL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020230310/http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?categoryid=1080&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=6494 |date=2006-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government fund called the [[Air Travel Trust]] has since been introduced to pay for any excess which is not covered by ATOL.

{{Donald Trump series}}

[[Donald Trump]] is an American businessman, former television personality, and the 45th [[President of the United States]]. He began his real estate career at his father's company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which he later renamed [[The Trump Organization]]. He rose to public prominence after concluding a number of successful real estate deals in [[Manhattan]] and [[New York City]], and his company now owns and develops lodging and [[golf courses]] around the world. Trump partly or completely owned several beauty pageants between 1996 and 2015. He has marketed his name to many building projects and [[List of things named after Donald Trump|commercial products]]. Trump's unsuccessful business ventures have included several casino and hotel bankruptcies, the folding of his [[New Jersey Generals]] football team, and the now-defunct [[Trump University]].

After being inaugurated as U.S. President in January 2017, Trump resigned all management roles within The Trump Organization, and delegated company management to his sons [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump|Eric]],&lt;ref name = "hands over"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38587628|title=Trump hands over business empire to sons|date=January 11, 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to concerns about conflicts of interest.

By 1973, Trump as president of the Trump Organization oversaw 14,000 apartments across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. In 1978, the city selected his site on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of Manhattan as the location for its [[Jacob K.

Fred was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles, after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Donald the front man in the deal.

In 1983, Trump completed development of [[Trump Tower]], a 58-story skyscraper in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The project involved complicated negotiations with different parties for the [[Bonwit Teller]] building, the land, and the airspace above a neighboring building. When negotiations were completed in 1978, ''The New York Times'' wrote "That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location ... is testimony to [his] persistence and to his skills as a negotiator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump |date=April 8, 1984 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html?pagewanted=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino|Harrah's at Trump Plaza]] opened in Atlantic City in 1984.

Trump acquired the [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], in 1985 for $5&amp;nbsp;million, plus $3&amp;nbsp;million for the home's furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in West Palm Beach with [[Lee Iacocca]] that became [[Trump Plaza (West Palm Beach)|Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooten |first=Sara McIntosh |date=2009 |title=Donald Trump: From Real Estate to Reality TV |page=62 |isbn=0-7660-2890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repairs on the [[Wollman Rink]] in [[Central Park]], built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a [[general contractor]] unconnected to Trump, with an expected {{frac|2|1|2}}-year construction schedule, but were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95&amp;nbsp;million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget, and then operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's [[Concession (contract)|concession]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freedlander|first1=David|title=A 1980s New York City Battle Explains Donald Trump's Candidacy|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-09-29/a-1980s-new-york-city-battle-explains-donald-trump-s-candidacy|accessdate=October 23, 2016|agency=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-11-01/news/26094092_1_ice-rink-donald-trump-trump-time |title=Faster and cheaper, Trump finishes N.Y.C. ice rink |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |date=November 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has owned a house on North [[Rodeo Drive]] in the [[Beverly Hills, California]]/[[Los Angeles]] area, bought for $7 million, since 2007. He bought a home next door in 2008 from [[Omar Bongo]], the president of [[Gabon]] who would die in office in 2009, for $10.35 million. Trump sold the second LA home, built in 1981, for $9,500,095 in 2009 for an $850,000 (8%) loss. The second house went back on the market in mid-2016 listed at nearly $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;Leitereg, Neal J., [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hp-hotprop-20160827-snap-story.html "Daren Metropoulos takes ownership of Playboy Mansion, Hef included &gt; A residential 'Trump' card"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', August 27, 2016.

In 1983, Trump's [[New Jersey Generals]] became a charter member of the new [[United States Football League]] (USFL). Before the inaugural season began in 1983, Trump sold the franchise to [[Oklahoma]] oil magnate J. Walter Duncan, and bought it back after the season. He then attempted to hire longtime [[Miami Dolphins]] coach [[Don Shula]], but the deal fell apart because he was unwilling to meet Shula's demand for an apartment in [[Trump Tower]]. Trump ended up hiring former [[New York Jets]] coach [[Walt Michaels]].&lt;ref name=Markazi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/04/sports/sports-people-new-jersey-generalities.html |title=Sports People; New Jersey Generalities |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=April 4, 1984 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Anderson |title=Trump Ace: Michaels |date=December 12, 1983 |website=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/12/sports/trump-ace-michaels.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the [[National Football League]] (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/and-then-there-was-the-time-donald-trump-bought-a-football-team-/2015/10/19/35ae71ca-6dd6-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html |title=And then there was the time Donald Trump bought a football team |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |author=Terris, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1985 season, Trump signed [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] to a $7&amp;nbsp;million 5-year personal-services contract. That made Flutie the highest-paid pro football player at the time, as well as the highest-paid [[rookie]] in any professional sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/04/sports/be-honest-mr-trump.html|title=Be Honest, Mr. Trump|last=Anderson|first=Dave|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 4, 1985|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the Generals merged with the [[Houston Gamblers]]. Trump owned 50% of the newly merged team, which would stay in New Jersey and retain the Generals nickname. At the time, Trump boasted "it's probably the best team in football." (New Jersey and Houston both had good but not great seasons in 1985: they each made the playoffs but lost first-round games.)

The Generals never played another game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert McG.

NFL lawsuit|lawsuit against the NFL]]: the NFL technically lost the suit, but the USFL was awarded just $3.00 in cash damages.

Trump had expressed an interest in purchasing the [[Cleveland Indians]] for $13&amp;nbsp;million in a February 15, 1983 letter sent by [[Kenneth Molloy]] to team president [[Gabe Paul]]. Trump increased his offer to $34&amp;nbsp;million later that same year. His lack of commitment to keep the franchise in [[Cleveland]] beyond three years cost him any chance of completing the acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/10/donald_trumps_bid_for_the_clev.html Larkin, Brent.

Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries.&lt;ref name=Markazi /&gt; He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks|Mike Tyson's 1988 fight]] against [[Michael Spinks]], and at one time acted as a financial advisor for [[Mike Tyson|Tyson]].&lt;ref name=Markazi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-trump-promoter-or-adviser.html |title=Sports of The Times; Trump: Promoter Or Adviser? |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=July 12, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Anderson, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/sports/trump-gets-tyson-fight.html |title=Trump Gets Tyson Fight |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=February 25, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the [[Tour de Trump]] [[cycling stage race]] which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the [[Tour de France]] or the [[Giro d'Italia]]. The name was suggested by his business partner, basketball commentator [[Billy Packer]], who originally planned to call the race the Tour de [[New Jersey|Jersey]]. The first stage of the inaugural race ended in the college town of [[New Paltz, New York]] where picketers greeted the riders with anti-Trump signs. The second stage began in New York City, and [[Mayor of New York|Mayor]] [[Ed Koch]], who had denounced Trump as "one of the great hucksters", boycotted the event. The last stage of the 10-stage 837-mile race was even more controversial. Going into the last stage, Belgian rider [[Eric Vanderaerden]] was favored to win the tour championship, but lost at least 1 minute 20 seconds when he took a wrong turn on a poorly marked course in [[Atlantic City]], riding a quarter-mile or more out of his way. He ended up finishing third overall, behind tour winner [[Dag-Otto Lauritzen]] (a Norwegian rider with the American-owned [[7-Eleven (cycling team)|7-Eleven team]]) and runner-up [[Henk Lubberding]], who also took a wrong turn during the last stage. Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990, because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/donald-trump-2016-tour-de-trump-bike-race-213801|title=The Strange Tale of Donald Trump's 1989 Biking Extravaganza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/sports/dispute-mars-end-of-the-tour-de-trump.html|title=Dispute Mars End of the Tour de Trump|first=Frank|last=Litsky|work=New York Times|date=May 15, 1989|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He accused referees of throwing [[penalty flag]]s needlessly just to be seen on television "so their wives see them at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chuck |last=Schilken |date=October 13, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-donald-trump-nfl-concussions-20161013-snap-story.html |title=Video: Donald Trump mocks the NFL for being too soft, calls concussions 'a little ding on the head' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigative story by the New York Times found that in the early 1990s in order to avoid "financial ruin" Trump's businesses used methods which were "legally dubious" to avoid paying taxes, and that Trump's own lawyers described these activities as "improper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Trump, or his tax advisers, had somehow devised a way to claim large business losses tied to debts that had been forgiven without reporting offsetting income that would have reduced his staggering loss ... documents that appear to show during the early 1990s Trump indeed used a strategy of swapping partnership interests to his creditors in exchange for having his businesses debts forgiven, eliminating the need for him to report this relief as income. There are still plenty of unknowns.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent tax experts stated that "Whatever loophole existed was not 'exploited' here, but stretched beyond any recognition" and that it involved "sleight of hand". Since the taxes were related to the reduction in Trump's extensive junk bond debt at the time and the bankruptcies of three of Trump's casinos, the methods used were probably related, according to the report, to Trump's reported $916 million loss reported on his 1995 tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-tax.html|title=Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes|date=November 1, 2016|work=The  Times|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7581">A '''business interoperability interface''' (BII) is an interface that enables business interoperability between organizational systems. The term was coined by the [[European Commission]] in the European Interoperability Framework&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2004): [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=19529 European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services – Version 1.0.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614155829/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=19529 |date=June 14, 2009 }} Retrieved 2010-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; where such interfaces are recommended to improve the interoperability of public administrations that internally use different standards.

Though the BII description of the European Commission remains vague, the following requirements are described: The BII should describe entry and exit points to the internal [[business process]]es of an organization and it should describe the contribution and commitments the collaboration partners require from each other in a formal way. Furthermore, the BII should enable the enactment of collaborative business processes and interconnect the business processes of different organizations. This description implies that the main objective of the BII is to describe to collaboration partners how they can interact with an organization.

== Interface ==
An [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interface interface] represents the point of interconnection between two systems or subsystems.  Since collaborative business always comprises interactions between organizational systems (e. g. enterprises or departments), interfaces are an essential element in the development of collaborative business processes. In the context of organizations working together, interface descriptions should describe those characteristics of a system that are relevant for adjacent systems. 
While interfaces in [[information system]]s formerly concentrated on technical aspects, e.g. by describing [[Application Programming Interfaces]], recent developments like [[Service-oriented architecture|Service-oriented Architecture]] shifted the attention to conceptual interfaces aiming at a business-level description of services and organizational boundaries.

== Business interoperability ==
In a similar vein it was argued, that previous interoperability definitions focused too much on technical aspects. In consequence, the term Business Interoperability was proposed, for example defined as "''the organizational and operational ability of an enterprise to cooperate with its business partners and to efficiently establish, conduct and develop IT-supported business relationships with the objective to create value''".&lt;ref&gt;Legner, Christine; Wende, Kristin (2006): [http://www.bledconference.org/proceedings.nsf/0/978ff10dff1d440bc125718000316bbe/$FILE/18_Legner.pdf Towards an Excellence Framework for Business Interoperability]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725084655/http://www.bledconference.org/proceedings.nsf/0/978ff10dff1d440bc125718000316bbe/%24FILE/18_Legner.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }}. Proceedings of the 19th Bled eConference eValues. Bled, Slovenia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interoperability]] is usually understood as the capability of autonomous systems "to exchange information and be able to use it",&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY: 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply put: the capability of autonomous system to work together or to [[Collaboration|collaborate]]. Since "working together" of autonomous organizations means that they execute a collaborative business process, Business Interoperability can also be defined as &lt;br /&gt; ''... the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them''.&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann (2010): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - An enterprise Model-based Approach for Describing and Enacting Collaborative Business Processes. Logos, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Based on the definitions of business interoperability and interface the term BII can be defined as follows:

''The Business Interoperability Interface of an organization comprises all information that is relevant for partner organizations in order to enact a collaborative business process with the organization. The interface comprises those elements of a collaborative business process, which are provided by the organization itself as well as the elements, the organization expects from partner organizations.''&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann, Joerg; Loos, Peter (2009): Transforming cross-organizational processes between European Administrations – Towards a comprehensive Business Interoperability Interface. In: Weerakkody, V.; Janssen, M.; Dwivedi, Y. (Eds.): Handbook of Research on ICT-Enabled Transformational Government: A Global Perspective.{{ISBN|978-1-60566-390-6}}, pp. 93–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The BII contents are not restricted to process descriptions: in order to enact a collaborative business process, the collaboration partners do not only need to know the sequence in which activities are executed but also require complementary information like organizational roles, specifics of individual activities or document types. Likewise, the description of the BII should cover different levels of technical granularity since the systematic enactment of collaborative business processes requires models on both the business and the technical level.

== Implementations ==
An EU-research project, aiming at improving interoperability between European public administrations, delivered a proposal for designing and implementing a Business Interoperability Interface, which was later refined in scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;R4eGov IOP Architecture and IOP Lifecycle (Version 1). Deliverable WP4-D7, 2008. R4eGov – Towards e-Administration in the large, project number IST-2004-026650.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration summarizes the idea of this BII implementation: Organization A and B each has an internal/private view on its information system. From this internal model, they derive a view for their collaboration partner. For example, in the public process of Organization A, only those activities of the private process from Organization A are comprised which are relevant for the collaboration partner (i.e. Organization B). All these public elements are then bundled in the BII where a collaboration partner can read them. If the elements of adjacent BII-elements fit together and all collaboration partners agreed on how to interpret them, they are also called global elements.

[[File:Business Interoperability Interface.jpg|thumb|right|Concept for a Business Interoperability Interface]]

The BII described there tackles four enterprise dimensions: In the organization dimension, roles, units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements. This ensures for example, that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles. In the data dimension, document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types. In the function dimension, business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described. In the process dimension, the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations.

== Establishment as a Co-Cathedral ==
In 1847, [[Pope Pius IX]] established the Diocese of Galveston for the 20,000 Catholics who lived in the new state of [[Texas]]. This new [[diocese]] covered an area as large as France and was served by one bishop and ten missionary priests.&lt;ref name="diocese"&gt;{{cite web| title=History| url=http://www.archgh.org/About/History/| publisher=Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the second St. Mary's parish began in 1847 in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and in 1848 it was dedicated as [[St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica|St. Mary's Cathedral]] of the newly established diocese of Galveston.  St. Mary's was the first catholic Cathedral in the state of Texas and for over 100 years it was the only cathedral in the Diocese of Galveston.&lt;ref name="look back"&gt;{{cite news| first=Tara| last=Dooley| date=30 March 2008| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2008_4541743| work=[[The Houston Chronicle]]| publisher=chron.com| title= A look back: The Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston began in a wood-frame church during the Republic of Texas| accessdate=2012-01-04| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the tremendous growth in the city of [[Houston]], in 1959, the Holy See permitted the Most Reverend Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese, to erect a cathedral of convenience in the city.&lt;ref name="bishops"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1989_661494| title=AMERICAN CATHOLICS: Bishops celebrate 200th birthday| first=Julia| last=Duin| work=The Houston Chronicle| publisher=chron.com| date=4 November 1989| accessdate=2016-03-23| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its central location, he chose Sacred Heart Church, built in 1911, to serve as co-cathedral and installed an episcopal chair. This did not change the status of the City of Galveston as an [[Episcopal see]], however it did permit full pontifical ceremonies to be held in Houston, as well as Galveston. Both cathedrals are co-equal in rank; however, since St. Mary's is the original Cathedral for the State of Texas, it has the distinction of being the Mother Cathedral for all the Catholic dioceses in Texas.&lt;ref name="repair"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2008_4541739| work=The Houston Chronicle| publisher=chron.com| title=The cradle of Texas' Catholicism: The state's first cathedral in need of major repair| first=Richard| last=Vara| date=30 March 2008| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, in recognition of the Galveston Cathedral's importance to the community and state, as well as its historical role as the [[mother church]] for Catholicism in the state of Texas, [[Pope John Paul II]] elevated St. Mary's to the status of Cathedral [[Basilica]].&lt;ref name="basilica"&gt;{{cite web| title=The History of The Mother Church of Texas| url=http://www.marycath.org/site/History/tabid/101/Default.aspx| publisher=St. Mary Cathedral Basilica| year=2009| accessdate=2011-01-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124070109/http://www.marycath.org/site/History/tabid/101/Default.aspx| archivedate=2010-11-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Sacred Heart Parish ==
[[File:OldSacredHeartCoCathedral.JPG|thumb|left|The old Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart]]
The third Bishop of Galveston, Nicholas A. Gallagher, established Sacred Heart [[parish]] in downtown [[Houston]] as the fourth parish in the city on November 22, 1896, to serve the growing Catholic population. The Reverend Thomas Keaney, became the first pastor of Sacred Heart Church.

On March 11, 1897, Keaney purchased property facing Pierce and Fannin Streets and architect Olle J. Lorehn drew plans for a gothic-style church.&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{cite web| title=Former Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral| url=http://www.houstonarchitecture.com/Building/2193/Former-Sacred-Heart-Co-Cathedral.php| publisher=HoustonArchitecture.com| accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, construction on Lorehn's design would not begin until 1911. To serve the congregation in the interim, a small church was built on the corner of Pierce and San Jacinto Streets. Bishop Gallagher laid the cornerstone for the temporary sanctuary on May 16, 1897, and dedicated it on November 6, 1897.

On June 11, 1911, Bishop Gallagher laid the [[cornerstone]] of the present Sacred Heart Church. The church was dedicated to God’s service on April 14, 1912, at a final cost of $96,669. The new Sacred Heart Church accommodated 800 people, and was three stories. After the completion of the new Sacred Heart, the temporary church became the school building.

Father Morgan J. Crow, the fourth pastor of Sacred Heart, constructed a two-story, brick rectory that was completed and occupied in 1920 to replace the wooden structure. In 1922, the original church building was demolished to make way for a new school building at a cost of $52,800.

Monsignor Jerome A. Rapp, the fifth pastor of Sacred Heart (1927–1952), oversaw much of the interior decoration of the church including acquiring statuary.  His successor, Monsignor John J. Roach, installed central heating and air-conditioning in 1953 and in 1954, expanded the parish footprint by acquiring adjacent property at Fannin and Calhoun Streets.  With this purchase, the parish owned an entire city block.&lt;ref name=

Monsignor Roach had the exteriors of the church and school refurbished in 1957, enlarged the [[sacristy]] and made other alterations in addition to constructing a new rectory.  In 1964, he oversaw renovation of the interior of Sacred Heart.

The final interior renovation of the Co-Cathedral was completed in 1990 with the rededication on March 25, 1990, by Bishop [[Joseph Fiorenza|Joseph A. Fiorenza]].  Changes included a new episcopal chair and a total of three new mosaics that were designed and made in Italy. The first mosaic is of Christ the pantocrator above the episcopal chair represents [[Jesus]] as the shepherd and teacher of the church. The second mosaic is a [[Eucharistic]] symbol taken from the miracle of the multiplication of the five loaves and two fish. Above this mosaic is the Coat of Arms for the late Pope John Paul II. The third mosaic depicts a baptismal theme and the death and resurrection of Christ. The three mosaics were installed by Italo Botti of Chicago.&lt;ref name="abridged"&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Co-Cathedral 1896-1991| url=http://www.sacredhearthouston.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=208| publisher=Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Father Troy Gately, in December 2006, the Co-Cathedral parish purchased the former [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch|Federal Reserve Bank Building]], adjacent to the new Co-Cathedral for $5,000,000, and named it Cathedral Centre.  It will replace the 1922 Sacred Heart School building to house classrooms, offices, parish hall, youth rooms, child care center, music rooms, library, and a cafeteria. The parish is expected to spend another $2,000,000 on renovations for the new Cathedral Centre.&lt;ref name="tandem"&gt;{{cite web| title=Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart; A History in Tandem With Houston| url=http://www.sacredhearthouston.org/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=209| publisher=Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of the new Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral ==
[[Image:CoCathedralinteriorHoustonTexas.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cathedral nave and sanctuary]]
By the 2000s, the archdiocese had long outgrown the 90-year-old Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. Since it was constructed as a parish church, it had been enlarged over the years through a patchwork of renovations and additions and rather than make more costly additions, the Archdiocese decided to construct a new Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart.

Ziegler Cooper Architects of Houston was selected to design and Linbeck Group was selected as general contractor. In the spring of 2002, design began for the new co-cathedral.&lt;ref name="ziegler"/&gt;  Working with Joseph Fiorenza, then Bishop of Galveston-Houston, a model was constructed of the final design concept. Bishop Fiorenza took a picture of the co-cathedral model to the Vatican where he reportedly obtained approval of the design from [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lights are on at last at Houston's new co-cathedral| work=The Houston Chronicle| accessdate=2012-01-04| date=28 March 2008| url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/5656621.html| last=Dooley| first=Tara| publisher=chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2005, newly elevated Archbishop Fiorenza presided over a groundbreaking ceremony for the new co-cathedral and construction began shortly afterwards. The new Sacred Heart serves the archdiocese as both an ecclesiastical and [[civic center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ground Breaking| accessdate=2012-01-04| url=http://www.diogh.org/cocathedral/article-groundbreaking.htm| publisher=Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229080914/http://www.diogh.org/cocathedral/article-groundbreaking.htm| archivedate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building footprint is {{convert|27800|sqft|m2}} occupying on a site of {{convert|37000|sqft|m2}}. The co-cathedral seats 1,820 with room for an additional 200 temporary chairs.  The co-cathedral is designed in a simplified [[Romanesque architecture|Italian Romanesque]] style with a cruciform shape.  The exterior is clad in [[Indiana Limestone]] and the interior is accented with {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of marble.  The shallow dome over the crossing extends to a height of {{convert|117|ft|m}} over the {{convert|72|ft|m}}-tall nave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, Building materials |accessdate=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.diogh.org/cocathedral/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228122253/http://www.diogh.org/cocathedral/index.htm |archivedate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exterior dome is clad in copper and capped by a gilded crucifix while the interior features an {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} occulus depicting the Holy Spirit in stained glass.&lt;ref name="ziegler"/&gt;  The [[campanile]] is {{convert|140|ft|m}} high.

Most Reverend Joseph A. Fiorenza, now [[Archbishop Emeritus]] of the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese oversaw construction of the new co-cathedral. In one of his articles in the ''Texas Catholic Herald'', Fiorenza was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "A Great Cathedral For A Great City"..."We stand today on the threshold of a tremendous era of growth and opportunity for our diocese...we will build the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in the center of Houston, a great modern city. This glorious cathedral will stand as a powerful symbol of the transcendence of God, and as an affirmation of the existence and importance of faith in a secular and disbelieving world. The Cathedral will serve as a soul and conscience of the city, reminding us of the importance of the spiritual amid the bustle of the commercial and corporate worlds - of the fact that God exists and faith matters."&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The existence of the Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral does not affect the status of St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica in Galveston. Both the cathedral and co-cathedral will continue to serve the needs of the citizens of the archdiocese.

On April 2, 2008, the New Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart open its doors with a dedication Mass, attended by [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishops]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] from across the [[United States]] and around the world. The new Co-Cathedral was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Cardinal Daniel DiNardo Archbishop of Galveston-Houston and Archbishop Joseph A. Fiorenza. The final cost of the new Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart was [[United States dollar|US$]]49,000,000.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedication of the co-cathedral| url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6053988| first=Elissa| last=Rivas| date=3 April 2008| work=KTRK-TV News| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
[[File:CoCathedralsouthHoustonTexas.JPG|thumb|right|Main façade]]
Since construction of the Co-Cathedral was completed in April 2008, Linbeck Group (the General Contractor) has been awarded numerous accolades for its work on the project. The list of awards includes, the 2008 ASA Excellence in Construction Award, 2008 AGC Standard of Excellence Award, 2008 CSI Houston Craftsmanship Award, 2008 AGC Houston Apex Award, 2008 TBB AGC Outstanding Construction Award, 2008 Texas Construction Judges Award, 2008 McGraw-Hill Best of the Best Award and 2009 AGC Build America Award.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Future use of the old Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral ==
Shortly after the opening of the new structure, the archdiocese announced that the 1912 church building that served as the Co-Cathedral would be demolished and the site would become a parking lot for the new church. However, due to an outcry from parishioners and preservationists, the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston has sought ways to use the former church building.

In 2004, Preservation Texas added Sacred Heart to the 2004 list of Texas' Most Endangered Historic Places.&lt;ref name="preservation"&gt;{{cite web| title=2004 Texas' Most Endangered Places| url=http://preservationtexas.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:2004-texas-most-endangered-places&amp;catid=3:most-endangered&amp;Itemid=11| publisher=Preservation Texas| accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, The Greater Houston Preservation Alliance (GHPA) a local organization in Houston did the same.&lt;ref name="ghpa"&gt;{{cite news| title=Alamo School among state's endangered sites| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2009_4700435| work=The Houston Chronicle| publisher=chron.com| first=Allan| last=Turner| date=12 February 2009| accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archdiocese announced plans in late 2007 to demolish the 1922 Sacred Heart School building to provide parking for the new Co-Cathedral across San Jacinto Street. A master plan includes the eventual demolition of the former school building for a parking lot and the removal of the parking lot behind the old church to replace the asphalt parking lot with a landscaped park to be known as Cathedral Green. There are no current plans for the removal of the rectory or the old church building. However, it is possible that 1957 rectory and the 1912 Sacred Heart Church building may be saved. The Archdiocese at this point has not made a final decision on the future of the old Sacred Heart, but the final decision is in the hands of Cardinal DiNardo.

The original sanctuary is no longer used for services. For a short time after the opening of the new structure, weddings were permitted at the old Co-Cathedral. However, the Archdiocese has moved all activities to the new Co-Cathedral Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cathedral Centre at Cathedral Place |url=http://www.sacredhearthouston.org/Sursum_Corda/current.pdf |accessdate=May 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |work=Sursum Corda! |date=Fall 2007 |volume=7 |issue=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424032512/http://www.sacredhearthouston.org/Sursum_Corda/current.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a '''communication-enabled business process''' (CEBP) is to optimize [[business process]] by reducing the human latency that exists within a process flow. For example, a mortgage approval process may be experiencing human latency because the person assigned to providing an approval is on vacation or busy working on something else. To reduce this latency, CEBP leverages [[unified communications]]  capabilities (i.e. UC services) by embedding them into the business process flow. The result is a more efficient, more automated closed-loop process; translating into significant ROI.

If the person does not provide the necessary approval within a designated period of time then the business process would invoke a UC service such as “notify and respond” from an [[IP PBX]], voice portal/IVR, conferencing application, etc. These embedded UC services would “notify” the person that they need to do something. If the person does not “respond” to the notification then it can be escalated to a manager in the same manner.

==Types of services==
In fact, there are a number of UC services that could be embedded within a business process to reduce human latency. These could include: conference [on demand], alert, escalate, contact resident expert, etc.; all of which create measurable business value.

==Advantages==
The great thing about CEBP is that it can be applied horizontally across different lines of business and different industries. Virtually every business process is hampered by human latency. Some other use cases that CEBP can be applied to include: roadside assistance, stock portfolio alerts, personal information loss, claims processing, inventory management, etc. Here is a more detailed example:

===CEBP example===
In claims processing, the organization’s goal is to decrease claim close times and improve their closure rate. However, this process is often hampered by several inefficiencies – the paperwork process can be manually intensive; time-sensitive dependencies on member signatures exist, resulting in significant delays in the approval process.

A CEBP solution would be implemented to automate and communications-enable the claims process with embedded UC services like: reminders, alerts, and notifications.

Quantifiable business results could include: decreased close times; greater agent/specialist productivity, enabling them to spend more time adjusting claims rather than fielding calls on the claims; increased revenue and member satisfaction/retention.

== CEBP versus unified communications ==
Many UC vendors claim that they do CEBP today. However, one very important distinction needs to be made…there is a difference between communications integrated into business process and communications enabled business process. 

It is person triggered as illustrated in examples like adding a click-to-dial function to an ERP or CRM application. As described above, CEBP is much more sophisticated in its ability to automate business process flows; it is usually event triggered, providing a much stronger ROI to many lines of business and vertical industries.

'''Edholm's law''', named for [[Phil Edholm]], says the [[wireless]], nomadic and wired network capabilities will converge. Soon, even slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems will eclipse the capacity of early [[Ethernet]], thanks to upcoming standards known as [[UMTS]] and [[MIMO]], which will boost bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage.

Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030.

'''Enkeltpersonforetak''' (ENK) is a type of [[sole proprietorship]] in [[Norway]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The company is considered part of the personal assets of the owner, who holds the full juridical and economic [[Legal liability|liability]] of the company. The sole proprietorship entity holds a number of advantages, such as that there is no minimum [[Shareholders' equity|equity]], requirements for [[auditing]] or registration fee at the [[Brønnøysund Register Centre]]. Sole proprietorships do not have to have the two or three letter corresponding company type in the official company name. Instead they are required to have the [[surname]] of the proprietor somewhere in the company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bedin.no/php/d_emneside_eng/cf/hApp_102/hPKey_1613/hParent_17/hDKey_2 | title=Self-employed Business | publisher=Ministry of Trade and Industry | date=3 March 2008 | accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">The '''European Fair Trade Association''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] association established informally in 1987. It gained formal status in 1990. It regroups 11 [[fair trade]] importers in 9 European countries: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. EFTA members include [[Ctm altromercato]], [[Gepa3 Fair Handelshaus]] and [[Traidcraft]]. EFTA's aim is to support its member organizations in their work and encourage cooperation and coordination.

[[Fair trade]] importing organizations buy food and [[handicrafts]] from disadvantaged producers in [[developing countries]] and aim at improving market access and strengthening producer organizations. EFTA members generally follow [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO) Standards, to which additional standards may be added with the aim of providing special support to particular target groups (women, ethnic minorities, politically persecuted, etc.). In [[Europe]], they sell their products through [[Worldshops]], local groups, wholesalers and mail order catalogues. [[Fair trade]] importing organizations also play an important role in awareness raising and in educating consumers and public authorities on [[fair trade]] and [[trade justice]] issues.

The term '''export''' in [[international trade]] means the sending of [[goods]] or [[Service (business)|services]] produced in one country to another country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an ''exporter''; the foreign buyer is referred to as an ''importer''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rakesh Mohan Joshi|Joshi, Rakesh Mohan]], (2005) International Marketing, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York. {{ISBN|0-19-567123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Export of goods often requires involvement of [[customs]] authorities. An export's reverse counterpart is an [[import]].

== Exporting ==
Many manufacturing firms began their global expansion as exporters and only later switched to another mode for serving a foreign market.&lt;ref name=washington&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=Charles W. L. Hill, University of|title=International business : competing in the global marketplace|date=2015|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|page=454|edition=Tenth edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{what|date=December 2017}}

== Process ==
Methods of exporting a product or good or information include mail, hand delivery, air shipping, shipping by vessel, uploading to an internet site, or downloading from an internet site. Exports also include distribution of information sent as email, an email attachment, fax or in a telephone conversation.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Barriers ==
[[Trade barrier]]s are government laws, [[regulation]]s, [[policies|policy]], or practices that either protect domestic products from foreign competition or artificially [[stimulate]] exports of particular domestic products. While restrictive business practices sometimes have a similar effect, they are not usually regarded as trade barriers. The most common foreign trade barriers are government-imposed measures and policies that restrict, prevent, or impede the international exchange of goods and services.&lt;ref name="trade_barriers"&gt;{{cite web |title = Targeted Trade Barriers |url = http://www.cftech.com/BrainBank/INTERNATIONALAFFAIRS/TargTradBarr.html |publisher = cftech.com |accessdate = 27 July 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131404555300/http://www.cftech.com/BrainBank/INTERNATIONALAFFAIRS/TargTradBarr.html |archivedate = 5 December 2017 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic ===
International agreements limit trade in and the transfer of, certain types of goods and information e.g. goods associated with weapons of mass destruction, advanced telecommunications, arms and torture, and also some art and [[archaeological artefact]]s. For example:
* [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] limits trade in nuclear weapons and associated goods (45 countries participate).
* The [[Australia Group]] limits trade in chemical &amp; biological weapons and associated goods (39 countries).
* [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] limits trade in the means of delivering weapons of mass destruction (35 countries)
* The [[Wassenaar Arrangement]] limits trade in conventional arms and technological developments (40 countries).

=== Tariffs ===
A [[tariff]] is a tax placed on a specific good or set of goods exported from or imported to a country, creating an economic barrier to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp|title=Tariff|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=7 May 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132115263600/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp|archivedate=5 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Usually the tactic is used when a country's domestic output of the good is falling and imports from foreign competitors are rising, particularly if the country has strategic reasons to retain a domestic [[production (economics)|production]] capability. &lt;br /&gt;Some failing industries receive a protection with an effect similar to [[subsidies]]; tariffs reduce the industry's incentives to produce goods quicker, cheaper, and more efficiently. The third reason for a tariff involves addressing the issue of [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]. Dumping involves a country producing highly excessive amounts of goods and ''dumping'' the goods on another country at prices that are "too low", for example,  pricing the good lower in the export market than in the domestic market of the country of origin. In dumping the producer sells the product at a price that returns no profit, or even amounts to a loss.&lt;ref name="tariff"&gt;{{cite web |author = Mike Mofatt |title = The Economic Effect of Tariffs |url = http://economics.about.com/cs/taxpolicy/a/tariffs.htm |accessdate = 27 July 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075517/http://economics.about.com/cs/taxpolicy/a/tariffs.htm |archivedate = 6 September 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and expected outcome of a tariff is to encourage spending on domestic goods and services rather than imports.

Tariffs can create tension between countries. Examples include the [[United States steel tariff 2002|United States steel tariff of 2002]] and when China placed a 14% tariff on imported auto parts. Such tariffs usually lead to a complaint with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/060330b/ US/China Trade Tensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516004140/http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/060330b/ |date=16 May 2011 }}, [[Public Broadcasting Service|Darren Gersh]]. Retrieved 21 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; If that fails, the country may put a tariff of its own against the other nation in retaliation, and to increase pressure to remove the tariff.

=== Overview ===
==== Advantages of exporting ====

* Exporting has two distinct advantages. First, it avoids the often substantial cost of establishing manufacturing operations in the host country.&lt;ref name=hill2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W.L.|title=International Business: competing in the global marketplace|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0078112775|page=454|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, exporting may help a company achieve [[experience curve effects]] and [[economics of location|location economies]].&lt;ref name=hill2015 /&gt;
Ownership advantages are the firm's specific [[asset]]s, international experience, and the ability to develop either [[Porter generic strategies#Cost Leadership Strategy|low-cost]] or [[Porter generic strategies#Differentiation Strategy|differentiated products]] within the contacts of its [[value chain]]. The locational advantages of a particular market are a combination of [[Gap analysis#Market potential|market potential]] and [[financial risk|investment risk]]. [[Internationalization]] advantages are the benefits of retaining a [[core competence]] within the company and threading it though the value chain rather than to [[license]], [[outsource]], or sell it. 

In relation to the [[eclectic paradigm]], companies that have low levels of ownership advantages do not enter foreign markets. If the company and its products are equipped with ''ownership advantage'' and ''internalization advantage'', they enter through low-risk modes such as exporting. Exporting requires significantly lower level of investment than other modes of international expansion, such as [[foreign direct investment|FDI]]. The lower risk of export typically results in a lower [[rate of return]] on sales than possible though other modes of [[international business]]. In other words, the usual return on export sales may not be tremendous, but neither is the risk. Exporting allows managers to exercise operation control but does not provide them the option to exercise as much marketing control. An exporter usually resides far from the end consumer and often enlists various intermediaries to manage [[marketing management|marketing activities]]. After two straight months of contraction, exports from India rose by 11.64% at $25.83 billion in July 2013 against $23.14 billion in the same month of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exports surge to 21-month high|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/exports-up-over-11-in-july-113081200326_1.html|website=Business Standard India|date=13 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815190708/http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/exports-up-over-11-in-july-113081200326_1.html|archivedate=15 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disadvantages of exporting ====
'''Exporting has a number of drawbacks:'''
* Exporting from the firm's home base may not be appropriate if lower-cost locations for manufacturing the product can be found abroad. It may be preferable to manufacture where conditions are most favorable to value creation, and to export to the rest of the world from that location.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt;
* A second drawback to exporting, is that high transport cost can make exporting uneconomical, particularly for bulk products. One way to fix this, is to manufacture bulk products regionally.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt;
* Another drawback, is that high tariff barriers can make exporting uneconomical and very risky.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt;

For [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees, selling goods and services to foreign markets can be more difficult than serving the domestic market. The lack of knowledge of [[trade regulation]]s, cultural differences, different languages and [[foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange]] situations, as well as the strain of resources and staff, interact like a block for exporting. Indeed, there are some SMEs which are exporting, but nearly two-thirds of them sell to only one foreign market.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J., Radebaugh, L., Sullivan, D. (2007). International Business: environment and operations, 11th edition. [[Prentice Hall]]. {{ISBN|0-13-186942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Export motivations and perceptions ==
Motivational factors are "all those factors triggering the decision of the firm to initiate and develop export activities". In the literature, export barriers are divided into four large categories: motivational, informational, operational/resource-based, and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Government export promotion: A global perspective|last=Seringhaus|first=F. R|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|isbn=0415000645|location=https://www.amazon.com/Government-Export-Promotion-Perspective-International/dp/0415000645|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,  export motivators are divided into five dimensions; reactive, marketing,export, technological, external.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stouraitis|first=Vassilios|last2=Harun|first2=Mior Harris Mior|last3=Kyritsis|first3=Markos|date=5 January 2017|title=Motivators of SME initial export choice and the European Union regional effect in manufacturing|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJEBR-05-2015-0120|journal=International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior &amp; Research|volume=23|issue=1|pages=35–55|doi=10.1108/ijebr-05-2015-0120|issn=1355-2554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that exporters are more favourable to motivators than non-exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonidou|first=Leonidas C.|last2=Katsikeas|first2=Constantine S.|last3=Palihawadana|first3=Dayananda|last4=Spyropoulou|first4=Stavroula|date=6 November 2007|title=An analytical review of the factors stimulating smaller firms to export: Implications for policy‐makers|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/02651330710832685|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=735–770|doi=10.1108/02651330710832685|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located along Sixteenth Street, the school was designed by [[Joseph Anschutz]] and built under the direction of Charles O'Neill, Jr.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  The three-[[storey|story]] brick building was built in a regular rectangular plan in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style of architecture, with three [[chimney]]s dominating its [[facade]].&lt;ref name=nomination&gt;Mintz, Elizabeth.&lt;!-- "B.

[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]: [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]], August 1986.  Accessed 2010-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}}

The school was named for [[Francis Martin Drexel]], whose son, banker and philanthropist [[Anthony J. Drexel]], founded [[Drexel University]] two years after the construction of the school.

==The school==

At the time of the Drexel School's construction, Philadelphia's school system had a decentralized administration, with Drexel being a part of the Twenty-sixth Section.&lt;ref name="custis"/&gt;  The school buildings, however, were designed by the central administration.&lt;ref name=mps /&gt;

The Drexel family was intensely involved with education at this time. Anthony J. Drexel, as the partner of [[J.P. Morgan]], was an internationally important financier, and as the partner of [[George William Childs|George W. Childs]], publisher of the Philadelphia ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'', was influential in local affairs as well.  He was a close friend of Childs, and together they worked to offer free or inexpensive education to the working class.  According to Childs, Drexel gave "many munificent gifts to established educational and charitable institutions," as well as founding and endowing the Drexel Institute, which later became [[Drexel University]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs, George W., in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', reprinted as "Two Noble Lives" in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=s-MBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Pennsylvania School Journal], V. 42, Sept. 1893, pp. 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Drexel's orphaned niece, [[Katherine Drexel]], sought advice from Childs and Drexel on her plans to become a nun in the service of educating [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s and [[African-American]]s.  This work led to her [[beatification]] by Pope John II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Rottenberg | first =Dan | title =The Man Who Made Wall Street: Anthony J.

Completed in 1889,&lt;ref name=nomination /&gt;{{Rp|2}} the Drexel School included features common to late nineteenth-century Philadelphia schools.  Earlier schools were generally built entirely of [[brick]], and the 1870s saw the introduction of [[Stonemasonry|stone]] schools, but schools built between 1883 and 1900, including Drexel, typically combined brick walls and [[brownstone]] finishing.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;Moak, Jefferson M., et al. ''{{NRHP url|id=64000730|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Philadelphia Public Schools Thematic Resources}}''. [[National Park Service]], August 1986.  Accessed 2010-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|6}}

Anschutz worked in the tradition of Samuel Sloan's "Philadelphia Plan" of school architecture: On each floor, classrooms opened onto a single corridor, and were divided by moveable partitions.  Coatrooms were provided in each classroom. Stairways and other non-classroom space were located at the end of the corridor, near the outside of the building.&lt;ref name=mps/&gt;{{Rp|9–10}} The architectural plans closely follow these principles.  The school's windows were enlarged in 1914, and in 1922, lighting was changed from gas to electric.&lt;ref&gt;Original architectural drawings are available online at www.thedrexelschool.com sub-page "Blueprints"&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it originally housed classes for both [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[Secondary school|secondary]] students,  Drexel was built at a time when school boards were beginning to open separate schools for different purposes.&lt;ref name = "custis"&gt;Custis, John Trevor. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cggUAAAAIAAJ The Public Schools of Philadelphia: Historical, Biographical, Statistical.]'' Philadelphia: Burk &amp; McFetridge, 1897, pp. 429-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mps /&gt;{{Rp|11}}  It remained in use by the [[School District of Philadelphia|Philadelphia Public Schools]] into the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name=nomination /&gt;{{Rp|1}}

==Recognition and demolition==
In 1986, the Francis Drexel School was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in recognition of its architectural significance.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  While many Philadelphia schools had been modeled on the Drexel School in the late nineteenth century, most had been destroyed or significantly remodeled; only Drexel and two other schools remained in a condition similar to that of their original construction.&lt;ref name=nomination /&gt;{{Rp|2}}  Fifty-two other Philadelphia schools, including five designed by Anschutz,&lt;ref name=mps /&gt;{{Rp|11}} were added to the Register on the same day as part of the Philadelphia Public Schools [[multiple property submission]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

The Drexel School was demolished in February, 2010.&lt;!--why? this should be explained--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;View of the school provided by [[:File:Drexel School 3.JPG|this]] picture&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75148">The '''Grubb Family Iron Dynasty''' was a succession of iron manufacturing enterprises owned and operated by Grubb family members for more than 165 years. Collectively, they were [[Pennsylvania]]'s leading iron manufacturer between 1840 and 1870.

About 1737, [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]] entered the iron business after discovering the vast and rich [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Iron Mines]] (Cornwall Banks) in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], about 21 miles north of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. Peter and the next five generations of his descendants operated and expanded the business until they owned or operated in close association with at least 18 iron production operations and several thousand acres of property in eastern Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = trail&gt;{{cite book | last = Dieffenbach | first = Susan | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Cornwall Iron Furnace, Pennsylvania Trail of History Guide | publisher = Stackpole Books  | year = 2003 | location =  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=73rVQ-XYaVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=MOUNT+HOPE+Furnace+pennsylvania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KO6cfA2fOp&amp;sig=KJMW5fN6kNG9l9pohzIqKblxmu4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r9z9TP2wJYr0tgOZwtmvCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=MOUNT%20HOPE%20Furnace%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb&gt;{{cite book | last = Grubb | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = The Grubb Family of Grubb's Landing, Delaware | publisher = Higginson Book Co  | year = 2008 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Collection 212, Forges and Furnaces Collection, 1727 - 1921 | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid212forgesandfurnaces.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHRP nom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H001078_01H.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|PHMC]] and [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PDT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grubb's heirs sold most of the original properties between 1786 and 1803 to [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]], who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire and whose operations were continued through the 19th century by his heirs.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert&gt;{{cite book | last = Dibert | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Iron, Independence and Inheritance - the Story of Curttis and Peter Grubb | publisher = Cornwall Iron Furnace Associates  | year = 2000 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1800, the heirs of Curtis' brother [[Peter Grubb, Jr.]] rebuilt their business on the minority interest they retained, primarily in the Cornwall Iron Mines, and operated for nearly 100 years out of [[Mount Hope Estate|Mount Hope]].&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt; The Grubb and Coleman families were competitors, but also partners due to their shared interests in the ore fields.

Both families' operations bowed to the advances of iron and steel technology in the latter part of the 19th century and were gradually sold between 1883 and 1926. Many of the Grubb holdings and the Cornwall Iron Mines were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (which was itself acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] in 1916). The remaining Coleman holdings and the related Robesonia Iron Company were also sold to Bethlehem Steel, in 1919 and 1926 respectively. Bethlehem Steel continued to mine iron ore at Cornwall until 1973.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

== The people ==
In 1677, [[John Grubb]] came from Cornwall, U.K., and settled in [[Brandywine Hundred]], Delaware, where he established a tannery. His son Peter launched iron operations that eventually linked six generations of people, including:

=== 1st generation ===

:*[[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb Sr.]] (1702–1754): Founded the Cornwall Ironworks when he discovered the vast iron ore fields at [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall, PA]], about 1737 and built the [[Cornwall Furnace]] and [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] by 1742. He leased the operations to Cury &amp; Company until 1765 and removed to Wilmington, Delaware, where he bought and sold real estate and lived out his life. Succeeding family generations built their fortunes on his discovery.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== 2nd generation ===

:*[[Curtis Grubb]] (1730–1789): Peter's eldest son and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]. 4/6 owner-in-common of the Cornwall Ironworks and operator of the Cornwall Furnace from 1765 to 1789. Built the Union Forge in 1882. His pending remarriage in 1783 spawned inheritance issues that led to the 1885-6 partition of the Grubb holdings. By 1795, Curtis' holdings had been sold by his heirs to Robert Coleman; they had all died by 1805.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt; Curtis did have a son, [[Jehu Grubb]], unacknowledged and not an heir, who became an early settler and leading citizen of [[Stark County, Ohio]].

:*[[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Grubb Jr.]] (1740–1786): Peter's youngest son and Patriot. 2/6 owner-in-common of the Cornwall Ironworks and operator of the Hopewell Forges from 1765 to 1786. He reacted to the forced partition by building his own Mount Hope Furnace in 1784 to compete with his brother; he took his own life in 1786. His heirs rebuilt the family iron business from Mount Hope in the 19th century.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== 3rd generation ===

:*Peter Grubb III (1757–1805): Curtis' eldest son and heir, was actually called Peter Jr. at the time to distinguish him from his uncle Peter; however, this article uses Peter III to distinguish him from his uncle Peter Jr. A former officer and prisoner of war in the Revolution, he began the gradual sale of the Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman when he sold his inherited 1/3 share of the Hopewell Forges and 1/6 share of the rest of the Cornwall Ironworks to him in 1785.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Curtis Grubb Jr. (1772–1790): Curtis' son and principal heir, inherited his father's remaining 3/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks but soon left it to his sister Elizabeth when he died as a teenager in 1790. He mentioned his half-brother [[Jehu Grubb]] in his will.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Elizabeth Grubb (c. 1775 – after 1795): Curtis' daughter and subsequent heir, inherited the 3/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks from her late brother Curtis Jr. and furthered the gradual sale of the Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman by selling her share to him in 1795.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Alan Burd Grubb (1772–1828): Peter Jr.'s eldest son, inherited half of his father's estate but sold it to his brother Henry in 1798 for $29,266.  He became a physician in Tennessee.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

:*[[Henry Bates Grubb]] (1774–1823): Peter Jr.'s youngest son, founded and built the 19th-century Grubb family iron empire from 1800 to 1823, building on the legacy of his father's Mount Hope Furnace and remaining 2/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks. Henry financed his efforts, including the purchase of additional properties, with proceeds from the final sale of most of the original Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman; their transactions in 1798 and 1802 left Coleman with the Hopewell Forges and Henry with the Mount Hope Furnace and only a 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore bank.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Harriett Amelia Buckley Grubb (1788–1858): Henry's widow, oversaw the Grubb operations for several years after his death, until the sons came of age.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== 4th generation ===

:*Curtis Grubb (1781–1847), son of Peter Grubb III, owned the [[Gray's Ferry Tavern|Gray's Ferry Inn]] south of Philadelphia from 1805 to 1825.

:*[[Edward Burd Grubb, Sr.]] (1810–1867): Henry's eldest son, was sent to Europe in 1830 to study the latest iron technology. He returned to partner with his brother Clement in 1833, under the name E. &amp; C.B., to run the family business, then consisting of interests in at least five properties. They rebuilt the old furnaces and expanded the operations. In 1837 he moved his family to Burlington, NJ, where he became one of its leading citizens and an ardent abolitionist.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

He sold his half interest in the Mount Hope Estate to his younger brother Alfred in 1845 and moved to Lancaster. He left E. &amp; C.B. about that time, apparently to strike out on his own. He acquired the Chestnut Hill Ore Banks by 1851 and built the St. Charles Furnace in 1852. In 1872, Clement formed a new partnership with his son Charles (C.B. Grubb and Son) and they purchased the Henry Clay Furnace (renamed St. Charles #2) in 1875. At his death, Clement was said to have been the wealthiest person in Lancaster County.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = pasteelco /&gt;

:*Alfred Bates Grubb (1821–1885): Henry's youngest son, was involved in the family business and acquired a half interest in the Mount Hope Estate for $25,000 from his brother Clement in 1845.  He continued to manage Mount Hope, and was involved with Edward and Edward's heirs until at least 1873. After Alfred's death in 1885, Mount Hope was sold back to Clement for $300,000. Alfred's children were not involved in the iron business.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = pareports&gt;{{cite book| title = Pennsylvania State Reports, Vol. 101 |publisher = Pennsylvania Supreme Court | year = 1888 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-gNAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=e.b+%26+a.b+grubb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DdJyZoKAwp&amp;sig=vCoOrM-LqZf2bzvz0xDe8lkCntQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f1wiTZrlOoOqsAOZ1vSzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=e.b%20%26%20a.b%20grubb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hopesale /&gt;

== The Cornwall era (1734–1800) ==

Cornwall, Pennsylvania, was the center of the early Grubb Family Iron Dynasty in the 18th century. It later served a similar role for the Coleman Family operations.

=== The founding (1st generation, 1734–65) ===

The Grubb family enterprises began when [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]], a stonemason by training, discovered at [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania]] between 1734 and 1737, what proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of [[Lake Superior]]. Grubb purchased 1,000 acres of iron-rich property and began manufacturing activities at the [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] and [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] in 1742.  The business thrived at Cornwall, operating until 1765 under lease by a group of businessmen named Cury &amp; Company, while Grubb removed to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], where he lived out his life.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== The patriot years (2nd generation, 1765–89) ===

Peter's sons [[Curtis Grubb]] and [[Peter Grubb, Jr.]] inherited the iron works after their father died in 1754, and took over operation in 1765. The [[ironmaster]] brothers were both [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots of the American Revolution]] and Colonels of local militia; their iron works developed and supplied significant quantities of cannon and other munitions to the war effort. With the heavy demand for iron products and the accompanying inflation during the war, the brothers (and other ironmasters) realized handsome profits in the service of their new country. Curtis added the Union Forge to the holdings about 1782. They continued to operate the iron works, producing several hundred tons annually, Curtis at the Cornwall Furnace and Peter at the Hopewell Forges, until they died, Peter Jr. in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Their residential mansions at both locations still stand today.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== The partition and divestiture (1783–1803) ===

The Grubb brothers unfortunately had a serious falling out beginning in 1783, when Curtis' pending remarriage spawned inheritance anxieties by his oldest son Peter III, 26, who had been a Captain of the [[Continental Army]] and a prisoner of war. Curtis acquiesced and decided to give his son his inheritance before the wedding, which subsequently required the courts to formally partition the family operations and allocate ownership shares among Curtis, Peter Jr., and Peter III.

Peter Jr. retained a 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges but only a 1/3 interest in the rest of the holdings (Cornwall Furnace and Ore Banks, and Union Forge&lt;ref name = unionforge /&gt;). Peter III received the remaining 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus a 1/6 interest in the rest.  Peter Jr. feared for the future supply of raw pig iron to his Hopewell Forges that was to become his legacy to his sons, so he decided to build his own furnace at a place south of Cornwall he called [[Mount Hope Estate|Mount Hope]], where he had purchased 212 acres. The brothers were now in competition and their relations became increasingly acrimonious. Peter III grew concerned for the business and sold his holdings (1/3 share of the Hopewell Forges and 1/6 share of the rest) to a family friend, Robert Coleman, on September 26, 1785, for 8,500 pounds of gold. All of this weighed heavily on Peter Jr., who had gone deeply into debt to build his furnace; the pressures of competing family operations, and his own poor health, led him to take his own life at Hopewell on January 17, 1786.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

After Curtis' subsequent passing in 1789, none of his heirs were willing or able to manage the operations and there were complex family inheritance and legal issues still to be resolved by the courts. [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]] had worked for the brothers and was in a position to step in as the family became increasingly unable to manage the business. As a result, in 1895 Curtis' remaining heirs sold their 3/6 interest to Coleman, and by 1803 he had acquired the Hopewell Forges and 5/6 of the rest of the original properties. A successful [[ironmaster]] and businessman in his own right, Coleman took over the Cornwall operations, acquired other properties, and went on to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

It was fortunate for Peter Jr.'s heirs that he decided to begin iron-making operations at Mount Hope. Since the Colemans were now operating out of Cornwall, Mount Hope was destined to become the headquarters of a new and much larger Grubb family iron business.

Mount Hope Estate was the headquarters of the Grubb Family iron manufacturing operations during the 19th Century.

=== The Rebirth (3rd generation, 1800–30) ===

[[Henry Bates Grubb]], building on his father's legacy, founded the 19th-century Grubb family iron empire.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Henry was the youngest of Peter Jr.'s two sons who inherited their father's estate in 1786, well before they came of age.  The estate included 3,741 acres of iron-rich Cornwall land, 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus 221 acres and their father's new furnace at Mount Hope. Henry, unlike his older brother Alan, was quite interested in the iron business and had several competent advisers whom the brothers had selected as guardians of their estate. He purchased his brother's share in 1798, to be paid over time, and began to rebuild the business, apparently with the cooperation of Robert Coleman. Henry was barely seventeen when he began a series of transactions to rebuild the family iron business, acquiring several properties. The combined operations grew to become one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the 19th century.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

:*In 1798 Henry purchased his brother Alan's share of the inheritance, to be paid over time. Shortly thereafter he financed his rebuilding plans with the sale of a half interest in his properties to Robert Coleman.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*In 1800 Henry built the Mount Vernon Furnace at [[Conewago Creek (east)|Conewago Creek]], on 4,000 acres in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt; He also purchased the Hellam Iron Works in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]] and renamed it the [[Codorus Township, Pennsylvania|Codorus]] Forge.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = indiansteps&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Ruins of Codorus Furnace &amp; Forge | publisher = Indian Steps Museum  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.indiansteps.org/07-near.html | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In 1802, Henry agreed to the partition of the common holdings between himself and Coleman, in order to obtain additional funds to pay off his brother. Coleman received Henry's interest in the Hopewell Forges and another 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore banks, while Henry retained a 1/6 interest in the ore banks to supply his Mount Hope furnace which he now fully owned.&lt;ref name=dibert /&gt;

:*In 1803 Henry purchased 2,500 acres on [[Manada Creek]] in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] on which his sons later built a furnace.&lt;ref name=forgesfurnaces /&gt;

:*In 1800 - 1805, Henry built the 12 room formal Federal-style mansion at [[Mount Hope Estate]], including the extensive formal gardens. Mount Hope Estate was the headquarters of the new Grubb family iron empire and at one time comprised nearly 30 structures surrounded by a wall, all constructed of locally quarried red sandstone.&lt;ref name="NHRP nom" /&gt;

Henry's holdings grew to include at least three iron manufacturing operations, over 6,500 acres of land and a 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore banks, all managed from Mount Hope. He died in 1823, leaving his widow Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb to oversee the operations until their sons began to come of age in 1830.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== The peak production years (4th generation, 1840–75) ===

Henry's three sons ([[Edward Burd Grubb, Sr.|Edward Burd Grubb]], [[Clement Brooke Grubb]] and Alfred Bates Grubb) took over the family business when they came of age beginning in 1830. They greatly expanded the family's operations to become Pennsylvania's leading iron producers from 1840 to 1870, with their headquarters at [[Mount Hope Estate]].&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHRP nom" /&gt;

Edward was sent to Europe in 1830 to study the latest iron technology, apparently a worthwhile family investment in the future growth of the business. In 1833 Edward and Clement assumed control of the business under the name E. &amp; C.B. Alfred's involvement probably began when he came of age in 1839.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Clement apparently decided to strike out on his own, as he resigned from E. &amp; C.B in 1845 and sold his half interest in the Mount Hope Estate to his younger brother Alfred for $25,000. He moved to Lancaster, where he built a large Greek Revival mansion that is now the Lancaster Museum of Art. About the same time Edward removed with his family to [[Burlington, NJ]], where he became a prominent citizen of that area.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Alfred was left to manage the Mount Hope Estate and Furnace, in partnership with Edward and his heirs, which he continued until at least 1873. After his death in 1885, the Mount Hope Estate was sold back to Clement for $300,000.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = hopesale /&gt;

Clement acquired several operations at other locations, including two newer-technology [[Anthracite iron|anthracite furnaces]] near [[Columbia, PA]], along the [[Susquehanna River]].

=== The post-Civil War years (5th generation, 1870–1900) ===

Grubb family members owned and/or operated eleven iron manufacturing operations after the Civil War, when iron was in great demand to meet the needs of an expanding country. Old plants were acquired or upgraded and a new one was built. The Cornwall ore banks continued to supply large quantities of ore to both the iron and newer steel industries. But the expansion of ironworks proved to be short-lived, as the transition to steel production was on the horizon.

:*The Codorus Iron Mine (Grubb's Bank) was mined from 1866 to 1874 under C. B. Grubb and Son.

:*The Manada Furnace (charcoal) continued in production under the Grubb family until 1875.

:*The Mount Hope Furnace (charcoal) continued in production under Alfred Bates Grubb until his death in 1885.

:*The Conewago Furnace (anthracite) was upgraded in 1879 and continued in production under the Conewago Iron Company until 1888.

:*The two St. Charles Furnaces (anthracite), one acquired in 1875, continued in production under C.B. Grubb &amp; Son until 1886 &amp; 1889.

:*The Joanna Furnace (charcoal) was technologically upgraded in 1889 and continued in production under Clement's son-in-law L. Heber Smith until his death in 1898.

:*The two Chickies Furnaces (anthracite), acquired in 1868 and 1888, continued in production under Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Company until 1899.

:*The Chestnut Hill Ore Bank continued to be mined under Charles Brooke Grubb until 1907.

:*The Lebanon Valley Furnace (anthracite &amp; coke), built in 1867, continued in production under Gen. E. Burd Grubb, who probably retired in 1911.

=== End of a dynasty (1898–1911) ===

The charcoal- and anthracite-based iron manufacturing business rather quickly succumbed to newer technology and the transition to the steel industry that located further west. The ten Grubb family furnaces and mines listed above were shut down over just a 25-year period. Daisy Grubb sold some of her inherited industrial holdings and C. Ross Grubb, as President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, sold the Cornwall Iron Mines, both in 1902, to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (later acquired by Bethlehem Steel Company in February, 1916).&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = pasteelco&gt;{{Cite web| title = Family of Henry Bates Grubb | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~duffy/reports/grubb/rr01_031.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; E. Burd Grubb continued to operate  the Lebanon Valley Furnace until about 1911.&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley/&gt; The dispositions of the other Grubb properties have not been determined, but may have also been acquired by Pennsylvania Steel.

The final fifth-generation members of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty generally went into well-funded retirements. Of Clement's heirs, Charles Brooke Grubb died a batchelor at his Lancaster home in 1911; Ella Jane (Grubb) Smith died in 1920; Daisy Grubb renovated the Mount Hope Estate and may have died there in 1936.  Of Edward Burd Grubb's heirs, Gen. E. Burd Grubb ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1908, lost his fortune in a bad investment, and died in Newark in 1913; Henry Bates Grubb died in Burlington in 1919; C. Ross Grubb owned a chateau in Normandy, a villa on the Riviera, and an estate at Manada where he died in 1928. Sixth-generation Parker Ross Grubb died at 45 while golfing in Switzerland in 1920.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

The Cornwall Iron Mines, that had been the source of the family's wealth, continued in production under Bethlehem Steel until operations were ended by a 1973 flood resulting from
[[Hurricane Agnes]]; it had been mined continuously for 234 years.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

== The Daisy Grubb era (1890–1936) ==

Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb was Clement Grubb's youngest child. Never married, she inherited holdings worth $6 million from her father in 1889 and became a wealthy Lancaster [[spinster]] and [[socialite]] who lived at [[Mount Hope Estate]] and at her father's mansion in downtown Lancaster; she also had a town home in Philadelphia. In 1902, she sold most of her inherited industrial holdings to Pennsylvania Steel Company.&lt;ref name = pasteelco /&gt; In 1895, she began renovating her 12-room Federal-style Mount Hope mansion, enlarging it into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained extensively. She retained the formal gardens established by her grandfather. Grubb was the last family member to live at Mount Hope, where she may have died in 1936. The estate is now privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Her will left a trust fund to the Hope Episcopal Church, which was built by her grandmother, and the rest to descendants of her sisters.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NHRP nom" /&gt;

== Properties and companies ==

The following properties were owned and operated over time by members of the Grubb family, or were closely associated with their operations. Presented in the approximate order of their appearance in the family dynasty. The early furnaces were charcoal-fired, and so were located on or near large tracts of hardwood forests that supplied the charcoal. Later furnaces (after about 1845) were fired by anthracite coal and/or coke, and were located near waterways or railroads that could transport the coal-based fuel mined elsewhere. Forges transformed the pig iron, produced by the furnaces, into final products.

=== Cornwall Iron Mines ===

The [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Iron Mines]] in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], also known as the Cornwall Ore Banks, were the foundation of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty. Discovered by [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]], who had acquired 1,000 acres by 1737, they proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of Lake Superior, and were once the largest open pit iron mine in the world. The ore was primarily [[magnetite]]. While the majority interest in the mines were gradually acquired by [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]] by 1803, the descendants of [[Peter Grubb, Jr.]] retained a 1/6 interest as tenants in common.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

The Cornwall Ore Bank Company was formed in 1864 to operate the mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96!  The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was later acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]]) in February, 1916.&lt;ref name = orebankcompany&gt;{{cite book | title = Notes on Cornwall Ore Bank Company | publisher = Lebanon County Historical Society Deposit of Manuscript Collections  | url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/Bah/DAM/mg/mg182.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an open pit mine sold to Bethlehem Steel by the Coleman heirs in 1919.

The mines produced high quality iron ore and other valuable minerals for 234 years, growing to over a million tons per year, until they were flooded by [[Hurricane Agnes]] and then closed permanently in 1973.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

Acreage = 1,000 acres in 1737. 10,261 acres in 1786 (6,520 owned by Curtis Grubb &amp; Robert Coleman, 3,741 by Peter Grubb, Jr.'s heirs)

=== Cornwall Furnace ===

The [[Cornwall Furnace]] in Lebanon County was built by Peter Grubb in 1742 to process ore from his nearby Cornwall Iron Mines and supply pig iron to his Hopewell Forges. A cold blast charcoal fired furnace, it had a reported output capacity of 32 tons per week and supplied pig iron to six local and Philadelphia forges. After Cury &amp; Co.'s 20-year lease expired about 1765, the furnace was jointly owned by Peter's sons [[Curtis Grubb|Curtis]] and [[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Jr.]] Curtis, the majority partner, operated the furnace and Peter ran the Hopewell Forges. The brothers were enthusiastic [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] and their iron works supplied cannon and other munitions to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] effort during their ownership, which ended with Curtis' death in 1789.

Curtis Grubb's heirs found themselves unable or unwilling to operate the business and in 1795 they sold their interests to Robert Coleman, who had already acquired a partial interest in the business and had been managing it for them. Coleman and his heirs operated Cornwall Furnace, with various improvements over the years, until it was closed down in 1883. It has been preserved in excellent condition and the property was deeded to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1932 by the Coleman heirs. Cornwall Furnace is now open to the public and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== Hopewell Forges ===

The [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] on Hammer Creek (not to be confused with the [[Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site]]), were part of the original Grubb iron works, built by Peter Grubb (the elder) in 1742 to turn pig iron from Cornwall Furnace into final iron products. After 1765, Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. assumed joint ownership of their father's holdings, including the forges. Peter Jr., the minority partner, lived nearby and operated the forges until his death in 1786. See {{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Hopewell Forge Mansion &amp; Historic Marker | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM7GCF_Hopewell_Forge_Mansion | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}

The forges, however, became central to a Grubb family tragedy and other unintended consequences. In 1783, Curtis' son Peter III had been given an interest in the family iron works by his father as an advance inheritance. The courts then had to determine how best to partition the overall assets. Peter III was given a 1/6 interest in the ore fields and a 1/3 interest in the forges, making him partners with his uncle Peter. Neither were happy with the arrangement and in 1785 Peter III sold his share of the forges (and the ore fields) to Robert Coleman, who thus became Peter Jr.'s partner. Peter Jr. became even more concerned for his business situation, especially for the supply of pig iron from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, and decided to build his own furnace at Mount Hope. He went deeply into debt and the pressures of the situation led him to commit suicide at Hopewell in 1786.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

These events related to the forges had another unintended consequence. As part of the sale to Coleman, Peter III reserved for himself and his heirs the perpetual right to remove sufficient ore from Cornwall Iron Mines to supply one furnace. This clause, particularly the definition of "one furnace," became an unsettled issue in the courts for nearly 100 years. See "Robesonia Iron Company" below.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

Coleman acquired the remaining interest in the Hopewell Forges in 1802, from Henry Bates Grubb. The property was among those left by Coleman to his four sons upon his death in 1825. While it is unclear when Hopewell ceased operations, it produced 250 tons in 1833,&lt;ref name = mombert&gt;{{cite book | title = An Authentic History of Lancaster County: in the State of Pennsylvania | author = J.

There is little left of the forges today except a few remnants of the dams at the creek, but Peter Grubb's mansion and historic marker can still be seen on present-day Route 322.

=== Union Forge ===

Union Forge was constructed by Curtis Grubb about 1782, near present-day Jonestown, PA, about 12 miles north of Cornwall Furnace. Curtis built the forge to process pig iron from Cornwall Furnace. Included were 1,000 acres of land, blacksmith and carpenter shops, a grist mill, and several houses. The forge continued in operation, under various owners, until 1868, when rolling mills had begun to displace forges as refiners of iron. Union Forge was initially held in common with the rest of the ironworks, and was included in the 1786 partition of the Grubb properties. While unclear, it probably remained a Curtis Grubb operation until his heirs sold to Robert Coleman in 1895.&lt;ref name = unionforge&gt;{{cite book| title = The Law of Mines and Mining in the United States | author = Daniel M.

=== Mount Hope Furnace ===

The charcoal-fired Mount Hope Furnace was built in 1785 by Peter Grubb, Jr., on 212 acres of land he purchased from Jacob Graybill in 1784, in [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]] about five miles north of Lancaster. There was already an operating [[gristmill]] on the property. Peter went deeply into debt to build the furnace because he feared for the future supply of pig iron for his Hopewell Forges from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, in which Peter had only a minority interest. Peter yielded to the business pressures he found himself under and took his own life at Hopewell in 1786. His sons Alan Burd Grubb and [[Henry Bates Grubb]] inherited the furnace, which became a core asset of the future Grubb iron business.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt; The furnace produced 1,000 tons of pig iron in 1833.&lt;ref name = mombert /&gt; The furnace was upgraded to [[hot blast]] and apparently continued in operation until at least 1885, when it was sold by Alfred Bates Grubb's estate, along with nearly 2,500 acres of land (the Mount Hope Estate), back to his brother Clement Brooke Grubb (who had sold his share to Alfred in 1845) for $300,000.&lt;ref name = hopesale&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/05/29/103020567.pdf |format=PDF |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1885-05-29 |title=An Iron Furnace Sold.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount Hope Estate ===

The [[Mount Hope Estate]] was the enclave near Manheim that was home and headquarters of the Grubb family iron enterprises after 1800. It grew from Peter Grubb Jr.'s original 212 acres in 1786, home to the Mount Hope Furnace and gristmill, to over 2,500 acres and many buildings by 1885. The original Federal style mansion was built by Peter's son, Henry Bates Grubb, between 1800 and 1805; it was the most formal ironmaster's mansion in the area up to 1850, and featured formal gardens that are still maintained. The enclave at its peak contained nearly 30 outbuildings (including the Hope Church, built in 1848-9), most constructed of locally quarried red sandstone and enclosed by a wall of the same material.

Henry B. Grubb, who had inherited Mount Hope from his father at age 12, passed it on to his two older sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, upon his death in 1823.  The Estate was managed by Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, until the sons came of age. The brothers partnered to operate the business in 1833, under the name E. &amp; C.B. In 1845 Clement sold his half interest to their younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb for $25,000. After Alfred's death in 1885, his heirs sold Mount Hope Estate back to Clement for $300,000, in the most expensive real estate transaction in Lancaster up to that time.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = hopesale /&gt;

The last family member to live at Mount Hope was Clement's daughter Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb, who inherited it from her father along with holdings worth six million dollars. In 1895 she began an extensive renovation and transformed the original 12-room structure into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained many distinguished guests. Daisy lived at Mount Hope at least part of the time until she died in 1936.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

The property was subdivided and mostly sold off by the subsequent owners, but the mansion and some surrounding land was bought by Charles Romito for a winery in 1980 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

=== Mount Vernon Furnaces and Forge ===

The Mount Vernon Furnace was the first furnace built by [[Henry Bates Grubb]], in 1800 by most references. A charcoal-fired furnace, it was located near Elizabethtown on Conewago Creek, about 15 miles southwest of Mount Hope.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = swank&gt;{{cite book | title = History of the Manufacture of Iron in All Ages | author = James Moore Swank | year = 1892 | location = Leland Stanford Jr. University Library | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nuwJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=mount+vernon+furnace+grubb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yunxq6a82R&amp;sig=adS7rGftnzUqflLKTepMao7gT4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rqL_TP_uBJPksQOF4OivCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=mount%20vernon%20furnace%20grubb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced 50 tons of pig iron per week (2,500 tons per year) from Cornwall ore.&lt;ref name = mtvernon2&gt;{{cite book | title = Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania | author = John F.

After Henry's death in 1823, the operations were continued by his sons Edward Burd Grubb and Charles Bates Grubb, and Edward built a second furnace by the same name in 1831.&lt;ref name = swank /&gt; The iron furnaces fell out of production and were abandoned in 1852.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

The sawmill is still in operation today and the gristmill carried on until 1913. The gristmill was still owned by Grubb &amp; Company in 1875. Its ruins can be seen on the property of the beautiful and historic Conewago Manor Inn and the sawmill can be seen nearby. The original inn was built by Samuel Smith sometime after 1739; Henry Bates Grubb added the majestic stonework structure in 1811 and named it Mount Vernon Estate.&lt;ref name = conewagomanor&gt;{{cite book | title = Mount Vernon Estate (Conewago Manor Inn) and Grist Mill Ruins | url = http://www.millpictures.com/mills/details.cfm?millid=1141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grubb's Mount Vernon Furnace is not to be confused with the similarly named furnace in Fayette County in western Pennsylvania.

=== Codorus Forge and Furnace ===

The Codorus Forge was the new name given to the Hellam Forge that Henry Bates Grubb bought from Thomas Neill in 1802. The forge was located in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], near the intersection of [[Codorus Creek]] with the [[Susquehanna River]], about 30 miles southwest of Mount Hope.

The forge, which had passed through several owners, was originally built around 1765 by William Bennett on 150 acres obtained from William Penn. The forge processed pig iron produced at nearby Mary Ann Furnace, and had supplied cannon and shot to the [[Continental Army]], probably under the ownership of James Smith, a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name = indiansteps /&gt;

Henry Grubb operated the forge until he hired John Shippen, who managed it from 1818 until 1825. Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, oversaw its operation until their oldest sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, came of age. The sons inherited the forge and began operating it in 1833 under their partnership E. &amp; C.B. They added the {{Cite web | title = Codorus Furnace | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/khonsus/4412204146/}} about 1837, transporting ore from their Chestnut Hills Mines by flat boat across the Susquehanna River. The iron products were shipped downriver to Philadelphia and Baltimore. The furnace and forge were closed sometime in the 1850s.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

An iron ore deposit, known as Grubb's Bank (see below), was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866, well after the forge and furnace were closed down. The ore was shipped by river to the St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.

=== Manada Furnace ===

In 1803 Henry Bates Grubb purchased land from Gen. Timothy Green, on [[Manada Creek]] in the northwest part of East Hanover Township in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]], about 60 miles east of Mount Hope.  Manada Furnace was built in 1836 by Henry's sons Clement B. &amp; Edward B. Grubb, at Sand Beach near the site of the old [[Manada Gap, Pennsylvania|Manada Fort]]. Embracing some 2,500 acres, Manada Furnace was the only charcoal furnace in Dauphin County in 1856, a year after the brothers' partnership ended.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

The ore came from the Grubb's Chestnut Hill mine or from the Cornwall mines via the Union Canal to Lebanon. From there it was brought by wagon to the furnace. Water power from Manada Creek turned a wheel which operated the bellows that pumped air into the furnace. The water wheel was probably on the northeast corner of the furnace.  A bridge from a hill led to the top of the furnace. Men dumped wheelbarrow loads of charcoal, limestone and iron ore into the top. The furnace produced pig iron and also did some casting of products. From 1837 to 1848 the furnace produced over 22,000 tons of iron. The metal was sent to the Swatara railroad station for transport.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = indiantown&gt;{{cite book | title = Manada Furnace-Preliminary Report Fort Indiantown Gap Youth Conservation Corps | date =  August 18, 1979 | url = http://www.wwiifederation.org/igmr_history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community surrounding the furnace consisted of a general store, the iron master's house, a smoke house, boarding house, and twenty two log cabins. The church is still in existence as the United Christian Episcopal Manada Furnace Church. At the peak of operations, the furnace employed 75 men.  Two hundred acres were used for farming for the families of furnace workers. In September 1861 the furnace workers formed the 46th Regiment, D Company to fight in the Civil War. The company was disbanded on July 16, 1865.&lt;ref name = indiantown /&gt; During the Civil War, the owners of Manada Furnace were able to use Confederate prisoners from [[Camp Curtin]] to work as woodcutters and laborers. Many are buried at {{Cite web | title = Manada Confederate Graveyard | url = http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc2/manadagap1.htm}}

=== E. &amp; C.B. ===

A partnership formed in 1833 by Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb to run the family business from Mount Hope Estate. The partnership continued until 1845 when Clement sold his share to his younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb. By then, Edward had removed to Burlington, NJ and Clement to Lancaster, PA. The companies and properties listed below involved only Clement and Edward and their heirs, as Alfred's did not join the family iron business.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== E.B &amp; A.B Grubb Company ===

A partnership formed in 1845 between Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and Alfred Bates Grubb to manage Mt. Hope Estate and Furnace after their brother Clement ended his partnership with Edward.  After Edward's death in 1867, Alfred carried on, with Edward's heirs, until 1873.&lt;ref name = pareports /&gt;

=== Chestnut Hill Ore Bank ===

The Chestnut Hill Ore Bank, acquired by Clement Brooke Grubb by 1851, was about eight miles west of Lancaster, at Silver Spring near [[Columbia, Pennsylvania|Columbia]]. The several ore properties at Chestnut Hill, which adjoin each other, were, when taken as a whole, one of the largest [[hematite]] ore deposits in Pennsylvania. Ore was first discovered on the Greider farm, between 1825 and 1832, by the engineer Simeon Guilford. Most of the furnaces in and around Columbia and Chickies depended on these mines for their principal supply of ore.&lt;ref name = chestnut1&gt;{{cite book | title = Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society, Volume I | year = 1897 | url = https://archive.org/stream/georgerossmemori01lancrich/georgerossmemori01lancrich_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grubb tract, about 13 acres, was developed by Jerome Boyer around 1839 and acquired and further developed by Clement Brooke Grubb sometime prior to 1851, when the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company was incorporated.&lt;ref name = lakegrubb /&gt;  Various tracts at Chestnut Hill were owned, in 1869, by Clement Brooke Grubb, heirs of his brother [[Edward Burd Grubb, Sr.]], the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company, the Silver Spring Iron Ore Company, and other owners of small outcroppings.&lt;ref name = mombert /&gt; In 1904, the property was owned by Clement's son, Charles Brooke Grubb. The ore bank supplied thousands of tons of iron ore to the Grubb's Codorus and Manada furnaces and to other nearby anthracite furnaces, such as the St. Charles Furnaces, until 1907.&lt;ref name = chestnut2 /&gt;

The ore pit, about 13 acres and 110 feet deep, has since filled with water, creating {{Cite web | title = Lake Grubb | url = http://lancasterrealtycheck.com/post/118864/lake-grubb-nature-park-walking-trail }}, part of a modern-day 54 acre recreational area in [[Silver Spring, Pennsylvania]].

=== Columbia Furnace ===

The Grubb Family Papers, 1814–1869, mention a Columbia Furnace 1853 - 1860.&lt;ref name = papers&gt;{{cite book | title = Grubb Family Papers, 1814 - 1869 |location = Historical Society of Pennsylvania | url = http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/0200.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These sources have not been reviewed and no other references to a furnace by that name have been found. They likely relate to the Grubb-owned St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.

=== St. Charles Furnace #1 ===

Clement Brooke Grubb built the {{Cite web | title = St. Charles Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/StCharles.htm}} in 1854, at Columbia near the Susquehanna River about 12 miles west of Lancaster, on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Years later, in 1875, Grubb and his son Charles bought the Henry Clay Furnace, about a mile upriver, and renamed it St. Charles No. 2. Both furnaces were fired by anthracite coal. Together, these two furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron, which was well known for its quality for boiler plate, bars, nails and foundry work. In 1863 Grubb built a large iron ore roaster, the first of its kind in Lancaster County, to remove sulfur from the local ores used in the furnaces. The St Charles Furnace was remodeled in 1879–80, but only six years later in 1886 it went out of blast for the last time. It was dismantled in 1897; some remains can be seen from the Route 30 bridge.&lt;ref name = rivertownes /&gt;&lt;ref name = stcharles1 /&gt;

=== C.B Grubb and Son ===

C.B. Grubb and Son was a partnership formed about 1872 between Clement Brooke Grubb and his son Charles Brooke Grubb. It presumably endured until Clement's death in 1889.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt; The partnership owned both St. Charles Furnaces&lt;ref name = henryclay /&gt;&lt;ref name = stcharles1 /&gt; and the Codorus Iron Mine, also known as Grubb's Bank.&lt;ref name = codorusore /&gt; They likely also had an interest in the Chestnut Hill Ore Banks, since they were owned by Charles in 1904.

=== Henry Clay Furnace (St. Charles Furnace #2) ===

In 1875 C.B. Grubb and Son (Clement and Charles) bought the {{Cite web | title = Henry Clay Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/HenryClay.htm}}, located about a mile up the Susquehanna River from Clement's St. Charles Furnace, on the Pennsylvania Canal and the Pennsylvania Railroad. They renamed it St. Charles No. 2.

The Henry Clay furnace was one of the first of the anthracite-fired furnaces along the Susquehanna between Columbia and Marietta. It was built in 1845 by Peter Haldeman, but changed hands several times after 1855, producing only sporadically until 1865 when, after a long period of idleness it was blown in again under the proprietorship of the firm Denney and Hess.  In 1875 Clement and Charles purchased and renamed it St. Charles Furnace No. 2. Together, the two St. Charles furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron. The furnace was remodeled in 1879, 1880 and again in 1887, but its production declined and it was abandoned in 1889. Ruins of the onsite tenement building can still be seen today.&lt;ref name = henryclay /&gt;

=== Codorus Iron Mine (Grubb's Bank) ===

The Codorus Iron Mine, better known in later years as Grubb's Bank, was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866. The owner in 1874 was C. B. Grubb and Son. Since the Codorus Furnace was by then shut down, the ore was hauled to the Susquehanna River and floated to the St. Charles Furnaces in Columbia. The mine, less than an acre in size, contained ore consisting of a mixture of magnetite and hematite in sandstone. About 25,000 tons were removed by 1874, with seven men typically working to take about 25 tons per day.&lt;ref name = codorusore /&gt;

=== The Grubb &amp; Haldeman companies ===

The Haldeman family were prominent iron manufacturers in the Chickies area in Lancaster County. The Grubbs and Haldemans formed several business relationships, beginning in 1869, to own and operate three anthracite furnaces.

In 1869, heirs of Edward B. Grubb Sr. joined the firm of E. Haldeman &amp; Company, after its founder retired. Those heirs apparently were Henry Bates Grubb and his brother C. Ross Grubb, both of whom became officers in other Grubb/Haldeman companies. C. Ross Grubb had purchased the Eagle Furnace, and the Chickies Iron Company was formed in 1876.&lt;ref name = grubbhaldeman /&gt;

By 1882, Paris Haldeman, Henry Bates Grubb, and Horace Haldeman had formed the Conewago Iron Company, owners of the Conewago Furnace in Dauphin County. This relationship continued until at least 1892, by which time C. Ross Grubb had succeeded Paris Haldeman as President. The furnace under their ownership supplied the Chickies Iron Company exclusively, but went out of blast in 1888.&lt;ref name = conewago1 /&gt;&lt;ref name = conewagofurnace /&gt;

In 1888, the firm of Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Company was formed as a partnership, between Paris Haldeman, C. Ross Grubb, and Horace L. Haldeman.  Horace was the managing partner, and Paris retired in 1891. The firm owned Chickies Furnace #1 (formerly the Chickies Furnace, that had been built and owned by the Haldemans) and Chickies Furnace #2 (previously the Eagle Furnace, that had been acquired by Grubb in 1869).

=== Eagle Furnace (Chickies Furnace #2) ===

The anthracite-fired {{Cite web | title = Eagle Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies2.htm}} (later renamed Chickies Furnace #2), was built in 1854 on the floodplain between Marietta and Columbia just north of Chickies Creek by Stephen Eagle. Eagle operated the furnace until 1869, when it was purchased by C. Ross Grubb, son and heir of Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and brother of E. Burd Grubb, Jr. He later became associated with E. Haldeman and Company, who owned and operated the Chickies Furnace. The Haldeman company managed the furnace, remodeled it several times and changed the name to Chickies #2. Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Co. was formed in 1888 to take ownership of Chickies #2 and the nearby Chickies #1. The principal ores used at both Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County. In the late 1880s the furnace was extensively rebuilt, a two-story engine house was added, and the furnace operated successfully until it was shut down in 1899. Remnants of the furnace, including the still-occupied engine house, can be seen today.&lt;ref name = chickies2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = chickies2again /&gt;

=== Conewago Furnace ===

The Conewago Furnace, formerly the Middletown Furnace, was in Middletown, Dauphin County. The furnace, built in 1853 and rebuilt in 1879, was owned in 1882 by the Conewago Iron Company, a Grubb and Haldeman partnership. Paris Haldeman was President, Henry Bates Grubb was Vice-President, and Horace Haldeman was Treasurer.  It was fueled by anthracite and coke, and the ores were from Cornwall and Chestnut Hill. The product was "Chickies" pig iron, made exclusively by contract for the Chickies Iron Company. The Conewago Furnace went out of blast in 1888.&lt;ref name = conewagofurnace /&gt;

Henry Haldeman built the first {{Cite web | title = Chickies Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies1.htm}} near the base of Chickies Rock, in Lancaster County, in 1845. Haldeman's sons Edwin and Samuel took over his business holdings later that same year and brought the anthracite-fired furnace into blast in 1846. The furnace was rarely out of blast and with several remodellings to implement technological advancements, it produced 17,000 tons of pig iron per year by the late 19th century.  In 1888, Paris and Horace Haldeman partnered with C. Ross Grubb, who owned the nearby Eagle Furnace, to form Haldeman, Grubb and Company. They renamed the furnace Chickies #1 and renamed Eagle Furnace Chickies #2; operating both furnaces until they were shut down in 1899. The principal ores used at the Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County.&lt;ref name = chickies1&gt;{{cite book| title = Chickies Furnace #1 | author = Rivertownes PA USA | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burd Grubb had become the owner when his father died, shortly before the furnace was blown for the first time in 1867.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt; The furnace was a modern anthracite- and coke-fired furnace that was remodeled in 1884 and rebuilt in 1904, producing an output of pig iron, under the "Lebanon Valley" brand, of 24,000 tons per year. It was still active in 1907&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley /&gt; and most likely continued under Grubb's control until 1911.

Lifespan = 1867-unk; 1867 – c. 1911, 44 years in Grubb family&lt;br /&gt;
Furnace type = Anthracite and coke, hot blast&lt;br /&gt;
Ore source = Cornwall Iron Mines&lt;br /&gt;
Production = Estimated 24,000 ton/year&lt;br /&gt;
Acreage = N/A&lt;br /&gt;
Transportation = Probably rail

=== Cornwall Ore Bank Company ===

The Grubbs were minority partners in the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, as they continued to hold a 1/6 interest in the ore banks. The company was formed in 1864 to operate the Cornwall mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96 tenants in common!  The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was itself acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] in February, 1916.&lt;ref name = orebankcompany/&gt; The President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company when the mines were sold was C. Ross Grubb, representing the Grubb family's fifth generation in the iron business.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== Joanna Furnace ===
{{Main article|Joanna Furnace Complex}}

While not formally a Grubb property, the charcoal-fired {{Cite web | title = Joanna Furnace | url = http://www.haycreek.org/joanna_furnace.htm}} was owned by Clement Grubb's son-in-law, L. Heber Smith, a Civil War Colonel who married Clement's daughter Ella Jane Brooke Grubb in 1868. Located in Berks County, the furnace was built in 1792 and named for Joanna Potts, wife of the principal owner. It passed through several hands before Smith took ownership, probably after the war and before his marriage to Ella Jane. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Grubbs assisted with the furnace's major technological upgrade in 1889, especially since Ella Jane would have been an heiress to her father's sizable estate that year. The furnace continued in operation under Smith until it was "blown out" after his death in 1898 at the age of 61. The furnace was acquired by Bethlehem Steel, who deeded it to the Hay Creek Valley Historical Association in 1979; the ruins have been enhanced by local historians and are open to visitors.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = joanna&gt;{{cite book| title = Joanna Furnace | author = Hay Creek Valley Historical Assn. | url = http://www.haycreek.org/joanna_furnace.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifespan = 1792–1898, 106 years; 1868–1898, 30 years in Smith/Grubb family&lt;br /&gt;
Furnace type = Charcoal cold blast&lt;br /&gt;
Ore source = Jones Mine&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Production = Not determined&lt;br /&gt;
Acreage = Not determined

=== Robesonia Iron Company ===

While the Robesonia Iron Company, owners of the {{Cite web | title = Robesonia Furnace | url = http://www.robesoniafurnace.org/}} at [[Robesonia, Pennsylvania|Robesonia]] in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] about 20 miles east of Cornwall, was not a Grubb property, it affected the affairs of the Grubbs and Colemans for most of the 19th century because it owned access rights to Cornwall iron ore.

After Curtis Grubb's oldest son Peter Grubb III received his inheritance in 1783, he sold his 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges to Robert Coleman. But as a condition of that sale Peter reserved for himself and his heirs the right of access to remove "for as long as grass grows and water flows" sufficient ore to supply "one furnace". Peter later, in 1883, sold his remaining share of the iron mines, along with these rights, to [[George Ege]] to supply his Reading Furnace in Berks County.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = Robesonia&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Friends of the Robesonia Furnace, Inc. | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.robesoniafurnace.org | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry P. Robeson]] acquired the operation in 1845 and with it the right to access Cornwall iron ore. Robeson replaced the charcoal-fired Reading Furnace with two (in 1848 and 1855) more modern and much larger Robesonia [[Anthracite iron|Anthracite Furnaces]], while still demanding the right to access Cornwall iron ore – to supply one furnace, whichever one of the two was in operation, but not both at once. The combined capacity was many times greater than had been visualized in 1783. That right of access, especially with the interpretation of the quantities of ore permitted for "one furnace", was a highly contentious issue for years between Robeson and the Grubbs and Colemans, who jointly owned the ore banks as tenants in common. The issue languished in the courts for years and was not resolved until the state Supreme Court ruled in Robesonia's favor in 1880. As a result, in 1884, the company decided to market only one kind of pig iron called "Robesonia", made exclusively from Cornwall ore, which was consumed in large quantities.&lt;ref name = Robesonia /&gt;&lt;ref name = court&gt;{{cite book | title = Weekly notes, Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Volume 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3wgVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA444&amp;lpg=PA444&amp;dq=grubb+iron+furnace+pennsylvania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dl1YHDoUiM&amp;sig=u-OJLnWiV_7nP1DPfJSJeV8MBLc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wiPgTO-LEYKmsQOp5o3rCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=grubb%20iron%20furnace%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the Bethlehem Steel Company, owners of the Cornwall iron mines since 1916, acquired Robesonia. In order to protect the mines from the enormous amounts of ore being consumed, Bethlehem Steel elected to shut down the Robesonia furnaces in 1927.&lt;ref name = Robesonia /&gt;

Lifespan = 1848–1927, 79 years (anthracite furnaces)&lt;br /&gt;
Furnace type = Two anthracite hot blast furnaces&lt;br /&gt;
Ore source = Cornwall Iron Mines&lt;br /&gt;
Production = Grew from 52 ton/wk in 1848 to 240 ton/wk in 1854 to 1,000 ton/wk (52,000 ton/yr) in 1884&lt;br /&gt;
Acreage = 6-7,000

She founded and led the [[Best Party]] and [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]].

==Early life and education==
Helgadóttir was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]]. She earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in political science from the [[University of Iceland]].&lt;ref name=Joking&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/joking-seriously|title=Joking Seriously: The Artful Political Science of Besti Flokkurinn: An Interview with the Best Party’s Heiða Kristín Helgadóttir|journal=Meditations: Journal of the Marxist Literary Group|volume=26|date=2012–13|first=Andrew|last=Pendakis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 March 2014 |title=Iceland is on top of the world for women's rights |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/iceland-is-on-top-of-the-world-for-womens-rights-261092.html |work=Irish Examiner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from university, Helgadóttir worked in an [[artificial intelligence]] laboratory. While there her friend Gaukur Úlfarsson introduced her to comedian [[Jón Gnarr]]. Amid the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|Icelandic financial crisis]]  they created the Best Party in 2009 with the original intention to parody political practices in Iceland.&lt;ref name=Joking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Handbook of the World 2015|first=Tom|last=Lansford|year=2015|publisher=CQ Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yNGfBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Helgadóttir ran the Best Party's campaign in Reykjavik's election, resulting in a shock win which made Gnarr mayor of the city. During Gnarr's tenure as Reykjavik mayor, which ended in 2014, Helgadóttir was his close confidante and advisor and served as CEO of the Best Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 June 2010 |title=Icelander's Campaign Is a Joke, Until He’s Elected |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/world/europe/26iceland.html?_r=2 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 October 2011 |title=For a Free-Form Radio Conference, a Kindred Spirit |url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/for-a-free-form-radio-conference-a-kindred-spirit/ |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 23, 2014 |title=Did politics ruin 'the world’s coolest mayor'? |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/06/23/did_politics_ruin_the_worlds_coolest_mayor.html |work=Toronto Star  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 December 2011 |title=Who Else Were You Going to Vote for? |url=http://tyglobalist.org/in-the-magazine/theme/who-else-were-you-going-to-vote-for/ |work=The Yale Globalist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Herbert Samuel Holt''' (February 12, 1856 &amp;ndash; September 29, 1941) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[civil engineer]] who became a businessman,  [[banker]], and [[corporate director]] with a ruthless business reputation. He was President of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power]], and a director of some 250 companies worldwide, with assets valued at around $200 million. On his death, the [[Montreal Gazette]] described him as "the richest man in [[Canada]]", but he was also one of the most reviled. Among his peers in the [[Golden Square Mile]], "everyone respected his business ability, but nobody liked him personally".&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance of Grandeur - The Anglo-Protestant Elite of Montreal, by Margaret Westley (1990), page 202&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was one of the founders of the Town of [[Hampstead, Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Town of Hampstead]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Holt was born at Ballycrystal, near [[Geashill]], [[County Offaly|Co. Offaly]]. He was the second son of William Robert Grattan Holt, of Carberry House, [[Co. Kildare]], inherited in 1742 from his ancestor, Hannah Colley (afterwards Grattan) of Castle Carberry. Holt grew up with his family at another family property, Ballycrystal, a [[Grazing land|grazing farm]] of 291 [[acres]]. In reference to Holt's own ruthless business reputation, it is of interest to note that in a dispute between his father and his uncle, it was said that, "the business affairs of William Holt's family would not stand up to close scrutiny".&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Migration - Patrick O'Sullivan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Holt's elder brother, Thomas Grattan Holt, succeeded to Ballycrystal and Carberry, while Holt studied civil engineering in [[Dublin]]. In 1873, he emigrated to [[Canada]], beginning work as an assistant engineer with the [[Toronto]] Water Works. In the early 1880s, he was employed to survey and construct portions of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies and through the [[Rocky Mountains]], under [[James Ross (Canadian businessman)|James Ross]].

==Career==
Herbert Holt became a pioneer developer of the [[energy]] business in the [[Province of Quebec]] and owned the Montreal Gas Company. In 1901 he merged Montreal Gas with [[Rodolphe Forget|Rodolphe Forget's]] Royal Electric Company to create the [[Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power|Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power Company]]. In 1944, their successful conglomerate was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] by legislation passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly of Quebec]]. It came under the newly created Quebec Hydroelectric Commission, also known as [[Hydro-Québec]]. Holt served as president of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] from 1908 to 1934, and the bank's chairman from 1934 until his death. He was a co-founder of the [[Ritz-Carlton Montreal]], a director of [[Montreal Trust Company]], [[Canada Car and Foundry]] and many other Canadian companies. He was appointed chairman of the [[Federal Plan Commission]] in 1913. In 1915, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George V|King George V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29094 |supp=y |pages=2363–2364  |date=9 March 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Samuel Holt died in 1941 and was interred in the [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] in Montreal. His comparatively modest home on [[Stanley Street (Montreal)|Stanley Street]] in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]] was demolished after his death. Following its formation in 1979, Herbert Holt's significant contribution to the Canadian economy was recognized through his election to the [[Canadian Business Hall of Fame]].

==Reputation==
However, Holt was also one of the richest and most reviled Montrealers of his time. When his death was announced at a [[baseball]] game in 1941, the crowd cheered. To many [[French Canadian]]s, Holt was the epitome of 'les maudits anglais' ('the damned English'). {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Herbert is remembered for being a harsh banker who enjoyed large profits while the common man suffered during the [[great depression]]. In his own words, "If I am rich and powerful, while you are suffering the stranglehold of poverty and the humiliation of social assistance; if I was able, at the peak of the Depression, to make 150% profits each year, it is foolishness on your part, and as for me, it is the fruit of a wise administration."

==Family==
[[File:Send Grove Surrey.JPG|thumb|Send Grove, Holt's home in [[Surrey]]]]
In 1890, Holt married Jessie, the eldest daughter of Andrew Paton (1833-1892) of [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]]. The Holts kept three houses: One at 297 Stanley Street in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]]; another called Ballycrystal House, near [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]]; and a third called [[Send, Surrey|Send Grove]], near [[Woking]] in [[England]]. The Holts were the parents of three sons:

He kept a house in [[Mayfair, London]] and in 1927 he purchased Lackham Manor, [[Wiltshire]], for £78,000. He was [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire]] and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Upton (UK Parliament constituency)|Upton]], [[Essex]].  He married Elizabeth, daughter of George Lighthall Cains of Montreal and his wife Amy, sister of Percy Cowans of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;J. W.

He successfully succeeded his father in many of his business ventures at Montreal. His friend, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], unsuccessfully attempted to purchase him a [[knighthood]].&lt;ref&gt;The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History, And Development - Christopher McCreery (2005), page 26&lt;/ref&gt; Major Andrew Holt died from a heart attack in London, England, on 12 September 1964.
*Major (William) Robert Grattan Holt (1900-1947), named for his paternal grandfather. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].

'''Inn signs''' have a history that extends beyond the [[Middle Ages]], when many houses were identified by a sign, often a [[Heraldry|heraldic charge]], which signified that the premises were under the special care of a [[nobleman]], or a vivid image that impressed itself on the memory. The ruins of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] reveal that most of their street-front shops displayed an identifying sign outside.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Delderfield. ''Introduction to Inn Signs'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] especially, the tradition, by which [[publican]]s were obliged to identify their premises by a sign, dating from the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]],&lt;ref&gt;Delderfield 1969:12.&lt;/ref&gt;is carried on today. A selection of inn signs carved on slabs and rescued after the [[Great Fire of London]] is preserved in the [[Guildhall]].

{{Chinese name|[[Qiū (surname)|Khoo]]}}
[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] '''Khoo Teck Puat''' ({{zh|c=邱德拔|p=Qiū Dé Bá|poj=Khu Tik-pua̍t}}; 13 January 1917 – 21 February 2004) was a banker and hotel owner, who, with an estimated fortune of S$4.3&amp;nbsp;billion, was the wealthiest man in Singapore at one point. He owned the [[Goodwood Group]] of boutique hotels in London and Singapore and was the largest single shareholder of the British bank [[Standard Chartered]]. The bulk of his fortune came from shares in Standard Chartered, which he bought up in the 1980s to help thwart [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]]'s proposed acquisition which many financiers deemed hostile. The [[Goodwood Park Hotel]] in Singapore, built in 1900, is a restored historic landmark.

Around the period of his death in 2004, Khoo was ranked as the 108th richest person in the world by the business magazine ''[[Forbes]]'' .&lt;ref&gt;Forbes.com [https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/10/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=UNBY&amp;datatype=Person World's Richest Person 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Khoo's estate has donated S$80&amp;nbsp;million to [[Duke-NUS Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;DukeMedNews [http://www.dukemednews.org/news/article.php?id=9996  Announces S$80 Million Gift to Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207081210/http://www.dukemednews.org/news/article.php?id=9996 |date=7 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Khoo received his early education in [[Saint Joseph's Institution, Singapore|St Joseph's Institution]] in Singapore in 1930.  He was educated up to standard eight prior to his marriage at the age of 17, and started working in the bank [[Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation]] (OCBC) as an apprentice bank clerk by 1933. While attached with OCBC, Khoo served as the Chairman of [[Central Provident Fund]] (CPF) Board for a year in 1958. His rise in OCBC was rapid and he developed strong ties with [[Tan Chin Tuan]] until they had a difference of opinion which resulted him leaving OCBC in 1959 as the general manager. He argued that OCBC was growing far too slowly and not opening enough branches in the smaller towns in Peninsular Malaya.

==Career==
In 1960, Khoo restarted his career in banking by founding [[Malayan Banking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maybank.com/|publisher=Maybank|title=Maybank|date=October 2009|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now commonly known as [[Maybank]]) with a few partners in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The bank grew rapidly to more than 150 branches within three years.

In 1963, the bank purchased Goodwood Park Hotel in Singapore for S$4.8&amp;nbsp;million.

From 1964 to 1965, Khoo was a senator in the Malaysian parliament.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1455763/Tan-Sri-Khoo-Teck-Puat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Khoo was ousted from Maybank by the Malaysian government under Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]] on the pretext of pumping the bank's money into his own private firm in Singapore.&lt;ref name=infopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoo Teck Puat|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1856_2011-11-16.html|publisher=National Library Board|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Khoo bought over Maybank's Singapore properties, including Goodwood Park Hotel and Central Properties, for S$50&amp;nbsp;million. While bitter with what the Malaysian government did, Khoo retained his Malaysian citizenship.

In 1976, he ceased to be a director of Maybank. Though he had opened the national bank of [[Brunei]] in the 1960s, his search for a legitimate banking vehicle continued.

In 1981, Khoo bought Australia's Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation – parent of the Travelodge chain – using funds from the National Bank of Brunei. He sold it in 1988 as part of his asset liquidation process to make restitution to the Bruneian government.&lt;ref name=infopedia /&gt;

After the death of the former Sultan Omar in 1986, Sultan Hassanal arranged for an investigation into the finances of the National Bank, leading to its closure.&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/11/1078594496940.html?from=storyrhs&lt;/ref&gt; Khoo had allegedly taken unsecured and undocumented loans of more than £300 million from the bank. He was never charged,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; but his son Khoo Ban Hock served two years in prison for his role in the affair.&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"/&gt;

In 1986, an opportunity arose when as a white knight, Khoo made a dramatic acquisition of a 5% stake in the British bank [[Standard Chartered]], being one of three financiers who came to the rescue of Standard Chartered to stave off a hostile takeover by Lloyds Bank. He subsequently grew his stake to almost 15% to become the single largest shareholder.

In 1990, Khoo made a contribution of S$10&amp;nbsp;million to the Singapore government's 25th anniversary charity fund – to help children, the elderly and the disabled.  He was listed as Singapore's richest businessman by the business magazine ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2003.

In 2004, when Khoo died at [[Mount Elizabeth Hospital]] from a heart attack, it emerged that Khoo had owned a larger stake in his listed companies [[Goodwood Park]], [[Hotel Malaysia]] and [[Central Properties]] than was disclosed to the [[Singapore Exchange]]. After an investigation, his daughters Jacqueline and Elizabeth, who were in management positions at the companies, were fined a total of S$500,000.&lt;ref name=infopedia /&gt; Khoo left his Standard Chartered stake, then approximately 11.5%, to his children.

In March 2006, they sold&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-tan-sri-khoo-teck-puat-estate-agrees-to-sell-shares-in-standard-chartered-to-temasek-55545662.html|agency=PR Newswire|title=Stanchart to Temasek|date=March 2006|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it to Singapore's [[Temasek Holdings]].

==Philanthropy==
The present-day [[Khoo Teck Puat Hospital]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoo Teck Puat Hospital|url=http://www.ktph.com.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.''' was a [[bulge bracket]] [[investment bank]] founded in 1867 by [[Abraham Kuhn (banker)|Abraham Kuhn]]&lt;ref name="GeisstLast"&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles R. |last=Geisst |title=The Last Partnerships: Inside the Great Wall Street Money Dynasties |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tE2RMBKGItgC&amp;pg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(1819–1892) and his brother-in-law [[Solomon Loeb]]. Under the leadership of [[Jacob H. Schiff]], Loeb's son-in-law, it grew to be one of the most influential [[investment bank]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financing America's expanding railways and growth companies, including [[Western Union]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], and thereby becoming the principal rival of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]

In the years following Schiff's death in 1920, the firm was led by [[Otto Kahn]] and [[Felix Warburg]], men who had already solidified their roles as Schiff's able successors.  However, the firm's fortunes began to fade following [[World War II]], when it failed to keep pace with a rapidly changing investment banking industry, in which Kuhn, Loeb's old-world, genteel ways, did not seem to fit; the days of the gentleman-banker had passed.

The firm lost its independence in 1977 when it merged with [[Lehman Brothers]], creating [[Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.]]  The combined firm was itself acquired in 1984 by [[American Express]], forming [[Shearson Lehman/American Express]] and with that, the Kuhn, Loeb name was discarded.

==History==
Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. was an [[investment bank]] located in [[New York City]].  It was founded in 1867, by Abraham Kuhn and [[Solomon Loeb]]. Kuhn and Loeb had created a successful merchandising business in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], when they decided to move east, to New York, to take advantage of the country's burgeoning economic expansion.  Company records indicate that by the time Kuhn and Loeb established their partnership, they were able to capitalize it at $500,000 (equivalent of about ${{Inflation|US|0.5|1867|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}).  On January 1, 1875, [[Jacob Schiff]] (1847–1920), Solomon Loeb's son-in-law, joined the firm.  He eventually became its leader and grew the firm into the second most prestigious investment bank in the United States behind [[John Pierpont Morgan|J. Pierpont Morgan's]] J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
[[File:JacobSchiff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jacob Schiff]]

The firm grew to prominence during the [[History of rail transport in the United States#Expansion and consolidation .281878.E2.80.931916.29|railroad era]] in the United States. Americans saw great hope and promise in railroads and investors saw great opportunities to profit.  Kuhn, Loeb, like all investment banks, brought capital together with commercial opportunity.  Its first meaningful entry into railroad financing was in 1877 when it raised funds for the [[Chicago and North Western Railroad]], and several years later, in 1881, for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad]].

Schiff was instrumental in the reorganization of the [[Union Pacific]] in 1897, helping to place the firm on sound financial footing.  In 1901, with Kuhn, Loeb's financial support, [[E. H. Harriman]] famously battled [[James Jerome Hill]] and [[J.P. Morgan]] to acquire control of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]].

The firm was long associated with many of America's emerging industrial giants, providing financial backing for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] and [[Western Union]], as well as innovative consumer giants like the [[Polaroid Corporation]].  The firm also enjoyed respect as a trusted adviser overseas, providing services to numerous foreign governments, including the governments of Austria, Finland, Mexico and Venezuela.

It also acted as the leading investment house for [[John D. Rockefeller]], through the guidance of his investment adviser, [[Frederick T. Gates]]. Rockefeller invested in many syndicates with the bank, including major stakes in the prominent railroad companies, as well as contributing to its consolidation of the Chicago meatpackers, which resulted in the formation of a leading trust. Overseas ventures that Rockefeller also got involved with included the bank's loans to the Chinese and Imperial Japanese governments.

The firm also joined a partnership with Rockefeller in 1911 to gain control of the Equitable Trust Company, which was later to merge and become the [[Chase Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;The leading investment bank for the Rockefeller interests - see Ron Chernow, ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr''. London: Warner Books, 1998. (p.373, 377)&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous partners of the firm included [[Otto Kahn]], [[Paul Warburg]], [[Felix Warburg]], [[Mortimer Schiff]], [[Benjamin Buttenwieser]], [[Lewis Strauss]], and [[Sigmund Warburg]], founder of [[S. G. Warburg &amp; Co.|S.G. Warburg]]. [[Image:Otto Kahn 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Otto Kahn]]

In its early years, intermarriage among the German-Jewish elite was common.  Consequently, the partners of Kuhn, Loeb were closely related by blood and marriage to the partners of [[J &amp; W Seligman]], [[Speyer &amp; Co.]], [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.]], [[Lehman Brothers]] and other prominent German-Jewish firms.  Prior to the Second World War, a particularly close relationship existed between the partners of Kuhn, Loeb and [[M. M. Warburg &amp; Co.]] of [[Hamburg, Germany]], through Paul and Felix, who were Kuhn, Loeb partners.  Later on, following World War II, their cousin Sigmund Warburg would briefly continue this relationship as a partner and Executive Director of the firm.

The firm's fortunes began to fade in the years following World War II.  Wall Street was changing and shifting away from relationship banking.  Kuhn, Loeb's world of gentlemen bankers was gradually being replaced by a more aggressive, transaction-oriented Wall Street, with underwriters entering the trenches and selling securities directly to the public—territory Kuhn, Loeb stubbornly refused to enter.  When asked how many people worked at Kuhn, Loeb, one partner famously quipped, "about half".  Such was life at Kuhn, Loeb, resting on its laurels, while Wall Street passed it by.

In 1977, facing a capital crisis, the firm succumbed and merged with [[Lehman Brothers]], to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.  Internationally, the merged firms were known as Kuhn Loeb Lehman Brothers Inc., in recognition of the fact that Kuhn Loeb's international reputation was superior to that of Lehman's.

The merger did not, however, prove to be the panacea to what ailed Kuhn, Loeb.  Indeed, as detailed more closely in the [[Lehman Brothers]] history, a period of bitter internal strife ended in 1984 when the firm sold itself to [[Shearson]]/[[American Express]], itself the product of a recent merger between American Express and [[Sandy Weill|Sandy Weill's]], [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]].  The combined firms then dropped the Kuhn, Loeb name and became known as Shearson Lehman/American Express, ending Kuhn, Loeb's almost 120 years on Wall Street.

Later, the combined firm purchased disgraced [[E.F. Hutton]], becoming Shearson Lehman Hutton.  Ultimately, however, American Express could not make the pieces of its financial services supermarket work.  In 1993, under then newly appointed CEO, [[Harvey Golub]], the firm sold its retail brokerage operations to [[Primerica]].  In 1994, it spun off a beleaguered Lehman Brothers as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., in an initial public offering.

Although the Kuhn, Loeb name is probably gone forever, the firm's legacy is not.  Former Kuhn, Loeb employees remain in senior positions throughout Wall Street, and until recently, at Lehman Brothers.  Vestiges of the firm survived in the form of Lehman Brothers' extensive fixed income capabilities, including many of their [[Bond market index|bond indices]], such as the Government/Credit index.  This index, originally created in 1973 by Kuhn, Loeb, as the [[List of bond market indices#Government Bonds|Government/Corporate]] index, was among the first generation of bond index data to measure the fixed income market.  It is still the preeminent benchmark in its class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4438">[[File:Logo Label Rouge.gif|thumb|Label Rouge]]
'''Label Rouge''' (''Red Label'') is a sign of [[quality assurance]] in France as defined by Law No. 2006-11 (5 January 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|JORF]], 2006-01-06, p. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.definitions-marketing.com/Definition-Label-rouge| title = Définition Label rouge| work = Definitions Marketing  | accessdate = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products eligible for the Label Rouge are food items (including seafood) and non-food and unprocessed agricultural products such as flowers. According to the [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|French Ministry of Agriculture]]: "The Red Label certifies that a product has a specific set of characteristics establishing a superior level to that of a similar current product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.gouv.fr/le-label-rouge,10506 |title=Le Label rouge |work=Ministère de l'agriculture, de l'agro-alimentaire et de la forêt (translation by Google) |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025093751/http://agriculture.gouv.fr/le-label-rouge%2C10506 |archivedate=October 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquaculture==
In 1992, Scottish salmon was the first fish and first non-French product to be awarded the Label Rouge quality mark, the official endorsement by the French authorities of the superior quality of a food or farmed product, particularly with regard to taste.

To obtain this recognition, a very stringent set of standards prepared by a group of producers must be approved. These standards establish the criteria which the product must meet throughout the production chain, including farming techniques, feed, processing and distribution.

Approval is officially announced through a joint decree from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, on the recommendations of the National Institute for Origin and Quality (INAO). INAO is the French public body responsible for quality and origin marks relating to food products.

[http://www.saumonecossais.com/en/ Scottish Quality Salmon] is the standard owner of Label Rouge No. LA 33/90. Compliance with the standards is controlled by an independent certifying body, Acoura, formerly Food Certification International Ltd. Suppliers of [http://www.saumonecossais.com/fr/fournisseurs/saumon-frais-entier whole Label Rouge Scottish salmon] and [http://www.saumonecossais.com/fr/fournisseurs/saumon-frais-a-la-decoupe Label Rouge Scottish salmon portions] can be found on the [http://www.saumonecossais.com/en/ Label Rouge Saumon Ecossais website].

==A Quality Benchmark==
The quality manual for Label Rouge LA 33/90 specifies all the requirements for attaining this superior quality standard.

The PGI manual defines the criteria for product origin.

The following are significant elements of Label Rouge Scottish salmon’s exceptional quality:-

* The feed is composed entirely of products of marine origin, vegetable materials, vitamins and carotenoids
* The flesh contains a maximum of 16% lipid
* An identification system is implemented to ensure traceability of the salmon throughout the production process up to point of sale, guaranteeing origin and compliance with the stringent production criteria
* Freshness guaranteed by an "eat by date" of 10 days after harvesting
* Salmon are reared in accordance with codes of best practice and with respect for fish welfare, the environment and sustainability
* Maximum stocking density in seawater pens is 1.5% fish and 98.5% water
* Guaranteed Scottish origin

==Full traceability==
The origin of each Label Rouge salmon can be identified through a sequentially numbered tag allocated by the certifying body.

This tag is attached to the fish gill and includes the following information:-

* The Label Rouge logo
* The approval number
* An individual identification number
* A “use-by” date
* The contact details of the certifying body

In addition, each box carries a sequentially numbered label, also supplied by the certifying body.

'''Marketing ethics''' is an area of [[applied ethics]] which deals with the moral principles behind the operation and regulation of [[marketing]]. Some areas of marketing ethics (ethics of [[advertising]] and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]) overlap with [[media ethics]].

==Fundamental issues in the ethics of marketing ==

===Frameworks of analysis for marketing Possible frameworks===
* [[Value theory|Value]]-oriented framework, analyzing ethical problems on the basis of the values which they infringe (e.g. [[honesty]], [[autonomy]], [[privacy]], [[Transparency (market)|transparency]]). An example of such an approach is the AMA [[Statement of Ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/Statement%20of%20Ethics.aspx American Marketing Association Statement of Ethics] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stakeholder-oriented framework, analyzing ethical problems on the basis of whom they affect (e.g. consumers, competitors, society as a whole).
* Process-oriented framework, analyzing ethical problems in terms of the categories used by marketing specialists (e.g. research, price, promotion, placement).

None of these frameworks allows, by itself, a convenient and complete categorization of the great variety of issues in marketing ethics

===Power-based analysis===
Contrary to popular impressions, not all marketing is adversarial, and not all marketing is stacked in favour of the marketer. In marketing, the relationship between producer/consumer or buyer/seller can be adversarial or cooperative. For an example of cooperative marketing, see [[relationship marketing]]. If the marketing situation is adversarial, another dimension of difference emerges, describing the power balance 
between producer/consumer or buyer/seller. Power may be concentrated with the producer (''caveat emptor''),
but factors such as over-supply or legislation can shift the power towards the consumer (''caveat vendor''). Identifying where the power in the relationship lies and whether the power balance is relevant at all are important to understanding the background to an ethical dilemma in marketing ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Lizabeth England,[http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/journal/bus10background.htm Marketing With A Conscience: Sales and Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012224738/http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/journal/bus10background.htm |date=2006-10-12 }}, US Dept. of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Is marketing inherently evil? ===
A popularist anti-marketing stance commonly discussed on the blogosphere&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Kandy, [http://www.kingmarketing.ca/weblogs/ajkandy/archives/2004/09/is_marketing_ev.html Is marketing evil?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107034439/http://www.kingmarketing.ca/weblogs/ajkandy/archives/2004/09/is_marketing_ev.html |date=2006-11-07 }}, King Marketing, 2004; William DeJong, [http://www.youthtoday.org/youthtoday/insert/branded.html Marketing Gets Unfairly Branded as Evil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313121518/http://www.youthtoday.org/youthtoday/insert/branded.html |date=2007-03-13 }}, Youth Today; Kathy Sierra, [http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/08/you_are_a_marke.html You ARE a marketer. Deal with it], 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; and popular literature&lt;ref&gt;The vastness of the literature on this topic is perhaps best conveyed by D. Slaters 1999 [http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/slater/consumer/biblioa.htm bibliography of consumer culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006204628/http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/slater/consumer/biblioa.htm |date=2006-10-06 }} with over 1500 items. W.R. Childs (Ohio State University) has posted a [http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/childs1/BibliographyConsumer%20Culture.htm shorter bibliography of consumer culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909184003/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/childs1/BibliographyConsumer%20Culture.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is that any kind of marketing is inherently evil. The position is based on the argument that marketing necessarily commits at least one of three wrongs:
* Damaging personal [[autonomy]]. The victim of marketing in this case is the intended buyer whose right to self-determination is infringed.
* Causing harm to competitors. Excessively fierce competition and unethical marketing tactics are especially associated with [[market saturation|saturated markets]].
* Manipulating social values. The victim in this case is society as a whole, or the environment as well. The argument is that marketing promotes [[consumerism]] and waste. See also: [[affluenza]], [[ethical consumerism]], [[anti-consumerism]].

==Specific issues in marketing ethics==

===Market research===
Market research is the collection and analysis of information about consumers, competitors and the effectiveness of marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/marketing/g/marketresearch.htm|title=5 Ways to Improve Your Business With Market Research|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With market research, businesses can make decisions based on how the responses of the market, leading to a better understanding of how the business has to adapt to the changing market. It is used to establish which portion of the population will or does purchase a product, based on age, gender, location, income level, and many other variables. This research allows companies to learn more about past, current, and potential customers, including their specific likes and dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-market-research.htm|title=What is Market Research? (with pictures)|author=|date=|website=wisegeek.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical danger points in market research include:
* Invasion of [[privacy]]..
* [[Stereotyping]].
'''Invasion of privacy'''

As companies conduct research they also come into contact with confidential and personal information, which comes with a level of risk for both the business as well as the individual. Now day’s consumers are bombarded with mail after using their email address to enter in a competition thus becoming part of a businesses mailing list. Therefore, companies are provided with critical information, which they must not take advantage of but use in an ethical manner.

'''Stereotyping:'''

Portraying an ideal body, weight or physical appearance can have potential harmful effects on the individual such as low self-esteem issues or anorexia. Good marketing is ethical marketing, it is about pleasing and developing a strong relationship with customers in a caring manner by not primarily only focusing on achieving results in order to generate profit.

People affected by unethical market research:
* Public
* Respondents 
* Client
* Researcher

Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.[31] In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.&lt;ref&gt;^ Quinn, Michael J. (2009). Ethics for the Information Age. {{ISBN|0-321-53685-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Stereotyping occurs because any analysis of real populations needs to make approximations and place individuals into groups. However, if conducted irresponsibly, stereotyping can lead to a variety of ethically undesirable results. In the [[American Marketing Association]] Statement of Ethics, stereotyping is countered by the obligation to show respect ("acknowledge the basic human dignity of all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingpower.com/content435.php American Marketing Association Statement of Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022073114/http://www.marketingpower.com/content435.php |date=2006-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market audience===
Ethical danger points include:
* Excluding potential customers from the market: selective marketing is used to discourage demand from undesirable market sectors or disenfranchise them altogether.
* Targeting the vulnerable (e.g. children, the elderly).

Examples of unethical market exclusion&lt;ref&gt;The term "selective marketing" is preferred. The term [[market exclusion]] is normally used in the different context of a cartel of suppliers excluding newcomers from distribution chains.&lt;/ref&gt; or selective marketing are past industry attitudes to the gay, ethnic minority and
plus size markets. Contrary to the popular myth that ethics and profits do not mix,
the tapping of these markets has proved highly profitable. For example, 20% of US clothing sales are now plus-size.&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/01/health/main586142.shtml Plus-Size People, Plus-Size Stuff], Nov 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the selective marketing of health care, so that unprofitable sectors (i.e. the elderly) will not
attempt to take benefits to which they are entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Waymack, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u272127w46m1631v/ The ethics of selectively marketing the Health Maintenance Organization], Journal of Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics, Issue Volume 11, Number 4 / December 1990, Pages 301-309&lt;/ref&gt;
A further example of market exclusion is the pharmaceutical industry's exclusion of developing countries
from [[AIDS drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruairí Brugha, [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/326/7403/1382 Antiretroviral treatment in developing countries], BMJ 2003;326:1382-1384&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of marketing which unethically targets the elderly include: [[living trust]]s, [[time share]] fraud, [[mass marketing fraud]]&lt;ref&gt;Senior Journal, [http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Alerts/6-05-24-HundredsArrested.htm Hundreds Arrested in Mass-Marketing Fraud Targeting Senior Citizens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017074152/http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Alerts/6-05-24-HundredsArrested.htm |date=2006-10-17 }}, May 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, [http://www.dfi.wa.gov/consumers/education/seniors/elderly_frauds.htm Frauds That Target The Elderly], July 11, 2006 (Originally from: [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] Consumer News)&lt;/ref&gt;
The elderly hold a disproportionate amount of the world's wealth and are therefore the target of financial exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;US Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/services/apact/apact01.htm Consumer fraud against the elderly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926153738/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/services/apact/apact01.htm |date=2006-09-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of children, the main products are unhealthy food, fashionware and entertainment goods. Children are a lucrative market: "...children 12 and under spend more than $11 billion of their own money and influence family spending decisions worth another $165 billion",&lt;ref name="Getting Inside Kids' Heads"&gt;Tom McGee and Kevin Heubusch, `Getting Inside Kids' Heads', American Demographics, Vol. 19, No. 1 (1997), quoted in Sharon Beder, [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/children.html Marketing to Children], University of Wollongong, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; but are not capable of resisting or understanding marketing tactics at younger ages ("children don't understand persuasive intent until they are eight or nine years old"&lt;ref name="Getting Inside Kids' Heads" /&gt;). At older ages competitive feelings towards other children are stronger than financial sense. The practice of extending children's marketing from television to the school grounds is also controversial (see [[marketing in schools]]). The following is a select list of online articles:

Other vulnerable audiences include emerging markets in developing countries, where the public may not be sufficiently aware of skilled marketing ploys transferred from developed countries, and where, conversely, marketers may not be aware how excessively powerful their tactics may be. See [[Nestlé boycott|Nestle infant milk formula scandal]]. Another vulnerable group are mentally unstable consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Josefson, [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/316/7132/645/g Marketing of antipsychotic drugs attacked] [[BMJ]] 1998;316:645&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of vulnerability is also problematic: for example, when should [[debt|endebtedness]] be seen as a vulnerability and when should "cheap" loan providers be seen as [[loan sharks]], unethically exploiting the economically disadvantaged?

'''Targeting the Vulnerable'''

Marketing targeting strategies for products that may cause economic, physical and psychological harm has become an aspect of marketing which is criticized a considerable amount, especially in marketing literature with a particular focus on vulnerable consumers

Children, elderly consumers, and economically disadvantaged consumers are often categorized as being a part of the vulnerable group in marketing, in terms of ethics. “Ethics and social responsibility communities seem to agree that targeting a vulnerable group with marketing campaigns that take advantage of their vulnerability is unjust”. George G Brenkert was amongst the first to raise the issue about taking advantage of the vulnerability of a person, which therefore makes marketing practices immoral or unjust. Adolescents and children in the US are major market force in the food and beverage industry and as a result, food marketers are “attracted to the youth as consumers because of their spending power, purchasing influences and as future adult consumers”. It is ethically wrong to target children especially when it comes to unhealthy food and beverages, as children may not want anything else, which could lead to child obesity. Children have difficulty deciding between the purpose of advertising and other modes of communication; therefore it is morally unacceptable to target vulnerable children with such products. In Belgium, it is banned to show commercials during children’s programs, similarly in Australia, such ads are not allowed during television programs for preschoolers.  It is considered unethical to generate profits through marketing to vulnerable groups, such as children, the poor or the elderly.

The ethics of marketing practice, especially directed towards the vulnerable can be divided into two areas, product and process.

Process related ethical issues are often demonstrated through the use of deceptive or misleading advertising, where as product related issues is predominately focuses on marketing of certain “harmful” products such as tobacco, unhealthy food etc.

'''Excluding potential customers from the market:'''

There are certain high caution aspects of ethical marketing in terms of market audience. Using selective marketing to discourage demand from an unwanted market group or exclude them altogether. Examples of market exclusion or selective marketing are certain company’s attitudes towards the gay, ethnic groups and overweight (plus size) market groups. Customers are treated like this because companies think that they are unprofitable so they try to deprive them or avoid them altogether.  It is often debated amongst the business community that in order to be profitable, often businesses have to be unethical. However, this idea is seemingly outdated as most businesses nowadays follow an ethical business plan. In the United States, plus size apparel is thought to have generated $17.5 billion between May 2013 and April 2014, which is a 5% increase from the previous year, this is to be expected as 65% of American women are plus sized . Another example of exclusion from the market is some pharmaceutical industry’s exclude developing countries from AIDS drugs

===Pricing ethics===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

'''Pricing ethics:'''

Pricing along with product, place and promotion are the four functions of marketing.  Retailers and producers must ensure that ethical pricing strategies are performed in order to earn profits without deceiving competitors or consumers .

However buyers and sellers have different goals and perceived outcomes in the exchange process. Usually buyers are seeking to gain products and services at the best possible price whereas sellers are generally concentrated on generating maximum profit.

'''Price fixing:'''

Price fixing is maintaining a price at a certain level, which has been agreed upon between competing sellers and is illegal in most countries . When price fixing occurs and a price is set by an industry, customers are forced to pay the exorbitant price due to a lack of options.

Price fixing is thought to be unethical and socially irresponsible as it breaks laws that are specifically put into place to promote regular competition between companies . With competition between companies, business will be likely to keep costs low at affordable prices, in order to compete.

'''Price wars:'''

Price wars, is when businesses constantly lower its prices in an attempt to demoralize its competition . Price wars can create emotionally devastating and psychologically devastating situations, which has an extraordinary impact on an individual, a company and industry profits .  The intention of a price war is to drive competitors out of the market or to create an entry barrier into the market.  Although it is beneficial for consumers, as they will get the product or service at a low price, however they are often deprived for quality. Also in the long term, it will force other competitors out of business and lower profits threaten business survival.  If a company is involved in price war tactics, then it can be seen as unethical within the industry because they are starting a dangerous position and driving other companies to use similar tactics.  A companies overall goal is to maximize its profits and revenue, however through engaging in a price war they are unable to do this and are more likely making less money as they would have had they taken part in normal business competition. If price wars can be avoided, it will prove to be vital success for any business.

'''Price Collusion:'''

Price Collusion is when several companies get together in order to hold the price of a good or service at a raised level in the hopes of achieving large profits or restricting the market. Price fixing is sometimes called price collusion in order to emphasize the agreement using secretive, to avoid fair competition.

Pricing practices that are considered unethical in most geographic markets include:
* [[Bid rigging]]
* [[Dumping (pricing policy)]]
* [[Predatory pricing]]
* [[Price gouging]]
* [[Price fixing]]
* [[Supra competitive pricing]]

List of pricing practices which may be unethical in certain circumstances and should be used with caution:
* [[Price discrimination]] (except where differential prices can be justified on economic grounds, such as discounts for volume purchasers)
* [[Price skimming]]
* [[Price war]]
* [[Variable pricing]]

===Ethics in advertising and promotion===
Advertising is mass and paid communication, with a fundamental purpose to deliver information, acquire attitudes and induce action beneficial to the advertiser – generally the sale of the product or service.   Advertising and promotion have a significant influence on people, society in large, while shaping their attitudes, behaviors and priorities . Some scholars believe that advertising supports ethical issues. It is also considered unethical to shame a substitute or rivals product or services (Srivastava &amp; Nandan, 2010). Other ethical issues include, mistreatment of women, advertising to children, misleading advertising and other issues, which lead to ethical decline of society. Mistreatment of women is evident immensely in advertisements. Often women are matched up with household products such as cleaning supplies and are shown as doing domestic work, which represents stereotyping of women. Women are also often used as sex symbols, to convey particular messages about products. Also men are often apparent in DIY (do it yourself) ads, which deliver the idea of them being a “handy man. An ad, which demonstrates ethical features, is truthful, it doesn’t make false claims, and it provides sufficient information for the buyer to make informed choices. Exhibiting a level of respect and dignity for its buyers is important while demonstrating decency. An example of an advert produced by Coca Cola, through using false advertising, it showed unethical issues behind its production. Coca Cola used of Karl Langerfeld (Chanel designer) who had claimed to lose 80 pounds on a diet that was mainly attributed to diet coke, “I drink diet coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed and I drink nothing else”. This advert was specially targeted towards women as it aimed to be conveyed as a fashion trend, through the use of a famous fashion designer. Coke used thin models and world-renowned fashion designers both of whom are cautious of body image, which shows the wrong message for women, especially young women. The advert shows that going overboard with dieting is conventional and that diet coke is the way of going about achieving a thin and attractive body. It is ethically wrong to be using Karl Lagerfeld’s extreme dieting ways in order to promote diet coke. It is not only advocating an extreme statement, but it is also sending the wrong message about the drink by directly associating it to a “healthy ideal body”. Often the line between ethical and unethical advertising is blurred, what may seem unethical to some consumers or businesses, may not to for others. Therefore, in cases like this, businesses should proceed with caution, because unethical advertising and promotion can fail, causing consumers to shy away from the company consequently defeating the purpose of any campaign. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gucci_big.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Gucci]] advert]] --&gt;

Ethical pitfalls in advertising and promotional content include:
* Issues over truth and honesty. In the 1940s and 1950s, [[tobacco]] used to be advertised as ''promoting'' health.&lt;ref&gt;Chickenhead Productions, [http://www.chickenhead.com/truth/index.html Truth in Advertising].&lt;/ref&gt; Today an advertiser who fails to tell the truth not only offends against morality but also against the law. However the law permits "[[puffery]]" (a legal term).&lt;ref&gt;Lew McCreary, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060511100850/http://www.cmoresource.com/read/070105/lies_puffery.html Lies, Damn Lies and Puffery: Is it OK to bend the truth if no one believes you anyway?], CMO Magazine, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between mere [[puffery]] and [[fraud]] is a [[slippery slope]]: "The problem... is the slippery slope by which variations on puffery can descend fairly quickly to lies."&lt;ref&gt;S.Gilman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20031219095040/http://www.ethics.org/today/et_v2n10903.html Ethics Today Newsletter], September 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; See main article: [[false advertising]].
* Issues with violence, sex and profanity. [[Sexual innuendo]] is a mainstay of advertising content (see [[sex in advertising]]), and yet is also regarded as a form of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;S.J.Gould, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3694/is_199409/ai_n8721609 Sexuality and ethics in advertising: A research agenda and policy guideline perspective], Journal of Advertising, Sep 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is an issue especially for children's advertising and advertising likely to be seen by children.
* Taste and controversy. The advertising of certain products may strongly offend some people while being in the interests of others. Examples include: [[feminine hygiene]] products, [[hemorrhoid]] and [[constipation]] medication.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Waller, [http://conferences.arts.usyd.edu.au/viewpaper.php?id=233&amp;cf=3 What factors make controversial advertising offensive?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914045132/http://conferences.arts.usyd.edu.au/viewpaper.php?id=233&amp;cf=3 |date=2007-09-14 }}, ANZCA04 Conference, Sydney, July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The advertising of [[condoms]] has become acceptable in the interests of [[AIDS]]-prevention, but are nevertheless seen by some as promoting [[promiscuity]]. Some companies have actually marketed themselves on the basis of controversial advertising - see [[Benetton Group|Benetton]]. [[Sony]] has also frequently attracted criticism for unethical content (portrayals of Jesus which infuriated religious groups; racial innuendo in marketing black and white versions of its PSP product; graffiti adverts in major US cities).&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Cole, [http://www.joystiq.com/2005/12/03/sonys-fony-graffiti-sparks-lashback/ Sony's fony graffiti sparks lashback], Joystiq, Dec 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Negative advertising]] techniques, such as [[attack ad]]s. In negative advertising, the advertiser highlights the disadvantages of competitor products rather than the advantages of their own. The methods are most familiar from the political sphere: see [[negative campaigning]].
* Delivery channels
* [[Direct marketing]] is the most controversial of advertising channels, particularly when approaches are unsolicited. TV commercials and direct mail are common examples. Electronic [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[telemarketing]] push the borders of ethics and legality more strongly.
* [[Shill]]s and [[astroturfing|astroturfers]] are examples of ways for delivering a marketing message under the guise of independent product reviews and endorsements, or creating supposedly independent watchdog or review organisations. For example, fake reviews can be published on Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Monson-Haefel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20041211092459/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/monsonhaefel/archive/2003/11/amazoncom_revie.html Amazon.com reviews are a farce], Jave.net, Nov 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Shills are primarily for message-delivery, but they can also be used to drive up prices in auctions, such as [[Ebay]] auctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/shills.html Shill Bidding Exposed in E-Bay Auctions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019055914/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/shills.html |date=2006-10-19 }}, Consume Affairs, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Native advertising]] is the blurring of lines between advertising and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/12/blurred-lines-advertising-or-content-ftc-workshop-native|title=Blurred Lines: Advertising or Content? – An FTC Workshop on Native Advertising|author=|date=14 November 2013|website=ftc.gov|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deceptive Advertising and Ethics====
Another breach of marketing ethics has to do with the use of deceptive advertising. This form of advertising is not specific to one target market, and can sometimes go unnoticed by the public. There are a number of different ways in which deceptive marketing can be presented to consumers; one of these methods is accomplished through the use of humor. In a study conducted by Hassib Shabbir and Des Thwaites, 238 advertisements were assessed and 73.5% of them were found to have used deceptive marketing practices. Of those advertisements that were conducted deceptively, 74.5% of them used humor as a masking device in order to mislead potential customers. Part of what drives this study is the idea that humor provides an escape or relief from some kind of human constraint, and that some advertisers intend to take advantage of this by deceptively advertising a product that can potentially alleviate that constraint through humor. Through the study it was also found that all types of humor are used to deceive consumers, and that there are certain types of humor that are used when making certain deceptive claims.

It is important to understand that humor is not the only method that is used to deter consumer’s minds from what a product actually offers. Before making important purchases, one should always conduct their own research in order to gain a better understanding of what it is they are investing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shabbir | first1 = H. | last2 = Thwaites | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = The use of humor to mask deceptive advertising | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 75–85 | doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367360205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The use of ethics as a marketing tactic===
Business ethics has been an increasing concern among larger companies, at least since the 1990s. Major corporations increasingly fear the damage to their image associated with press revelations of unethical practices. Marketers have been among the fastest to perceive the market's preference for ethical companies, often moving faster to take advantage of this shift in consumer taste. This results in the expropriation of ethics itself as a selling point or a component of a corporate image.
* [[The Body Shop]] is an example of a company which marketed itself and its entire product range solely on an ethical message.
*[[Greenwash]] is an example of a strategy used to make a company appear ethical when its unethical practices continue.
* [[Liberation marketing]] is another strategy whereby a product can masquerade behind an image that appeals to a range of values, including ethical values related to lifestyle and anti-consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klminc.com/marketing/lib_marketing.html Liberation Marketing and Consumer Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031031803/http://www.klminc.com/marketing/lib_marketing.html |date=2006-10-31 }}, KLM Inc., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Liberation marketing takes the old mass culture critique — consumerism as conformity — fully into account, acknowledges it, addresses it, and solves it. Liberation marketing imagines consumers breaking free from the old enforcers of order, tearing loose from the shackles with which capitalism has bound us, escaping the routine of bureaucracy and hierarchy, getting in touch with our true selves, and finally, finding authenticity, that holiest of consumer grails."'' ([[Thomas Frank]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Frank, [http://www.casualarts.net/Liberation%20Marketing.pdf Liberation Marketing and the Culture Trust], (date unknown).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Neuromarketing ethics===
[[Neuromarketing]] and its precursor, [[neuroeconomics]], uses clinical information about brain functions and mechanisms to
help explain what is happening inside of the “black box” so prevalent in many explanations of consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Fugate (2007) [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1637461 Neuromarketing - a layman's look at neuroscience and its  potential application to marketing practice], Journal of Consumer Marketing, 24(7) Pages 385–394&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so, specialists use neuroimaging techniques and record brain responses to different stimuli.
[http://nmsba.com The Neuromarketing Science &amp; Business Association] has launched on November 2012 a [http://www.neuromarketing-association.com/ethics Neuromarketing Code of Ethics]. This is a first step towards adopting international standards applied to using neuroscientific methods to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, packaging and product design, as well as communication campaigns from non-profit organizations and government institutions.  However, some ethicists condemn the code as protecting only a very narrow class, and in the extreme position that neuromarketing itself should only be used for the advancement of what is reasonably believed to be public good, employing Thomas Aquinas' doctrine of double effect (DDE).  Although one could make the argument that engineering profit serves the public good, it would not be saved under the DDE because the intention behind it is not to generate a greater good than to which the collective harm of manipulation is greater.  However, neuromarketing programs to encourage healthy lifestyle choices may be saved under the DDE, provided it is based on good scientific information in the first place, such as regular exercise.

===Marketing strategy===
The main theoretical issue here is the debate between [[free markets]] and [[controlled market|regulated markets]].
In a truly free market, any participant can make or change the rules. However, when new rules
are invented which shift power too suddenly or too far, other participants may respond with
accusations of unethical behaviour, rather than modifying their own behaviour to suit (which they
might not be able to anyway). Most markets are not fully free: the real debate is as to the
appropriate extent of regulation.

Case: [[California electricity crisis]], which demonstrates how constant innovation of
new marketing strategies by companies such as [[Enron]] outwitted the regulatory bodies
and caused substantial harm to consumers and competitors.

A list of known unethical or controversial marketing strategies:
* [[Anti-competitive practices]]
* [[Bait and switch]]
* [[Planned obsolescence]]
* [[Pyramid scheme]]
* [[Vendor lock-in]] / [[Vendor lock-out]]
* [[Viral marketing]] / [[guerilla marketing]]
* [[Subliminal advertising]]

Controversial marketing strategies associated with the internet:
* [[Embrace, extend and extinguish]]
* [[Search engine optimisation]]
* [[Spamdexing]]
* [[Spyware]] / [[Adware]]

=== Further issues in marketing ethics ===
Marketing ethics overlaps with environmental ethics in respect of waste problems associated with the packaging of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/LS/marketing/Download/Marketingethik.pdf Definition of marketing ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224017/http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/LS/marketing/Download/Marketingethik.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }} (in German), excerpted from: Bruhn, M., Homburg, C.: Gabler Marketing Lexikon, Wiesbaden 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as members of the advocacy group [[No Free Lunch (organization)|No Free Lunch]], have argued that marketing by [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] is negatively impacting physicians' prescribing practices, influencing them to prescribe the marketed drugs rather than others which may be cheaper or better for the patient.&lt;ref name="Koerner"&gt;Brendan I. Koerner. [https://www.motherjones.com/news/hellraiser/2003/03/ma_290_01.html Dr. No Free Lunch].  ''Mother Jones'', March/April, 2003. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical thinking is responding to situations that deal with principles concerning human behavior in respect to the appropriateness and inappropriateness of certain communication and to the decency and indecency of the intention and results of such actions.  In other words, ethics are distinctions between right and wrong.  Businesses are confronted with ethical decision making every day, and whether employees decide to use ethics as a guiding force when conducting business is something that business leaders, such as managers, need to instill. Marketers are ethically responsible for what is marketed and the image that a product portrays.  With that said, marketers need to understand what good ethics are and how to incorporate good ethics in various marketing campaigns to better reach a targeted audience and to gain trust from customers.

Marketing ethics, regardless of the product offered or the market targeted, sets the guidelines for which good marketing is practiced.  When companies create high ethical standards upon which to approach marketing they are participating in ethical marketing. To market ethically and effectively one should be reminded that all marketing decisions and efforts are necessary to meet and suit the needs of customers, suppliers, and business partners.  Ethical behavior should be enforced throughout [[company culture]] and through company practices.

However, marketers have been known to market questionable products to the public.  These tend to be controversial products in that they appeal to some while offending others. An example of such a product that is sold regularly today is a cheap handgun. America is a country in which its citizens have the right to bear arms, yet these weapons are criticized by the public because they are sold at a low price making it rather easy to purchase by members of less affluent communities. Critics have referred to these weapons as " Saturday Night Specials" referring to the negative connotation that they are purchased to commit crimes. In defense of the critics opinions, if in fact these guns are purchased with the intent to commit such crimes, than one must question the ethics behind marketing these products to criminals. Is the marketer facilitating the crime by appealing to this target market with a weapon that is easily accessible?  While  the argument in this case may seem unethical due to the questionable nature of these cheap handguns, this argument does not apply to the sale of all guns. That is because weapons that are legally sold to customers at an affordable rate for safety purposes, self-defense, hunting, and law enforcement are perfectly ethical due to the fact that they are safe product that is marketed to a responsible consumer. This comparison supports the fact that ethical marketing can be perceived differently consumers depending on the nature of the nature of the product that is being sold.

==Regulation and enforcement==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Marketing ethics and [[consumer law|marketing law]] are related subjects. Relevant areas of law include [[consumer law]] which protects consumers and [[antitrust|antitrust law]] which protects competitors - in both cases, against unethical marketing practices. Regulation extends beyond the law to lobbies, watchdog bodies and self-regulatory industry bodies.

'''Maytag''' is a [[blue cheese]] produced on the [[Maytag Dairy Farms]] outside of [[Newton, Iowa]], the former home of the [[Maytag Corporation]].  In 1938, [[Iowa State University]] independently developed a process for making blue cheese from [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenized]] cow's [[milk]] instead of the traditional sheep's milk.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19900117&amp;id=WMAcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3H4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5744,1218062 |first1=Susan Hermann |last1=Lewis |date=January 17, 1990 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal]]/[[New York Times]] service |title=Its cheese is the only thing blue about this Iowa dairy |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1941 production of the cheese was started by [[Frederick L. Maytag II]] and Robert Maytag, grandsons of the founder of the [[Maytag]] appliance company, [[Frederick Louis Maytag I]]. The milk for the cheese initially came from a prize-winning herd of [[Holstein cattle]] that was established by [[E. H. Maytag]], a son of the Maytag founder.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maytag Farms Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maytag Dairy Farms|url=http://www.maytagblue.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016}} the company was owned by the third and fourth generations of the Maytag family.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

The farm has survived without advertising or a sales staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backroadspress.com/_blog/Backroads_Journal/post/The_Famous_Maytag_Blue_Cheese/ |title=The Famous Maytag Blue Cheese |website=Backroads Journal |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 Maytag issued three recalls with the [[FDA]] for possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, and subsequently stopped production and shipping for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/06/maytag-dairy-taking-months-to-clean-up-listeria-problem |title=Maytag Dairy taking months to clean up Listeria problem |website=Food Safety News |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2016 operations resumed and a new fall catalog was issued.

As of September, 2017, sales have resumed.

== Process ==

The process for making Maytag Blue Cheese was discovered and patented in the United States by two [[Iowa State University]] microbiologists, Clarence Lane and Bernard W. Hammer. [[Roquefort]], another type of [[blue cheese]], had been made for hundreds of years in Europe, but attempts to manufacture a similar cheese in the United States had thus far been unsuccessful. Difficulties encountered in making these types of cheeses produced a less than satisfactory product, and quality control would have been disastrous.

"During the Second World War, [the] university patented the homogenisation of cheese milk and attempted to have charges levied on Danish cheese produced using homogenised milk. Their attempts failed, as it could be proved that this method had been introduced 20 years earlier in Denmark by Marius Boe."&lt;ref name="danablu"&gt; {{Cite web |url=http://ecta2013.ecta.org/IMG/pdf/gi_application_danablu.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=AMENDMENT APPLICATION COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 510/2006 AMENDMENT APPLICATION ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 9 ‘DANABLU’ EC No: DK-PGI-0217-0328-21.02.2011 |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214171136/http://ecta2013.ecta.org/IMG/pdf/gi_application_danablu.pdf |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems encountered with producing Roquefort type cheeses in the United States for distribution were the lengthy time required to develop the flavor, the mold growth not being uniform, the quality being below average for numerous lots produced, and the color of the curd being too dark.&lt;ref name="Patent for Making Blue Veined Cheese"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 2132077: Method for Making Blue Veined Cheese|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2132077.pdf/}}{{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenizing]] the milk used for the cheese. The cream is separated from the milk, homogenized and then added back into the now skim milk, typically at between 80 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (27 and 38 °C) and 2000 to 3500 [[pounds-force per square inch]] (14 to 24 MPa) of pressure.&lt;ref name="Patent for Making Blue Veined Cheese"/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow for proper fat [[hydrolysis]], which affects the flavor of the cheese.

There is a ripening period prior to adding [[rennet]] (a mixture of enzymes that coagulates milk into [[curds]] and [[whey]]) to the cheese.  Typically 3 ounces of rennet are added per 100 pounds of milk, allowing it to set in a temperature range of 85 to 86 °F (30 °C).  Better results were achieved using 4 ounces of rennet per 100 pounds of milk and setting in a higher than usual temperature range of 90 to 92 °F (32 to 33 °C).&lt;ref name="Patent for Making Blue Veined Cheese"/&gt;

According to Lane and Hammer's records, their alterations caused the cheese-making process to speed up from this point forward, with the time spent setting, cutting and dipping nearly cut in half. Also, after dipping the cheese and allowing it to cook in hot whey, the draining time was cut from 20–30 minutes to 3–5 minutes.

''[[Penicillium]]'' is then added to the finished product, which produces its characteristic green veins.&lt;ref name="Patent for Making Blue Veined Cheese"/&gt;

After the rounds of cheese are made by hand, the cheese is aged in specially designed caves where they are exposed to high humidity and cool temperatures.&lt;ref name="Maytag Farms Website"/&gt;
 
{{As of|2017}} the cheese continued to be made by hand with milk from local dairy farms.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maytag Farms Website"/&gt;

==Results==
The process produces cheese with more uniform color, flavor, and texture than previous processes, resulting in a consistent product.

The '''Metal Construction Association''' ('''MCA''') was formed in 1984 with a focus on  growing the use of metal in [[construction]] through marketing, education, and selective action on public policies that affect metal’s use in building projects.

== History ==
The concept of the MCA began in March 1983 when members of the now-defunct Metal Building Component Manufacturers Association wanted to create a new, expanded association. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalmag.com/economic-conditions/celebrating-metal.aspx Celebrating Metal - MetalMag]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406012544/http://www.metalmag.com/economic-conditions/celebrating-metal.aspx |date=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MCA took shape later that year when these companies contributed seed money for the new organization: American Building Components; Binkley Company; Corrugated Metal; Engineered Components; McElroy Metal; Metal Building Components Inc.; Moncrief Lenoir; and Omega Metal Building Products. 

The new organization was officially named the Metal Construction Association and its purpose was—to promote the use of metal in all phases of construction and collectively oppose any legislation that deters the use of metal. 
Today, that remains the essence of MCA’s strategic focus - to grow the use of metal through marketing, education, and selective action on public policies that affect metal’s use in building projects. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalmag.com/associations/dedication-and-determination-keys-to-longevity.aspx Keys to Longevity - MetalMag]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406012601/http://www.metalmag.com/associations/dedication-and-determination-keys-to-longevity.aspx |date=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 MCA helped establish the [[Metal Roofing Alliance]], a national marketing initiative that has helped achieve MCA goals in the residential market. It’s a separately run entity closely aligned with MCA activities. In 2002,MCA worked with the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] and the [[Metal Building Manufacturers Association]] (among others) as part of the Steel Coalition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalconstruction.org/pubs/pdf/SteelCoalitionLubricant051402.pdf Steel Coalition Lubricant Task Group Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, MCA launched The Metal Initiative a program that educates decision makers and influencers in the commercial building market.

==Career==

===Personal career===
[[File:Miguel Amaral.jpg|thumb|left|The Count of Alferrarede.]]
A [[mechanical engineer]] [[List of INSEAD alumni|diplomed]] with a [[MBA]] from [[INSEAD]],&lt;ref&gt;''Anuário da Nobreza de Portugal'', III, 1985, Tomo I, p. 223 and Tomo II, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Amaral was the former majority owner of the [[Media Capital]] group, a conglomerate that owns the [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]] TV channel and several radio stations, including [[Rádio Comercial]] and [[Rádio Clube Português]] in Portugal. He sold a majority stake in the group to [[PRISA]] in 2005.

His current business interests are concentrated in Quifel Group, via 4 sub-holdings: a) Almanac; b) Quifel Natural Resources; c) AHS Investimentos; d) Partgris. Through these investment vehicles, Miguel Pais do Amaral has relevant stakes in companies such as  LeYa, The Edge Group, Campo Largo Patrimonial, Ikaros-Hemera, Novabase, Reditus, Fitness Hut, Casa da Anadia and others. The majority of his investments are concentrated in Portugal and Brazil in the Education, Renewable Energy and Real Estate.

===Racing career===
He began racing in the [[Portuguese Cross-Country Rally Championship]], as well as in the [[Portuguese Classic Touring Car Championship]]. In 2001, he teamed up with [[Pedro Couceiro]] to drive in the [[Spanish GT Championship]] before the two joined [[ASM Team]]. Later, he teamed up with [[Miguel de Castro]] driving a [[Porsche 997 GT3]] RSR, and in 2009 he won the [[Trofeu Iberico de GT]].

In [[2006 Le Mans Series season|2006]]. Amaral purchased a [[Lola B05/40]] [[Le Mans prototype]], formerly run by [[Chamberlain Engineering|Chamberlain-Synergy Motorsports]] in the [[Le Mans Series]]. After one win under the Chamberlain name, the team scored two more victories as ASM, but this prevented Amaral and his co-drivers Miguel Angel de Castro and [[Angel Burgueño]] from winning their class. Amaral and ASM Team continue to run their Lola in the Le Mans Series in [[2007 Le Mans Series season|2007]] and [[2008 Le Mans Series season|2008]]. In [[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009]], Amaral and [[Olivier Pla]] raced a [[Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2]], and won the [[LMP2]] championship.

'''Miroslav Mišković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Мирослав Мишковић}}; born July 5, 1945) is a Serbian [[business magnate]], investor, and owner of [[Delta Holding]]. Mišković is richest person in Serbia with an average [[net worth]] of $4.6 billion. 
Mišković's net worth was estimated to be [[USD|$]]2 billion in 2007, according to the list of 100 wealthiest persons of the post-communist countries made by [[Poland|Polish]] magazine ''[[Wprost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://najbogatsieuropejczycy.wprost.pl The wealthiest in post-communist countries]&lt;/ref&gt;.Mišković holds 42nd place on this list, but is fifth among the [[tycoon]]s outside the former [[Soviet Union]]. According to the [[Forbes list of billionaires (2007)|2007 list of the richest people in the world]], published annually by [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], Mišković is a newcomer to this list, taking the 891st spot, with a net worth of [[Dollar|$]]1 billion. He is the first person from Serbia to enter this list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Miroslav-Miskovic_CVDZ.html 2007 Forbes' annual billionaires' list]&lt;/ref&gt; He was not listed in the latest Forbes' 2016 list so it's assumed that his net worth went significantly down in the recent years.

==Early life==
Mišković was born in 1945 in the small village of [[Bošnjane (Varvarin)|Bošnjane]], Central Serbia. He was raised and lived on his family's farm.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miroslavmiskovic.rs/who-is-miroslav-miskovic.php|title=Who is Miroslav Miskovic?|publisher=miroslavmiskovic.rs|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age eight, Mišković was almost blinded in his left eye when a playmate accidentally struck him with a rock while playing with a slingshot, losing 90% of his vision.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Mišković completed his high school education in the nearby city of [[Kruševac]] and graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]] branch in [[Kragujevac]] in 1971, majoring in finance and economics.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Afterwards, he worked at [[Jugobanka]] and [[Trayal]] until 1977, when he found work at [[Župa Chemical Industries]] (ZCI). 

==Business career==
Mišković became financial director of ZCI in 1984, and [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] in 1987 until 1990, when he briefly served as [[deputy prime minister]] in the [[government of Serbia]] for only six months in office. Meanwhile, Mišković founded Delta M (Delta M being a sort of abbreviation of his initials - ''double M'') in 1991, a company that became very successful in the following years, during the [[Yugoslav wars]] and under the regime of [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Soon afterwards, he launched [[Banca Intesa Beograd|Delta banka]] (sold to [[Banca Intesa]] in 2005), that was to become the first part of Mišković's extremely successful [[Delta Holding]] corporation that is involved in agribusiness, retail sales, distribution, financial brokerage, real estate development and insurance.

Mišković's connection to [[Slobodan Milošević]] was never obvious, except for his short stint as deputy prime minister in 1990. After the [[5th October Overthrow|overthrow of Milošević's regime]], Mišković was linked to [[Dušan Mihajlović (politician)|Dušan Mihajlović]], the minister of police at the time, and the other leaders of the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] coalition. 

After 5 October 2000, Mišković took an advantage of privatisation and started building his empire. As he has managed to purchase most of large companies post Djindjic murder, it is often argued that Mišković was 'buying Serbia' with money that was taken out to Cyprus during Milosevic reign. 

Mišković is today considered to be a figure of great influence on the leading politicians in Serbia. 

Mišković was abducted on 9 April 2001, but was released the next day, when the ransom (estimated at about 7 million [[Deutsche Mark]]'s) was paid 18 hours later. After the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]] on 12 March 2003, the abduction of Mišković was attributed to the same group that has been convicted of the death of the prime minister and other similar crimes. He was owner of Maxi and Delta stores, but sold them to Belgian [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] for 1 billion euros.

==Criminal investigation==
On 12 December 2012, Mišković was detained along with his son [[Marko Mišković|Marko]] and eight others in connection with the privatization of several public [[road maintenance]] companies in 2005 during which the suspects allegedly “gained illegal profit” of about €30 million ($38.98 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/european-business/serbias-retail-tycoon-held-in-anti-corruption-sweep/article6227845/|title=Serbia’s retail tycoon held in anti-corruption sweep|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mišković and Milo Đurašković, who was also arrested, were “co-owners in privatized road companies between 2005 and 2010” and they “usurped money and property of those companies worth about 2.87 billion dinars at the time,” Serbian Special Prosecutor for Organized Crime said in a televised statement, adding that the partnership between the two began in 2005 when Mišković’s Cyprus-based company Hemslade Trading Ltd. purchased a road maintenance company based in Belgrade for €23 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-12-12/police-arrest-serbia-s-richest-man-as-fraud-suspect|title=Police Arrest Serbia’s Richest Man as Fraud Suspect|publisher=BloombergBusinessWeek|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mišković was released from custody on 22 July 2013, after posting a [[Euro|€]]12 million bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-tycoon-miskovic-12-million-euro-bail|title=Serbia Tycoon Miskovic Pays 12 Million Euro Bail|publisher=BalkanInsight|date=22 July 2013|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 he was acquitted by the Belgrade High Court of the abuse of office charges but found guilty of aiding and abetting in tax evasion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=98366|title=Delta Holding owner found guilty of aiding tax evasion -  - on B92.net|work=B92.net|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On appeal the Appellate Court in Belgrade upheld the ruling of the first-instance court, acquitting Mišković of the abuse of office charges, but referred the case back to the first-instance court for retrial in regard to the tax evasion charges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpm.rs/appellate-court-in-belgrade-rules-in-favor-of-miskovic-in-high-profile-white-collar-crime-case/|title=The Appellate Court in Belgrade acquits Mr Miroslav Mišković {{!}} JPM Janković Popović Mitić Law Office|date=2017-09-28|work=JPM Janković Popović Mitić Law Office|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He started his career at [[Dubai Ports Authority]] and [[Jebel Ali Free Zone]], where he worked for seven years. After that, he moved to [[Singapore]] where he spent four years as Managing Director of Al Khaleej Investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.dubaiworld.ae/board-of-directors/he-mohammed-al-shaibani/|website=Dubai World|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government roles===
Since 1998 Al Shaibani has held the status of President at the Dubai Office, a private management entity for the Royal Family of Dubai. In this capacity, he represented the interests of the ruling family in London for eight years from 1999 to 2007. He currently oversees the functioning of this office from Dubai.

Mohammed Al Shaibani is also a member of the Executive Council, Government of Dubai, which was created in 2003 to support government authorities in maintaining the stability and organization of the emirate, in addition to developing its society and economy. Moreover, the Executive Council is responsible for setting and implementing the general strategy of Dubai, as well as enforcing local laws. The Council also sets the annual budget for the Government of Dubai, and ensures the smooth functioning of government bodies among other administrative duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Executive Council|url=http://www.tec.gov.ae/tec/|website=The Executive Council|publisher=Government of Dubai|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HH The Ruler's Court, Government of Dubai, in 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Ruler's Court of the Government of Dubai in Bur Dubai in 2012]]Al Shaibani also serves as the Vice Chairman of the Supreme Fiscal Committee (SFC) of Dubai since its inception in 2007. This five-man [[committee]] supervises the Dubai Financial Support Fund, which provides [[loans]] on a commercial basis to government and government-related entities that are of strategic importance to the development of the Emirate of Dubai. The SFC assesses and approves the loan criteria needed to grant the financial support to entities and projects, and reviews applications proposed by the fund's board. It also determines the size and terms of each loan as well as the nature of the related [[securities]] and [[guarantees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=John|last2=Graham|first2=Patrick|title=FACTBOX-The men behind Dubai's supreme fiscal committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/07/22/dubai-finance-idINLM18740020090722|website=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Al Shaibani was appointed Director General of The Ruler’s Court, Government of Dubai, by Emiri decree issued by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai. The Ruler’s Court or Diwan is the traditional seat of power in Dubai and various government units operate under its umbrella, such as the Department of Finance, Dubai Courts and the Executive Council, to name a few. In this role, Mohammed Al Shaibani initiated in 2008 a wave cracking down corporate corruption in Dubai.

===Business involvement===
Mohammed Al Shaibani’s strong knowledge of [[Islamic finance|Islamic financial services]] led him to be selected as Chairman of the [[Board of Directors]] of [[Dubai Islamic Bank]] (DIB) in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Al Shaibani appointed Chairman of Dubai Islamic Bank|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/Mohammed_Al_Shaibani_appointed_Chairman_of_Dubai_Islamic_Bank/29042.htm|website=UAEinteract|publisher=UAE National Media Council|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; one the U.A.E’s largest banks. [[Dubai Islamic Bank|DIB]] is also considered as the first bank in the world to apply [[Islamic]] principles in all its practices. [[File:Al Shabani at the acquisition of Dangote Cement by ICD in 2014.jpg|thumbnail|left|Al Shaibani signs with [[Aliko Dangote]] the acquisition of [[Dangote Cement]] by [[Investment Corporation of Dubai|ICD]] in 2014.]]

Such assets contribute to the growth of Dubai and range from leading [[financial services]] companies to local [[real estate]] giants, including renowned [[transportation]] and [[utilities]] corporations.

In 2010, Al Shaibani has been appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of [[Dubai World]], the government-owned holding focused on urban development. His experience as an administrator and corporate leader proved to be pivotal in the restructuring of the US$25 billion [[debt]] pile of the holding, which enabled it to return to the  international [[bond market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Lionel|last2=Khalaf|first2=Roula|last3=Kerr|first3=Simeon|title=Hard man battles to complete ‘the Task’|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/81e7416e-f0e2-11df-bf4b-00144feab49a.html|website=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|ref=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After acquiring the entertainment resort [[Atlantis, The Palm|Atlantis the Palm]] in 2013, [[ICD]] has purchased significant equity interest in the international firm that manages it, Kerzner International. This was followed by Mohammed Al Shaibani replacing [[Sol Kerzner]] as the Chairman of the international luxury hotels developer after the latter’s retirement in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Isaac|title=Dubai completes purchase of ‘significant’ Kerzner stake|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/uaebusiness/2014/april/uaebusiness_april63.xml&amp;section=uaebusiness|website=Khaleej Times|publisher=Galadari Printing and Publishing LLC|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also [[Oxford Pro Musica Singers]].''

The practical 'One Page Management System' (OPMS) has evolved to enable 'people-at-large' and experts design and implement effective systems of all kinds.

GS Chandy invented ‘One Page Management System’ (OPMS) sometime in 1981-82, based on the seminal contributions to systems science by the late John John N. Warfield - and has been developing it every since.

OPMS springs naturally from Interactive Management (IM), the powerful system methodologies that derive from Professor [[John N. Warfield]]’s “structural approach to system design”.

The application of the method also has been carried forward and codified by other entrepreneurial practitioners in worldwide applications, and an illustration of the scope of penetration of the method has recently been summarized &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harnessingcollectivewisdom.com Harness Collective Wisdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alexander Christakis]], a long-standing collaborator of Dr. [[John N. Warfield]].

Interactive Management consists of tools to:
* Help users 'generate ideas' – through systematically developed methods of brainstorming;
* ‘Structure’ (or organize) ideas generated as needed for effective resolution of problems identified.

OPMS now enables all of the above to be done by 'people-at-large' as well as by experts to create and implement truly usable systems of all kinds - individual, organisational or societal.

In brief, OPMS enables individual and group users to:

1.  Choose an appropriate 'Mission' depending on problem-situation confronted;

2.   Identify the issue or problem confronted –  this naturally provides a simple 'Mission statement';

3.  *Integrate* all the good ideas available to tackle the problem or issue at hand – with a view to enable accomplishment of the chosen Mission.  (Integrating 'good ideas' includes getting rid of the bad ideas that are always cluttering up the 'mindspace' – think about it and this will be obvious to you).

That's it!

And that's what the OPMS all about!

Just 'integrating' your available good ideas (AND getting rid of your bad ideas)!!

[Of course, it often is quite a job to decide which are the 'good' ideas and which are the 'bad' ideas – but OPMS helps users arrive at sound decisions, via effective debate between stakeholders to the chosen issue/Mission].

The structuring tools of OPMS  have developed from the powerful 'systems modeling' tools invented by Warfield in a three-decade long study of “complexity in systems and how to enable people to cope with it” - made easy to use for the 'people-at-large'.

These tools are:
* Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM); and
* Field Representation &amp; Profiling Method (FRP).
(Now rendered understandable by any high-school student within a couple of hours, and practically applicable by him/her/them to issues of practical concern within a couple of weeks [at most]).

More information about the OPMS can be sent if desired as attachments to an email message if you'll send an inquiry to gs_chandy_AT_yahoo.com - this information will include:

-- brief description of the OPMS; 
-- 'provenance'; 
-- 'Missions' to which OPMS has been successfully employed (and also some Missions where OPMS has not been successful yet; 
-- a sizable listing of possible Missions); 
-- an illustration of the kind of a systems model (and Interpretive Structural Model [ISM]), which can readily be developed into Action Planning along with all needed subsystems to help accomplish any chosen Mission.

(Limited) guidance can also be provided to help interested users initiate Action Planning on any chosen Mission - and copies of the prototype OPMS software would be freely provided - no fees or charges of any kind whatsoever.

'''Ori Yogev''' ({{lang-he-n|אורי יוגב}}; born November 3, 1960)&lt;ref name="Plastro Irrigation Systems, Report of the Appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Maya |title=Plastro Irrigation Systems Ltd |url=http://maya.tase.co.il/bursa/report.asp?report_cd=155657 |date=September 22, 2005 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] businessman who served as the appointed head of the Budget Division in the [[Finance Minister of Israel|Ministry of Finance]] between 2002 and 2004.  In 2009-2010 he was served as the Chairman of the Israel National Economic Council Advisory Committee. from 2013-2017 Yogev served at the director of the [[Government Companies Authority]]. Yogev lives in [[Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]] and is married with five children.

==Biography==
Yogev was born in [[Safed]] to parents who worked in the public sector. His father worked in the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Israel)|Department of Agriculture]] and his mother worked for the [[Tel Aviv]] Municipality. His childhood was spent in [[Haifa]] and Tel Aviv where he attended the Alliance High School. In the IDF he served as a captain in the [[Intelligence Corps (Israel)|Intelligence Corps]].

Yogev has a BA in Economics from [[Tel Aviv University]] and an MA ''[[cum laude]]'' in Economics from [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].  He began his career in the Ministry of Finance at age 26 working as a [[referent]] in the area of [[subsidies]] and government imports. Within a year, he was appointed senior adviser to the director of The Ministry of Finance, a position he held until leaving in 1990.

Between 1990 and 1993 Yogev managed the [[Jerusalem]] district as V.P of "Ha Magen" insurance company. Between 1993 and 2001 he was CEO of 'Ha'saneh' insurance company downsized. Between 1994 and 1997 he served as CEO of 'Omni Food' Brands, a '[[Domino's Pizza]]' franchise and '[[Häagen-Dazs]]'. During this period he succeeded in significantly boosting the activities of the pizzeria chain.

Between 1997 and 2001 he was CEO of '[[Bezeq International]]', a period characterized by the opening of the market to competition in international calling and the company entered the field of internet access provision.

==Ministry of Finance==
In 2002 Yogev was appointed by then Finance Minister [[Silvan Shalom]] as head of the Budget Division – the highest public sector position in the economic field. He served in this position until April 2004. His appointment coincided with a [[recession]] in Israel's economy due to the high-tech crash and the [[Second Intifada]]. The treasury worked to pass legislation for the Emergency Economic Plan, and under the leadership of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], who replaced Shalom in 2003, pursued a liberal economic policy. This included extensive cuts in government spending and comprehensive reforms. Yogev led both the drafting and implementation of these reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Avi |last=Bar-Eli |script-title=he:"נהיה הצ'ק-פוינט של המים"  |language=Hebrew |trans-title='We'll be the check point of water' |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1468278 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=he:למי מגיע הקרדיט על "התוכנית להצלת המשק"? |language=he |trans-title=Who deserves to take the credit for "the plan to rescue the economy"? |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000339486 |publisher=Globes |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure, automatic increases in governmental budgets by means of [[index (statistics)|indices]] such as linkage{{clarify|date=November 2013}} and natural population growth were revoked and replaced by a law that capped annual budget growth at 1%. [[Welfare benefits]] were linked to the CPI ([[Consumer Price Index]]) instead of an average salary, [[child benefit|child allowances]] were reduced and the budgetary pension of civil servants was replaced by a cumulative pension. The retirement age was raised, and the number of public sector workers reduced. The [[Labor Union]] ([[Histadrut]]) pension funds were also [[nationalized]]. According to Yogev, the overall plan implemented in this period was based on the approach not to harm the wealthier echelons (so that they would not leave the country),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 14, 2009 |script-title=he:אורי יוגב: אם היינו מטילים מס על העשירים הם היו בורחים |language=he |trans-title=Ori Yogev: If we impose a tax on the rich they will run away |url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.532090 |publisher=TheMarker |accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the period of recession in these years was used to promote the reduction of organized labor in the economy.&lt;ref name=Arlosoroff&gt;{{cite news |last=Arlosoroff |first=Meirav |script-title=he:"צריך לפרק את המינהל ולמכור את קרקעות המדינה" |language=he |trans-title=We must dismantle the administration and sell state lands |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.963644 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=May 5, 2004 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure, Yogev continued to serve for several months as a consultant to the treasury which led to the ports reform – a reform that he had championed during his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gad Lior |author2=Yael Gaoni |script-title=he:אורי יוגב: בעל השליטה |language=he |trans-title=Ori Yogev: In Control |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2827793,00.html |publisher=Ynet |date=December 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arlosoroff/&gt; Yogev is regarded as [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s economic ideologue.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Private business==
In 2004, Yogev began representing Australian businessman [[John Gandel]]'s investments in Israel. His activities included investment in [[Plastro Irrigation Systems]], the public company controlled by Kibbutz [[Gvat]]. Yogev was appointed as executive chairman of the company, until the Gandel Group's shares were sold to the [[John Deere]] company twenty months later.

From 2005 to 2007, working on behalf of the Kibbutz [[Lohamei HaGeta'ot]], Yogev led partnership negotiations between [[Osem (company)|Osem]] and [[Tivol]], as well as the sale of the kibbutz's stake to [[Nestlé]].

===Water technologies===
In recent years,{{when|date=November 2013}} Yogev has focused on the water and [[cleantech]] industries in Israel. Yogev founded Waterfronts – Israel Water Alliance, and continues to serve as chairman of the association. The association works to promote Israel's status as a global leader in advanced water solutions.

In 2006, he established Whitewater Holdings, operating in the field of water quality and control and investing in developing technologies to ensure the quality and safety of drinking water. Whitewater provides a comprehensive and [[synergistic]] environment, servicing municipalities in developed countries with tailored solutions. It mission is to help municipalities and water authorities guarantee a constant supply of quality water, by optimizing the production, management, control and delivery of water through the synergistic application of the latest water technologies. Following the realization of his holdings in Plastro, Yogev purchased Gandel's part in the company and brought in businesswoman Hanna Gertler as a partner.

Whitewater Holdings has three subsidiaries: Whitewater Technologies (integrated management, optimization and analytics), which holds a daughter company located in [[Akron]] USA, Galcon (smart irrigation and pressure management) and CheckLight (toxicity analyzer).

In April 2013, Whitewater Technologies was chosen by Bloomberg as one of 10 companies named the 2013 New Energy Pioneer. A team of independent experts chose the ten winning companies from over 200 candidates, in the energy, water and clean-tech sector. The selection committee stated the winners as "representing the technology and business model innovation which will enable the transformation to a more resource efficient economy environment". The selection was made based on three criteria – innovation, proven momentum in its field and potential for global deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sharon Udasin |title=Israeli firm named Bloomberg New Energy Pioneer |url=http://www.jpost.com/Enviro-Tech/Israeli-firm-named-Bloomberg-New-Energy-Pioneer-311155 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=April 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whitewater Technologies Selected as 2013 New Energy Pioneer |url=http://www.w-water.com/Content.aspx?id=162 |publisher=Whitewater |date=April 2013 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Chairman of the National Economic Council Advisory Committee and Chairman of [[Israel Railways]]==
In 2009, Yogev was appointed as Chairman of National Economic Council Advisory Committee and to the Prime Minister and lead the financial program and the Package deal with the Israeli Labor Union (Histadrut).
  
In that year, The Marker magazine ranked Yogev ninth in its list of the most influential people in the Israeli economy, based on his tenure as a consultant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Chairman of the National Economic Advisory Council and to the Prime Minister).

=== Chairman of Israel Railways ===
In 2010 Yogev became one of the architects of the 'Israel Ways' program for massive development of the Israel Railways' infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gutman |first=Lior |title=תוכנית נתניהו-יוגב יוצאת לדרך: 51 מיליארד שקל יושקעו ברשת רכבות וכבישים |language=he |trans-title= The Netanyahu-Yogev Plan is underway: 51 billion NIS will be invested in a network of trains and roads |url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3390908,00.html |newspaper=Calcalist |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hazelkorn |first=Shahar |title=The train is doing a u-turn: The CEO who resigned is back |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340L-3899868'00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218010640/http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340L-3899868'00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 18, 2013 |publisher=Ynet |date=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was approved by the Netanyahu government, and Yogev was appointed as chairman of its Advisory Committee and chairman of the Railway Board till mid 2013.
During his tenure as a Chairman, a profound change of personnel structure took place and the Chairman of committee, Gila Edrei, was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hazani |first=Golan |script-title=he:אורי יוגב: "נכפיל את מספר נוסעי הרכבת בשנים הקרובות" |language=he |trans-title=Ori Yogev: "We will multiply the number of train passengers in the coming years |url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3477442,00.html |newspaper=Calcalist |date=January 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General Manager of the Government Companies Authority ==
from September 2013 to September 2017 Yogev served as the general manager of the Government Companies Authority.

In his capacity as director of the Government Companies Authority, Yogev initiated the reform in government companies. The purpose of the reform, which is based on the [[OECD]]'s concept of managing government companies, is to transform government companies into a property for them, while improving the efficiency and level of service they provide to citizens in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gca.gov.il/NR/RDONLYRES/84FBA233-475E-43D2-AEB2-2B9E53159AD9/0/%D7%A4%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%AA.PDF|title=Report on the activity of the Government Companies Authority for 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government companies that lost NIS 600 million in 2013 went to an aggregate profit of NIS 2.6 billion in 2016 and are expected to earn more than NIS 3 billion in 2017, with all major government companies earning the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1001205389|title=החברות הממשלתיות הרוויחו ב-2017 כ-730 מיליון שקל|website=Globes|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the Directors' team was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarker.com/career/1.2649836|title=נבחרת הדירקטורים 2015: 50% נשים ו-10% ערבים|last=חרותי-סובר|first=טלי|date=2015-06-02|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was aimed at ending the political involvement in government companies.

For the 2014 team came 13,795 candidates, of whom 500 were selected finalists. About 7,100 candidates went to the 2015 team, of whom the 500 finalists recommended to government ministers were located. The number of directors of 2017 was 9,266, of which 400 candidates were added to the 500 candidates from the previous year's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarker.com/career/1.3900081|title=9,266 אנשים הגישו מועמדות לנבחרת הדירקטורים 2017|last=חרותי-סובר|first=טלי|date=2017-03-01|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the 250 elected directors are the elected candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarker.com/career/1.4271120|title=הסתיים הליך איתור נבחרת הדירקטורים ל-2017|last=חרותי-סובר|first=טלי|date=2017-07-18|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the establishment of the Directors' team, the number of women represented on boards of directors has risen to fifty percent. In addition, ten percent of directors belong to minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/markerweek/1.3112018|title=אני יודע שצפויים עוד מהלכים של להב 433 בחברות הממשלתיות|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report prepared by the Government Companies Authority indicated that since the establishment of the directors' team, the percentage of family members in government companies has fallen by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3679966,00.html|title=הקלף של אורי יוגב: רשות החברות צמצמה העסקת מקורבים|date=2016-02-02|work=כלכליסט - www.calcalist.co.il|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macro Economics Doctrine==
Yogev supports extensive scaling back and [[privatization]] of the [[public sector]] as well as the transfer of government controlled activities and assets to the [[private sector]]. According to this approach, the state should buy services (including [[social services]] and education) from private companies rather than provide them. Yogev aggressively opposes the existence of [[monopolies]], including [[government monopolies]], and has called for the dismantling of the [[Israel Lands Administration]] and the transfer of land in its possession to private ownership. In addition, the breaking of the monopoly of the largest [[commercial banks]]. However, he declared that even a privately owned monopoly is preferable to a government-controlled entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Tani |script-title=he:אורי יוגב: נמאס לי לעבוד בתור שכיר |language=he |trans-title=Ori Yogev: I'm tired of working as a salaried worker |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2912187,00.html |publisher=Ynet |date=May 5, 2004 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yogev was responsible for drastically cutting allowances in the first decade of the 21st century, but also for supporting the Wisconsin plan encouraging work by reducing benefits, and investment in the transportation infrastructure. He called for the cancellation of the collective agreements with teachers and for enabling school administrators to hire teachers with private contracts and to purchase teaching services from private companies. He supported the separation of water and sewage departments of local authorities, and the establishment of independent water and sewage corporations.

Yogev is aggressively opposed to the existence of [[organized labor]], and sees it as a burden on the economy and the leading cause of mediocrity and lack of professionalism. He said that there is no need for organized labor in Israel, since the state takes responsibility for maintaining the rights of employees, while the Labour Union mainly protects the major labor committees, but not workers in small companies and businesses.

The definition of a partnership does not vary across [[jurisdiction]]s, with each definition encompassing the following criteria in determining the existence of a partnership:
* '''Valid agreement''' between the parties;
* '''To carry on a business''' – as opposed to a single or isolated transaction, which suggests a [[Joint venture]].;
* '''In common''' – meaning there must be some mutuality of rights, agency, interests and obligations;
* '''View to profit''' – partnerships must form with a view to profit. Other business structures such as [[Charitable organization|charities]] and sporting clubs do not seek to share profits and liabilities, and are thus treated differently under each state jurisdiction's respective Associations Incorporation Act.

==Who is a partner?==
As to whether any given person involved with a company is a 'partner', guidance is found in s.6 of the Act. Several rules are given. The most common are as follows:
*''Joint-ownership'':
Rule 1 – s.6(1)provides that there must be joint-ownership. This is rather self-explanatory but the mere fact that persons may be joint-tenants or have part ownership do not in themselves create a partnership. Typically, where the rules below point towards a partnership, such would generally satisfy this rule.
*''Participating in gross returns'':
Generally speaking, 'partners' must share gross-returns each according to their share in the business. Thus at first instance, if persons share the gross-returns, one would be inclined to say that a partnership exists. However, rule 2- s.6(2) complicates this. It provides that the sharing of gross returns will not in itself create a partnership.

All this notwithstanding, sharing of gross-returns is a strong indication of a partnership – particularly where a set percentage is prescribed in the agreement.
*''Sharing of profits'':
Rule 3- s 6(3) provides that the sharing of profits is prima facie evidence that a partnership exists. However, this is not categorical. To cite two examples where a person entitled to a share was not a partner is where that such person is a creditor or by virtue of s.6(3)(b) where that 'sharing of profits' is simply remuneration or a wage. Note in the latter example, s.28(6) provides that although partners are not entitled to remuneration – and thus he who receives remuneration is prima facie not a partner – this may be varied by partnership agreement. Therefore, receiving remuneration does not conclusively indicate against a partnership.
*''Sharing of losses'':
Rule 3 – s6(3) also concerns sharing of profits. Section 28 explains that all partners must contribute equally to firm’s losses.
    
*''Exercise partner’s rights'':
Generally, where a person exercises those rights that would typically be exercised by a true partner, the more likely a partnership can be imputed. Section 28 includes a non-exhaustive list of partner’s rights.

The most common partners rights are the right to participate in the firms management (s.28(5)) (which can be illustrated by attending meetings) and the right to access the firm's books and confidential financial reports (s.28(9)). A partner without the right to participate in the firms management is often referred to as a ''silent partner''.

But, at the end of the day there is flexibility in the partnership agreement and it is possible for the partners to consensually agree to exclude one or more of these partner's rights in relation to any given partner. Thus, put simply, the mere fact a person does not exercise these rights does not indicate categorically that they are not a partner.

==Partner's liability==
Perhaps the most important question for any partner is 'what is my liability under this arrangement'.

In essence, the liability of a partner (or even a non-partner who was 'held out' to be a partner ''see below'') is significantly large. Every partner or person held out to be a partner is both an agent and principal of the firm and may thus bind the firm and the partners: s.9. Simply, each partner is his brother's proverbial keeper and will be responsible both legally and financially for the actions of the other partners in the general course of business.

To give a clear example, where one partner acts negligently and there is no indemnity insurance (or the indemnity insurer refuses to cover the loss), the liability of all partners will be joint and several: s.16. The cause of major distress for partners arises where the other partners become insolvent. The weight of total liability would rest on the solvent partners. Thus put simply, even if a person only had a 25% partner's share, he or she would be responsible for covering all 100% (potentially exorbitantly exceeding their investment) of the damage arising from the negligence if the other partners do not have the means to pay.

As alluded to above, the issue of "holding out", which is discussed in s.18(1) of the Act, is particularly relevant. "Holding out" refers to where a non-partner advertises himself ''or'' alternatively is advertised to the world as being a partner. This advertising can be either explicit and/or implicit

For example, where the firm permits a non-partner to 'sign off' on company accounts or documents or where a non-partner has an office next to the partner's or even enjoys the perks of the true partners, these are implicit indication to the world that the non-partner is actually a partner. To exemplify express indications, this would occur where a non-partner has his name on the company letter-head or to go even further, actively introduces himself as a partner.

Not only may the non-partner be held to be liable as a partner, the true partners will also be liable for the non-partners actions just as they would be for the actions of a true partner. This is provided that the relevant third-party was reasonably unaware of the non-partner's true position in the business and the conduct on the non-partner could be described as in the ordinary course of business. These two are generally part and parcel as if the transaction is not in the ordinary course of business, then the less likely it is that a third party would genuinely believe that the non-partner was a partner.

==Limited partnership==
Limited Partnerships are governed by Part III of the Act. The paramount characteristic of such a partnership is that a limited partner's liability will be ''limited'': See s.49(1) definition.

Section 60(1) indicates that the liability of limited partner limited to amount shown in Register (Register of Limited Partnerships, ''see'' s. 57). Typically, a limited partner would make a contribution to the capital or assets of the partnership. An interpretation of s.60(2) suggests that the limited partner's liability would not exceed the contribution made or promised.

Other key points to note are that:
* A limited partner can not take part in the management of the business of the limited partnership: s.67(1). If he or she does so, they will be liable as general partners by virtue of s.67(2).

==Dissolution of a Partnership==
Dissolution of a partnership occurs when there is a change in the relationship of the partners, as a result of a partner ceasing to be associated or a part of carrying on the business. Situations which can be a catalyst for dissolution are

* '''Action by partners''' – taking the form of either the notice of dissolution of a previously indefinite partnership agreement which is given by a partner which is agreed to by the other partners, or when the partners agree to dissolve the partnership after the termination of a single or multiple undertakings. An example of the latter would be the partners' prior agreement an expiration date (though the partners may at will choose to continue the partnership after a pre-agreed expiration date if they so choose). Any such action to dissolve the partnership by partners is a grounds for automatic dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s32.html|title=PARTNERSHIP ACT 1892 – SECT 32 – Dissolution by expiration or otherwise|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Operation of law''' – the partnership may be dissolved in the event of a partner's death or bankruptcy, so long as the other partner(s) agree to the dissolution. Operation of law is also grounds for automatic dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s33.html|title=PARTNERSHIP ACT 1892 – SECT 33 – Dissolution by bankruptcy, death, or change|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illegality''' – a partnership is automatically dissolved when an event renders the purpose of the partnership illegal or against public policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s34.html|title=PARTNERSHIP ACT 1892 – SECT 34 – Dissolution by illegality of partnership|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''By the court''' – when none of the automatic grounds for dissolution listed above are present, one or more partners may apply for dissolution through a court. Examples include insanity, permanent incapacity, one partner's conduct which a court finds detrimental to the business, wilful or persistent breach of the partnership agreement, or whenever a court finds dissolution of the partnership to be just and equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s35.html|title=PARTNERSHIP ACT 1892 – SECT 35 – Dissolution by the Court|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pavel Tykač''' (born 15 May 1964 in [[Čelákovice]]) is a [[Czech people|Czech]] entrepreneur and investor with long-term experience in the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/tykac-je-pripraven-investovat-miliardu-eur-na-energetickem-trhu/1589379&lt;/ref&gt; At present, he is the sole owner of Sev.en Energy Group, a major player in the Czech energy market which is planning to expand to the European energy market.&lt;ref&gt;https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-66056680-miliardar-tykac-planuje-velkou-expanzi-po-evrope-chce-kupovat-uhelne-i-plynove-elektrarny&lt;/ref&gt; His wealth is estimated at US$1.03 billion, which according to [[Forbes]] magazine makes him the fifth richest person in the [[Czech Republic]] (Forbes rankings 2015).&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/pavel-tykac/?list=billionaires|title=Pavel Tykac|author=Agustino Fontevecchia|work=Forbes|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his wife, Pavel Tykač is significantly engaged in charity projects and support for the North Bohemian Region and the Pardubice Region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euro.cz/archiv/financnik-tykac-se-dal-na-dobrocinnost-1255048&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-politika/355432/5-nejbohatsi-muz-v-cesku-tykac-zaplatil-novou-porodnici-vedeli-jste-ze-ma-8-deti.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7.cz/cz/promedia/aktuality/tz/2017/20170502.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavel Tykač started his entrepreneurial career after the Revolution by sale of computer technology. In the beginning of the 90s he and his partners established Vikomt company which had a great break through on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uh|title = Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank. Teď o uhlí|date = 2010-12-14|website = Hospodářské noviny|language = cs-CZ|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold his share of the company in the middle of the 90s. He used the acquired money to buy at the time small Regiobanka in [[Karlovy Vary]] (today`s Hypoteční banka); he subsequently sold it to IPB at a very advantageous price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.penize.cz/akcie/15460-tykac-vs-takac|title = Tykač vs. Takáč {{!}} Peníze.cz|website = www.penize.cz|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already at that time he was considered to be a very rich man. In 1995 he participated in the creation of free community of investors around Motoinvest whose participants gained shares in several banks and investment funds thanks to buying cheap shares after the privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://janmachacek.webgarden.cz/rubriky/homepage/respekt/ja-na-to-nemel-nervy|title = Respekt|last = Macháček|first = Jan|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced termination of their activities has led to the rapid sale of assets of the majority of participants in this community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uhli|title = Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank.

Share trades (mainly electricity company [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] and Telefónica) and currency rate movement speculations are probably the biggest source of Tykač`s billion-dollar assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/byznys/cesko/pavel-tykac-nakupuje-akcie-unipetrolu-a-telefoniky_52426.html|title = Pavel Tykač nakupuje akcie Unipetrolu a Telefóniky|last = webmaster@tyden.cz|first = TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date = 2008-04-06|website = TÝDEN.cz|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, he entered the energy sector by investing in a minority stake in the Czech Coal mining group. In 2010, he became its sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/novi-uhlobaroni-v-moste-0ss-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A060516_210147_ekoakcie_zra&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, Pavel Tykač significantly developed the company in the energy sector and, primarily, invested in the know-how in assets and energy market. In 2013, he bought the Chvaletice Power Station, creating a new entity in the domestic energy market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investicniweb.cz/news-2013-9-2-severni-energeticka-je-vlastnikem-elektrarny-chvaletice/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he completed a commercially successful period with several major contracts, rebranding Czech Coal to Sev.en Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://iuhli.cz/od-noveho-roku-vznikne-skupina-severni-energeticka/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he decided to enter the European energy market through the emerging Sev.en Energy (SE) holding, which relies on renowned experts. The new company will focus on investing in innovative technologies in energy, as well as in operating and innovating conventional resources that will enable European energy systems to switch to renewable resources in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66057540-konec-neobnovitelnych-zdroju-prijde-pozdeji-nez-si-politici-naplanovali-rika-pavel-tykac-do-elektraren-v-evrope-chce-investovat-desitky-miliard&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Tykač studied at the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] where he obtained an [[engineer's degree]] in 1987.

== Career ==

After completing military service, he worked as a technician in the TOS Čelákovice. In 1990 he started to import and sell computer equipment, and later, in 1991, he founded Vikomt company with three other partners, which became one of the top three companies on the market in the first half of the nineties

In 1995 he sold his share and used the money (up to one billion dollars) to take over a small Regiobanka in [[Hradec Králové|Hradec Kralove]], which he subsequently sold to IPB. IPB transformed it into Czechomoravian mortgage bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.penize.cz/akcie/15460-tykac-vs-takac|title=Tykač vs. Takáč {{!}} Peníze.cz|website=www.penize.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds from this transaction were the source for his further activities.

Tykač gained a significant portion of his assets while trading with shares of the coupon privatization in the nineties. He participated in the creation of a free group of people and companies around Motoinvest (brokerage house) which the media later called "the Motoinvest group".  The group shared common vision of the emergence of strong Czech financial and industrial group. Individual members of this group were massively buying shares from small shareholders during the privatization. Thanks to these activities the group gained shares in a number of large investment funds (e.g. funds managed by [[Komerční banka]], [[Československá obchodní banka|ČSOB]], Živnobanka, [[C. S. Fondy a.s.|CS Funds]], Creditanstalt or [[PPF (company)|PPF]]), several banks (Credit banka Plzeň, Agrobanka) and many other major companies (e.g. Slovácké Machinery, Gravel and sand pits of Olomouc, ...).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://janmachacek.webgarden.cz/rubriky/homepage/respekt/ja-na-to-nemel-nervy|title=Respekt|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1996, after the purchase of a significant share in the then state-majority-owned [[Česká spořitelna]] and an attempt to gain influence and position among its authorities a hard clash between "group [[Motoinvest]]" on one side and the ČNB together with the then largest banks (Czech Savings Bank, Commercial Bank, ČSOB) on the other started blazing. The result was a forced administration of Agrobanka by ČNB. This forced investors around Motoinvest to a rapid sale of their assets; it caused their forced departure from the Czech capital market and extinction of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uhli|title=Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank. Teď o uhlí|date=2010-12-14|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the new millennium, after several years in seclusion, Tykač started to invest into equities on the Prague Stock Exchange and speculative trading in foreign currencies. He was trading with shares of Telefónica or Czech Radiokomunikace, but his best-known business has been a massive purchase of [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] shares at a time, when one share cost less than 100 CZK. Within a few years he was able to sell the same share for more than 1000 CZK. He was sure that ČEZ fusion with various regional distributors into "SuperČEZ" will result into a significant increase in the value of the investments in a relatively short time. According to some sources, he earned up to ten billion CZK solely on this transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/byznys/cesko/pavel-tykac-nakupuje-akcie-unipetrolu-a-telefoniky_52426.html|title=Pavel Tykač nakupuje akcie Unipetrolu a Telefóniky|last=webmaster@tyden.cz|first=TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date=2008-04-06|website=TÝDEN.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he was involved in securing funding for the company EC Group, which won the tender for the purchase of receivables from the Czech Consolidation Agency in the nominal amount of 38 billion CZK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfcr.cz/cs/archiv/transformacni-instituce/agenda-byvale-cka/komunikace-cka-archiv/tiskove-zpravy-cka/2002/blok-pohledavek-ceske-konsolidacni-agent-15639|title=Blok pohledávek České konsolidační agentury odkoupí společnost EC Group|website=Ministerstvo financí České republiky|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) has been called the "bad bank" of the state, into which the problem loans from the privatization of large banks after debt relief were redirected. EC Group, which was then owned by former collaborators of Pavel Tykač Jan Dienstl and Pavel Šimek paid 3.4 billion CZK for a package of receivables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/dienstlova-klicka-804776|title=Dienstlova klička|date=2003-09-26|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; The group overpayed such renowned consortiums as Goldman Sachs / Flow East or PPF / CS First Boston, by about half a billion CZK. In 2003, the EC Group sued ČKA and demanded the return of about 570 mil CZK against portions of the claims that ČKA never owned due to legal shortcomings and therefore the claims could not even be sold. ČKA eventually returned about 440 mil CZK based on a judicial verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/cka-zlobi-sobotku-804185|title=ČKA zlobí Sobotku|date=2003-11-21|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;

In 2006 Tykač invested via a [[Cyprus]] company Indoverse Investment Limited into a minority share of the mining group Czech Coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/novi-uhlobaroni-v-moste-0ss-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A060516_210147_ekoakcie_zra|title=Noví uhlobaroni v Mostě|date=2006-05-17|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010 Indoverse Investment Limited became the sole 100% owner of the Czech Coal group.

The Czech Coal Group is one of the leading mining and energy groups in the Czech Republic. Its core business is the production and sale of coal, sale of electricity and heat production. In the region of northern Bohemia, in which the group operates, they are one of the largest employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-09|title=Czech Coal|url=https://cs.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Czech_Coal&amp;oldid=13125103|journal=Wikipedie|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2013 Litvínovská uhelná a. s., which operates a ČSA mine and Chvaletice power plant purchased from the ČEZ group, separated from the Czech Coal group. This business move created a new group on the market called Severní energetická, in which Tykač owns a 40% share.

== Criminal investigations ==

Tykač is the effective owner of [[Czech Coal Group|Czech Coal]] with 50% of its shares. He originally purchased a 40% share in the company in spring 2006 and then quickly increased that share to 49% for allegedly nearly CZK 10 billon.&lt;ref name="Tykac"&gt;Hospodařský noviny, 3 September 2009. “Moves among the coal barons. Financier Tykač now owns exactly half of Czech Coal [http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-38214500-pohyb-mezi-uhlobarony-financnik-tykac-uz-vlastni-presnou-polovinu-czech-coal] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Tykač purchased the additional 1% from his partners Petr Pudil and Vasil Bobela in 2009.&lt;ref name="Tykac" /&gt;

Apart from his holding in Czech Coal, Tykač  also operates on the real estate and financial markets. He has been described as “a person with the reputation of an unscrupulous player and a secretive pirate of Czech business comparable to [[Gordon Gekko]] …, professing greed as the highest virtue”.&lt;ref name="pirate"&gt;Lidový noviny, 19 October 2011. “Roman wants to destroy the pirate of Czech business. Who is Pavel Tykač?” [http://byznys.lidovky.cz/romana-chce-znicit-pirat-ceskeho-byznysu-kdo-je-pavel-tykac-p4f-/firmy-trhy.asp?c=A111019_100938_firmy-trhy_nev] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

His earlier activities on the financial market in the 1990s included the acquisition of CS Fund, the asset manager of three smaller investment funds, which Tykač divested himself of just a few weeks before it was ‘tunneled’ or defrauded in March 1997.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt; The most valuable acquisition of his investment company, Motoinvest, established in 1991, however, was [[Agrobanka]]. It was this company that financed most of Tykač’s activities, which before long led it to the brink of ruin as the bank was unable to meet its liabilities, leading to the intervention the Czech National Bank to rescue its clients by pumping CZK 20 billion into it.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt; Tykač also acquired shares through Motoinvest in other banks whose capital was subsequently passed on to companies and funds linked to Tykač whereupon those banks also went bankrupt as a result of these transactions, e.g. [[Kreditní banka Plzeň]], and [[Ekoagrobanka]]. As a result, he is often called "the pest of the capital market" in the Czech Republic, an appellation which he failed to have the Czech courts prohibit the magazine [[Respekt]] from using in connection with his person.&lt;ref&gt;Spurný, J., Účet pro Pavla Tykače [A bill for Pavel Tykač], Respekt, 13 August 2006 [http://respekt.ihned.cz/c1-36279580-ucet-pro-pavla-tykace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tykač was investigated by the police in 2006 over the tunneling of CS Fund, but the prosecution was later suspended. Many of his former associates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/339191-soud-ulozil-makleri-z-kauzy-cs-fondu-podminku.html|title=Soud uložil makléři z kauzy CS fondů podmínku|work=novinky.cz|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been convicted of financial crimes and have often ended up behind bars, although Tykač himself has always remained at liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/192328-tykac-bude-kvuli-cs-fondum-znovu-stihan/|title=Tykač bude kvůli CS Fondům znovu stíhán|author=Česká televize|work=ČT24|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations against him, however, continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-61650180-tykac-se-stihani-v-kauze-cs-fondu-nevyhne-valkova-zrusila-stiznost-sve-predchudkyne|title=Tykač se stíhání v kauze CS Fondů nevyhne. Válková zrušila stížnost své předchůdkyně|work=Hospodářské noviny|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, František Bušek alleged in court that he assisted Tykač in defrauding CS Fund of CZK 1.23 billion. Tykač said the allegation was the result of an earlier failed attempt by Bušek to blackmail him.&lt;ref&gt;Lidový noviny, 29 February 2012.“I tunnelled CS Fund with Tykač, says court witness [http://www.lidovky.cz/tuneloval-jsem-s-tykacem-cs-fondy-oznamil-soudu-svedek-pg2-/ln_domov.asp?c=A120229_144525_ln_domov_spa] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Tykač kept a very low profile from the late 1990s only to re-emerge in 2006 with his purchase of shares in [[Czech Coal Group|Czech Coal]], since when he has aggressively defended the price demands of the company and lobbied for the cancellation of the [[brown coal mining limits in North Bohemia]], beyond which lie huge coal reserves.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt;

Further examples of Tykač’s alleged unscrupulousness include posting letters to the wives of shareholders who were refusing to sell him a Czech Coal competitor, Sokolovské uhelné,  urging them to talk their husbands into the deal, and the way he dealt with a run-down but listed residence he owned in the exclusive Prague quarter of Vinohrady – it mysteriously caught fire twice and was eventually demolished without permission.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt;

== Involvement into the energy sector ==

=== Ending coal war with the ČEZ group ===

At the turn of 2012-13, as the owner of Czech Coal, Tykač ended the so-called coal war about the price of brown coal with the [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] group. Eight years of conflict, which began even before Tykač joined the coal business, was terminated by a mutual agreement of the parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/cez-se-dohodl-s-tykacem-nakoupi-uhli-za-skoro-200-miliard-966841|title=ČEZ se dohodl s Tykačem, nakoupí uhlí za skoro 200 miliard|date=2013-03-18|website=E15.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by signing a 50-year contract about coal supply to the power plant [[Počerady]].

=== Hard clash with EPH because of power plant Opatovice ===

In 2012 Tykač`s Czech Coal terminated the contract for the supply of coal to the power plant [[Opatovice I|Opatovice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-56072400-uhelna-valka-miliardaru-se-vyhrocuje-czech-coal-vypovedel-smlouvu-elektrarne-opatovice|title=Uhelná válka miliardářů se vyhrocuje. Czech Coal vypověděl smlouvu elektrárně Opatovice|date=2012-06-07|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belongs to the Energy and Industrial Holding (EPH) owned by [[Daniel Křetínský|Křetínský]] and JT Bank. Tykač justified this step by EPH having claims of half a billion CZK. The conflict between Czech Coal and EPH ended with amicable settlement in 2014. Part of the deal was the mutual termination of litigation.

=== The dispute with Sokolovská uhelná ===

Since 2006 Tykač supported the minority shareholder of Sokolov coal company Jan Kroužecký in his conflict with the majority shareholders. Subsequent litigation lasted for years. In 2015 the whole issue ended in an agreement when Kroužecký sold his shares to the company, that was now completely controlled by its majority shareholders František Štěpánek and Jaroslav Rokos. The price of Kroužecký`s 30% share of the company was supposedly around 4-5 billion CZK. There are speculations that most of this money was received by Tykač, who had previously bought Kroužecký`s share. Only Štěpánek publicly addressed ending of the dispute by saying that the company bought Kroužecký`s share, there was a longstanding dispute settlement and that the parties consider the transaction to be positive and beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-64039900-konec-sporu-o-sokolovskou-uhelnou-firmu-plne-ovladli-stepanek-a-rokos-vydela-i-tykac|title=Konec sporů o Sokolovskou uhelnou: Firmu plně ovládli Štěpánek a Rokos, vydělá i Tykač|date=2015-05-20|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The case with Respekt ===

In 2013 weekly magazine [[Respekt]] published an information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://respekt.ihned.cz/c1-59515860-drobni-miliardari-placte|title=Drobní miliardáři, plačte!|last=Spurný|first=Jaroslav|website=respekt.ihned.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the alleged freezing of Tykač`s assets of roughly 19 bil CZK by Swiss claimants. This should have occurred due to the renewed prosecution in the case of stripped assets of [[C. S. Fondy a.s.|CS Funds]] in the Czech Republic. Tykač denied any blocking of his assets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/1110919-svycari-meli-zmrazit-tykacovi-19-miliard-podnikatel-poprel|title=Švýcaři měli zmrazit Tykačovi 19 miliard, podnikatel to popřel|last=televize|first=Česká|website=ČT24|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a statement that it is a deliberate or unconscious attempt to prevent the signing of a contract between ČEZ and Czech Coal about a long-term supply of coal to power plant Počerady.

=== Tykač and the CS Funds ===

One of the media monitored cases associated with Pavel Tykač are the CS Funds. 1,3 bil CZK was fraudulently withdrawn from the funds in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/1997/12/z-c-s-fondu-se-ztratila-vice-nez-miliarda|title=Z C.

The prosecution of Tykač and other three suspects was terminated after a review by the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office in 2008 with the conclusion that the conduct of these persons in connection with CS Funds had not been a criminal offense.&lt;ref name="ceskapozice.lidovky.cz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/divoka-leta-s-cs-fondy-0ty-/tema.aspx?c=A150210_011449_pozice-tema_kasa|title=Česká pozice {{!}} Informace pro svobodné lidi|date=2015-02-15|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two suspects were indicted in the same year, but were subsequently freed by the Municipal Court in [[Prague]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/nezastavil-kradez-miliardy-nyni-chce-odskodne-8-milionu/r~8049859c9b3311e4a7d8002590604f2e/|title=Nezastavil krádež miliardy, nyní chce odškodné devět milionů|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte co se právě děje|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tykač prosecuted again because of the CS Funds ===

Tykač`s involvement in the money withdrawal from the CS Funds became a subject of criminal prosecution again in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/290317-soud-obnovil-stihani-miliardare-tykace.html|title=Soud obnovil stíhání miliardáře Tykače|website=Novinky.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; when criminal proceedings against him were resumed. New facts that led to the restoration of the process were represented by a particularly dubious testimony of people who either changed their testimony or refused to testify in the retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/archiv/dlouha-tykacova-nocni-mura-vypoved-tunelare-ve-vysluzbe-stacit-nebude-1184310|title=Dlouhá Tykačova noční můra: Výpověď tuneláře ve výslužbě stačit nebude|date=2015-05-10|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this testimony, the police and the prosecution tried to secure Tykač`s property twice. In both cases the court found the decision as unjustified and it was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/soud-odblokoval-tykacovi-majetek-za-100-milionu-korun-f9t-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A130814_134546_ekonomika_fih|title=Soud odblokoval Tykačovi majetek za 102 milionů korun|date=2013-08-14|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 the police investigation ended after two and a half years with a recommendation for indictment submitted to the Chief Prosecutor's Office in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/1522422-policie-navrhla-obzalovat-tykace-z-vytunelovani-cs-fondu|title=Policie navrhla obžalovat Tykače z vytunelování CS Fondů|last=televize|first=Česká|website=ČT24|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tykač is innocent ==
In December 2015 the High Prosecutor's Office in Prague terminated the prosecution against Tykač.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/tykacovi-obhajci-zastaveni-jsme-cekali-svedci-byli-neverohodni_367129.html|title=Tykačovi obhájci: Zastavení jsme čekali, svědci byli nevěrohodní|last=webmaster@tyden.cz|first=TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date=2015-12-29|website=TÝDEN.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; State prosecutor Zdeněk Matula stated in the preamble that no evidence of Tykač`s guilt had been found. This verdict thus ended 19 years of CS Funds cause. In his interview for [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] in 2014 Tykač stated that, in his opinion, the money from the funds disappeared during the management of its new owners, to whom the funds were sold by the Motoinvest group after pressure caused by a hostile attack of ČNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iuhli.cz/forbesovske-ohlednuti-tykac-ve-verzi-2014/3/|title=Forbesovské ohlédnutí: Tykač ve verzi 2014 {{!}} iUHLI.cz {{!}} Page 3|date=2015-12-01|website=iUHLI.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a wave of inspections of tax authorities, the Stock Exchange, Securities Office, a wave of police interrogations and strongly negative media atmosphere directed against "Motoinvest group".&lt;ref name="ceskapozice.lidovky.cz"/&gt;

=== Support of the North Bohemia region ===

Through his company Czech Coal and Vršanská uhelná Tykač supports number of projects and activities related to the region in northern Bohemia, for example, a grant program to support education called Clever Heads for the North,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kr-ustecky.cz/chytre-hlavy-pro-sever-2015/d-1689624|title=Chytré hlavy pro Sever 2015: Environmentální výchova, vzdělání a osvěta (EVVO): Ústecký kraj|website=www.kr-ustecky.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top club of Women Handball DHK Baník Most, he also supports municipalities in the region, an example is his investment into the reconstruction of the Most hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mostecky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/miliardar-tykac-a-modelka-erbova-si-prohledli-vylepsenou-mosteckou-porodnici-20151112.html|title=Miliardář Tykač a modelka Erbová si prohlédli vylepšenou mosteckou porodnici|date=2015-11-12|website=Mostecký deník|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for single parents ===

Together with his second wife Ivana Tykač established a non-profit organization Women for Women that is helping women and single mothers with children who find themselves in difficult circumstances and can not solve them on their own. The organization provides them with subsidized housing, psychosocial and legal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.women-for-women.cz|title=WOMEN FOR WOMEN, o.p.s.|last=(m.vitasek@seznam.cz)|first=Michal Vitásek|website=www.women-for-women.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School meals for starving children ===

Women for Women, o.p.s. is the initiator and operator of the Czech largest award-winning project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-64855470-kazdy-desaty-skolak-nema-penize-na-obed-varuje-ocenena-reklama|title=Každý desátý školák nemá peníze na oběd, varuje oceněná reklama|date=2015-11-12|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides school meals to starving children in Czech elementary schools - Lunches for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obedyprodeti.cz|title=Domů {{!}} Obědy pro děti|website=www.obedyprodeti.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project fed nearly 2,100 children in almost 500 schools during the 2014/2015 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tn.nova.cz/clanek/tisice-ceskych-deti-hladovi-rodice-nemaji-na-obedy-ve-skole.html|title=Budou děti o hladu?

== Family and personal life ==

'''Socialist Workers' Sport International''' ({{lang-de|Sozialistische Arbeitersport Internationale}}, SASI) was an international [[socialist]] sporting organisation, based in [[Lucerne]]. It was founded in 1920, and consisted of six national federations (with a combined membership of about one million) at the time of its foundation. Initially it was known as '''International Association for Sports and Physical Culture'''. Informally it was known as the '''Lucerne Sport International'''. It adopted the name SASI in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Bruce. The Struggle for Canadian Sport. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxist]] [[Julius Deutsch]] was the president of SASI.&lt;ref name="wheel"/&gt;

[[International Labour Sports Federation]] (CSIT) was established in 1946 as the successor of SASI.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] &amp; [[James Riordan]] (eds.) (1996). ''The Story of Worker Sport.''

==Foundation==

An international meeting of workers sports associations had been held in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], in 1913. However, the [[First World War]] put the build-up of an international workers' sport organisation on hold. After the war two Belgians, Gaston Bridoux and Jules Devlieger, took initiative to revive the cooperation. Preparatory meetings were held in [[Seraing]], [[Belgium]] in 1919 and in [[Paris]], [[France]], during Easter 1920. The founding congress of the international took place in Lucerne September 13-September 14, 1920. During the foundation, the French and Belgian delegations urged that the word 'Socialist' be omitted from the name of the organisation, in order to attract a broader following.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Steinberg, David A.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/260115 The Workers' Sport Internationals 1920&amp;ndash;28]'', in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 13, No. 2, Special Issue: Workers' Culture (Apr., 1978), pp. 233&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

The organisation upheld a policy of neutrality towards party organisations, a policy inherited from the German workers' sports movement (which tried to steer away from the fractional conflicts between the German socialists). This policy was however challenged by the communists, which claimed that the workers' sport movement could not abstain from taking part in revolutionary struggle. In 1921, the third congress of the [[Communist International]] decided to form a parallel sport international. In August 1921, the [[Sportintern]] was founded. [[Sportintern]] launched fierce political attacks against the Lucerne international. Its Czechoslovak section had suffered a split in July 1921, as the communists deserted it.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

At the second congress of the Lucerne International, held in Leipzig 1922, the French delegation argued in favour of unification between the two Internationals. This policy was not supported by the congress. The following year, the French affiliate FST decided to shift its membership to [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Ahead of the 1925 Workers Olympiad, the [[Sportintern]] appealed to the Lucerne International that four [[Sportintern]] delegations (France, Soviet Union, Norway, Czechoslovakia) should be allowed to participate. Discussions lingered on within the Lucerne International, but after communist sportsmen had made a public protest at a German Workers Sports Festival in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] in 1924, it was decided that the [[Sportintern]] would be barred from the Workers Olympiad. Likewise SASI barred its affiliates for participating in the 1928 [[Spartakiad]] organised by [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Politically, SASI was supported by the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] and the [[Labour and Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110001136801/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers' Olympiads==
The main activity of SASI was the organizing of the [[International Workers' Olympiads]], portrayed as a socialist alternative to the '[[bourgeois]]' [[Olympics]]. At the Workers Olympiads only the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, rather than national flags.
*The [[1925 Workers' Summer Olympiad|first Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], in 1925. There were around 150,000 spectators. A world record was broken in the 100 meter women's relay race. The summer Workers Olympiad had been preceded by [[1925 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter games]] the same year, in [[Schreiberhau]], in which twelve national delegations had participated.
*The [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad|second Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in 1931. 80,000 athletes took part in the games, which had around 250,000 spectators. The games were larger than the [[1932 Los Angeles Olympics]], both in number of participants and spectators.&lt;ref name="vcn"&gt;http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[1931 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Mürzzuschlag]], [[Austria]], in 1931. Like the summer event, the winter Workers Olympiad was larger (in number of participants and spectators) than the [[1932 Lake Placid Olympics]].
*The [[1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad|third Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] in 1937. For the first time, non-SASI organisations could send delegates. A delegation from the [[Soviet Union]] took part, and won the football final. Around 50,000 people watched the final day of the Workers Olympiad, and 200 000 took part in the closing rally. A [[1937 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter Workers Olympics]] were held in [[Janské Lázně]], [[Czechoslovakia]].
*A [[1943 Workers' Summer Olympiad|fourth Workers' Olympiad]] was planned to be held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1943, but never materialized.&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;Wheeler, Robert F..

The David House Agency was founded in 2011 by [[Eric Volz]] after his own experience of wrongful detainment in Nicaragua. In an article about the agency, ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes it as "a hybrid of international detective work, legal research, political analysis, and diplomatic lobbying."&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"/&gt; The agency works on all aspects of international detainment cases, including case management, hiring and managing of local counsel, fundraising guidance, strategic communications, private diplomacy and lobbying, and aftercare measures.&lt;ref name="Services"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidhouseagency.com/services/|title=David House Agency Services|publisher=The David House Agency|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Profile Cases==
The agency has been at the center of many high-profile cases overseas. Most recently, the David House Agency worked on the wrongful conviction case of [[2013 Huang Case in Qatar|Matthew and Grace Huang]], a Los Angeles couple erroneously accused of starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death in [[Qatar]] in January 2013.&lt;ref name="WallStreetJournal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Felicia|title=Qatar to Allow Americans to Return Home |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-to-allow-americans-to-return-home-1417545931|accessdate=August 2, 2015|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conviction was overturned in December 2014, ending a two-year legal saga and lift of a travel ban—enabling the couple to leave Qatar and reunite with their two sons in the US.

The agency also aided [[Amir Mirzaei Hekmati]], a 28-year-old former U.S. Marine convicted of spying for the CIA in Iran,&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|last=AssociatedPress|title=Former Iran detainees: Publicity helped their case|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/02/20/former-iran-detainees-publicity-helped-their-case/| accessdate=3 August 2015|newspaper=Fox News|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Puracal]], an American who was wrongfully imprisoned in Nicaragua on charges of international drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime,&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Puente |first=David |title=American freed after 2 years in Nicaraguan 'hellhole'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/world/americas/nicaragua-american-released/ |accessdate=August 12, 2015|newspaper=CNN|date=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2009–11 detention of American hikers by Iran|three American hikers]] taken into custody and accused of spying by Iranian border guards while hiking in Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="LABusinessJournal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell |first=Joel |title=Firm Locked In on Freeing U.S. Citizens Overseas|url=http://davidhouseagency.com/la-business-journal-on-david-house-agency/| accessdate=2 August 2015|newspaper=LA Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">'''Thomas Junior Burns''' (April 6, 1923 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1996) was an American accounting scholar and Professor of accounting at [[Ohio State University]], known for his contributions to accounting education.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"&gt;Bailey, A. (1995). "[http://fisher.osu.edu/~young.53/Burns-Bailey.pdf Observations on the academic career of Thomas J. Burns]." ''Perspectives on Academic Careers in Accounting'' D. Jensen (ed.). pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Arena, Wisconsin]], Burns obtained his BA degree from [[University of Wisconsin]], while working at the Gisholt Machine Company. From early 1943 to late 1945 he served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II. Returning to University of Wisconsin, he obtained his BBA in accounting and American history in 1950. Subsequently, he obtained his CPA license for the State of Wisconsin in 1952, his MBA from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1957, and his PhD in accounting from the [[University of Minnesota]] under Carl L. Nelson.&lt;ref name="DD 1996"&gt;Dan Jensen. "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/29520 THOMAS J. BURNS 1923-1996 Professor of Accounting, Emeritus The Ohio State University]," in: ''The Accounting Historians Notebook,'' Spring 1996. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AH0F 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/thomas-junior-burns/ |title=Thomas Junior Burns|publisher=[[The Accounting Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation in 1948, Burns worked at the Wisconsin Department of Taxation briefly, and then became controller for [[Lawrence University]] in Appleton, Wisconsin and later also lecturer. For some time in the late 1950s he also taught accounting at [[Southern Illinois University]]. Eventually in 1963 he moved to [[Ohio State University]], where he became Professor of Accounting in 1967 and chair of the department from 1977 to 1981.&lt;ref name="AH0F 2015"/&gt; One of his first accomplishments was the initiation of a PhD program in modern accounting. Around 1965 he also initiated the Ohio State Accounting Honors Program.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt; Burns was also a Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt;

At the [[American Accounting Association]] (AAA) he served as director of education. He later was awarded the AAA Outstanding Accounting Educator Award, as well as the AICPA Outstanding Accounting Educator Award.&lt;ref name="AB 1995"/&gt; He was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10809">A '''trade association''', also known as an '''industry trade group''', '''business association''', '''sector association''' or '''industry body''', is an organization founded and funded by [[business]]es that operate in a specific [[industry]]. An industry trade association participates in public relations activities such as [[advertising]], [[education]], [[political donations]], [[lobbying]] and [[publishing]], but its focus is collaboration between companies. Associations may offer other services, such as producing conferences, networking or charitable events or offering classes or educational materials. Many associations are [[non-profit organizations]] governed by [[bylaws]] and directed by officers who are also members.

In countries with a [[social market economy]], the role of trade associations is often taken by [[employers' organizations]], which also take a role in [[social dialogue]].

== Political influence ==
{{See also|Advocacy group}}
One of the primary purposes of trade groups, particularly in the United States and to a similar but lesser extent elsewhere, is to attempt to influence [[public policy]] in a direction favorable to the group's members. It can take the form of contributions to the campaigns of political candidates and parties through [[Political Action Committee]]s (PACs); contributions to "issue" campaigns not tied to a candidate or party; and [[lobbying]] [[legislator]]s to support or oppose particular legislation. In addition, trade groups attempt to influence the activities of [[regulatory body|regulatory bodies]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In the United States, direct contributions by PACs to candidates are required to be disclosed to the [[Federal Election Commission]] or state and local election overseers, are considered public information, and have registration requirements for lobbyists. Even so, it can sometimes be difficult to trace the funding for issue and non-electoral campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

== Publishing ==
Almost all trade associations are heavily involved in publishing activities in print and online. The main media published by trade associations are as follows:
* Association website. The association's corporate website typically explains the association's aims and objectives, promotes the association's products and services, explains the benefits of membership to prospective members, and promotes members' businesses (for example, by means of an online listing of members and description of their businesses).
* Members newsletters or magazines. Whether produced in print or online, association newsletters and magazines contain news about the activities of the association, industry news and editorial features on topical issues. Some are exclusively distributed to members, while others are used to lobby lawmakers and regulators, and some are used to promote members' businesses to potential new customers.
* Printed membership directories and yearbooks. Larger trade associations publish membership directories and yearbooks to promote their association to opinion formers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders. Such publications also help to promote members' businesses both to each other and to a wider audience. A typical membership directory contains profiles of each association member, a products and services guide, advertising from members, and editorial articles about the aims, objectives and activities of the association. The emphasis of association yearbooks on the other hand is on editorial features about the association itself and the association's industry.

The opportunity to be promoted in such media (whether by editorial or advertising) is often an important reason why companies join a trade association in the first place.

Examples of larger trade associations that publish a comprehensive range of media include [[European Wind Energy Association]] (EWEA), [[Association of British Travel Agents]] (ABTA) and the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI).

== Generic advertising ==
Industry trade groups sometimes produce advertisements, just as normal corporations do. However, whereas typical advertisements are for a specific corporate product, such as a specific brand of cheese or toilet paper, industry trade groups advertisements generally are targeted to promote the views of an entire industry.

=== Ads to improve industry image ===
These ads mention only the industry's products as a whole, painting them in a positive light in order to have the public form positive associations with that industry and its products. For example, in the USA the advertising campaign "Beef. It's what's for dinner" is used by the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]] to promote a positive image of beef in the public consciousness.

=== Ads to shape opinion on a specific issue ===
These are adverts targeted at specific issues. For example, in the USA in the early 2000s the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) began running advertisements before films that advocate against [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|movie piracy over the Internet]].

== Controversy ==
A common criticism of trade associations is that, while they are not per se "profit-making" organizations that claim to do valuable work which is ultimately for the public benefit, they are in reality fronts for [[price-fixing]] [[cartel]]s and other subtle anti-competitive activities that are not in the public interest.

=== Anti-competitive activity ===
[[Jon Leibowitz]], commissioner at the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in the United States, outlined the potentially anti-competitive nature of some trade association activity in a speech to the [[American Bar Association]] in Washington, D.C. in March 2005 called “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Trade Associations and [[Antitrust]]”. For instance, he said, under the guise of "standard setting" trade associations representing the established players in an industry can set rules that make it harder for new companies to enter a market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/leibowitz/050510goodbadugly.pdf |first=Jon |last=Leibowitz |title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Trade Associations and Antitrust (remarks to American Bar Association Antitrust Spring Meeting, Washington, DC) |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |date=March 30, 2005 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartels ===
In September 2007, the German trade association for [[Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik]] (VBT) and five fastener companies were fined 303 million euros by the [[European Commission]] for operating cartels in the markets for fasteners and attaching machines in Europe and worldwide. In one of the cartels, the [[YKK Group]], [[Coats plc]], the [[Prym]] group, the Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning &amp; Söhne agreed coordinated price increases in annual price rounds with respect to fasteners and their attaching machines, "in the framework of work circles organised by VBT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1362&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=Antitrust: Commission fines members of fasteners cartels over €303 million |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">'''Trade in Services''' refers to the sale and delivery of an [[Intangible asset|intangible product]], called a service, between a producer and consumer.  Trade in services that takes place between a producer and consumer that are, in legal terms, based in different countries is called International Trade in Services.
  
== Methods of Trade ==
International trade in services is defined by the ''Four Modes of Supply'' of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS).

* '''(Mode 1) Cross-Border Trade''' - which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, e.g. remotely providing accounting services in one country for a company based in another country, or an airline flying between two international destinations
* '''(Mode 2) Consumption Abroad''' - this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country, e.g. tourism, telemedicine, or study-abroad
* '''(Mode 3) Commercial Presence''' - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, e.g. a bank opening a physical branch or internet service provider offering internet services in another country
* '''(Mode 4) Presence of Natural Persons''' - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory of any other country, e.g. a business transferring an employee from one country to another for work duties (doctors or architects traveling and working abroad) 

A "[[Natural person]]" is a human being, as distinct from legal persons such as companies or organisations.  Countries can freely decide where to [[economic liberalization|liberalize]] on a sector-by-sector basis, including which specific mode of supply they want to cover for a given sector.

Mode 2 (Consumption Abroad) is by far the most liberalized mode in terms of commitments by WTO members. This is mostly due to governments being less likely to restrict the movements of citizens outside domestic borders (e.g. tourists). Mode 1 (Cross-Border Trade) is not often committed, mostly because it is impossible for many services to be supplied remotely (e.g. construction services), while Mode 3 (Commercial Presence) is more open, reflecting its crucial role in driving the international supply of services, transferring know-how and improving the capacity of economies to participate in global value chains. Mode 4 (Presence of Natural Persons) has the lowest depth of commitments, probably due to a number of sensitivities involved with the movement of foreign workers.&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade In Services|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/20y_e/services_brochure2015_e.pdf|website=World Trade Organization|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value of Trade in Services ==
In 2014, global trade in services totaled some $4.8 trillion, with Mode 3 (commercial presence) accounting for 55% of the total, followed by Mode 1 (cross-border trade) at 30%, then Mode 2 ( consumption abroad) at 10%, and Mode 4 (presence of natural persons) the lowest share, at less than 5%.&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"/&gt;

In wealthy developed economies, services comprise a significant share of GDP and employment. For example, services account for 70% of economic output in the United States and 75% in the European Union.

== Trade Agreements and Law ==
During the Uruguay Round of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the General Agreement on Trade in Services was drafted, and became enshrined as one of the four pillars of the international treaty comprising the [[World Trade Organization]] Agreement in 1995. 

Regional trade in services agreements are also negotiated and signed between regional economic groupings such as [[CARICOM]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and [[ASEAN]].

Beginning in February 2012, 50 countries (28 of which are represented by the European Union) around the world began negotiating the [[Trade in Services Agreement]] (TISA). TISA negotiations primarily comprised high- and upper-middle income countries who were members of the WTO and hoped to further liberalize trade in financial services, healthcare, and transportation between themselves. The agreement has not progressed since early 2016 due to uncertainty surrounding negotiations in the aftermath of many elections that occurred that year.

== Examples ==

Some of the most common examples of trade in service would be:&lt;ref name="wto_services_brochure2015"/&gt;

** Financial &amp; Accountancy services
** Advertising services
** Architectural &amp; Engineering services

Wilhelm Bernardo '''Walter Cramer''' (1 May 1886, [[Leipzig]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]] &amp;ndash; 14 November 1944, [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] businessman from Leipzig and a member of the failed [[20 July Plot]] to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Wolf's Lair]] in [[East Prussia]].

== Life ==
In 1919, Cramer became managing director of the ''Kammgarnspinnerei Gautzsch AG'', a [[worsted]] yarn spinning mill. From 1923, he was on the [[board of directors]] of the ''Leipziger Kammgarnspinnerei Stöhr &amp; Co. AG'', another [[corporation]] in the same industry. In the first half of the 1940s, Cramer took part in civilian resistance against the [[Nazism|Nazi]] régime with Leipzig's former mayor [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] (1884-1945). After the attempt on the [[Führer]]'s life failed on 20 July 1944, Cramer was seized on 22 July, and later found guilty at the ''[[Volksgerichtshof]]'' of [[treason]] and [[high treason]], for which he was sentenced to death. He was [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Plötzensee]] [[Prison]] in Berlin on 14 November 1944.

==Honours==
In 1945, a street in the Gohlis neighbourhood of Leipzig was named ''Walter-Cramer-Straße'' after him. The City of Leipzig also honoured Walter Cramer with a monument in the ''Johannapark'' in 1996.

== Early life ==
Tsui was born in 1914 in Burma (present day [[Myanmar]]).&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; Despite his birth in Burma, Tsui spent the majority of his life either in mainland [[China]] or Hong Kong. Tsui attended school at [[Xiamen University]] in [[Fujian province]].&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

== Career ==
Tsui returned to his birthplace, Burma, in the 1940s and founded the ''[[New Rangoon News]]''.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;  He returned to [[Communist]] China in 1964.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; Tsui finally settled permanently in Hong Kong in 1977.  Once in Hong Kong, Tsui began publishing [[The Mirror (Chinese magazine)|The Mirror]], a pro-Beijing magazine which supported the policies of the mainland.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

Tsui was known for his controversial opinions.  In 1998, he heavily criticized [[RTHK]], a Hong Kong government run [[radio station]], for being too critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese administrations. Tsui urged Hong Kong officials to censor RTHK.&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt;

Tsui served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a Hong Kong committee which advises China's congress.&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt;

Tsui died of organ failure on 9 September 2007 in Hong Kong at the age of 93.&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt; At Tsui's funeral, [[Gao Siren]], Beijing's liaison to Hong Kong praised Tsui for his support of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] and current "[[one country, two systems]]" policy.&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt;  Mourners included high level officials from China and Hong Kong's governments, including the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], [[Donald Tsang]], the director of China's Hong Kong and [[Macau]] affairs office, [[Liao Hui (politician)|Liao Hui]], and former Hong Kong leader, [[Tung Chee-hwa]].&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt; Wreaths and flowers were sent by Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]], Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] and [[Wu Bangguo]], the head of China's congress.&lt;ref name=iht2/&gt;
