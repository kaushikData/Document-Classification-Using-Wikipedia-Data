The '''''Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information''''' ('''ANSSI'''; English: National Cybersecurity Agency of France) is a French service created on 7 July 2009 with responsibility for [[computer security]].&lt;ref name="decret"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PRMD0914748D ''Décret n° 2009-834 du 7 juillet 2009] portant création d'un service à compétence nationale dénommé « Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information »'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANSSI reports to the [[Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security (France)|Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security]] (SGDSN) to assist the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] in exercising his responsibilities for defence and national security.

ANSSI replaced the {{illm|Central Directorate of Computer Security|WD=Q3029451}}, which on July 31, 2001 replaced the [[Service central de la sécurité des systèmes d'informations|SCSSI]].

Guillaume Poupard, Chief Engineer of Armaments, was appointed Director General of ANSSI on 27 March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.01net.com/editorial/616970/guillaume-poupard-prend-la-tete-de-l-anssi/ |title=''Guillaume Poupard prend la tête de l’Anssi'' | author = |dead-url=no | access-date=28 March 2014 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PRMX1407391D Décret du 27 mars 2014] portant nomination du directeur général de l'Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information - M. POUPARD (Guillaume)'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding {{illm|Patrick Pailloux|WD=Q16669187}}. 

ANSSI has a budget of €80 million (2014) and a workforce of 500 in 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q14/14-29424QE.htm ''Question no 29424 de M. Julien Aubert sur les moyens publics alloués à la cyberdéfense''], [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], Réponse publiée le : 24/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and with a target of 567 by the end of 2017.

==Background and context==
ANSSI is heir to a long line of bodies responsible for ensuring the security of sensitive information belonging to the French State:&lt;ref name="historique"&gt;[http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/anssi/presentation/l-historique-de-l-anssi.html ''Historique de l'ANSSI''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030170607/http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/anssi/presentation/l-historique-de-l-anssi.html |date=October 30, 2014 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1943: Computing Technical Directorate (created in [[Algiers]]);
* 1951: Computing Technical Service Centre (in Paris);
* 1977: the Central Communications Security Establishment;
* 1986: the [[Service central de la sécurité des systèmes d'informations|Central Service for Computer Security]];
* 2001: {{illm|Central Directorate of Computer Security|WD=Q3029451}}.

These organizations initially created in a military security perspective confidential information and data protection have gradually evolved. In 1986, the Central Communications Security Establishment has been replaced by the Central Service for Computer Security. Today ANSSI retains a mission of the defence of state information systems, but is also charged with a mission to provide advice and support to government and operators of critical national infrastructure.

==Missions==
ANSSI has the following mission:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The agency ensures the mission of national authority security of information systems. As such it is responsible for proposing rules for the protection of state information systems and verify the implementation of measures adopted.

In the field of cyber defence, it provides a monitor, detect, alert and reaction to computer attacks, especially on the networks of the State."&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation des missions sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/fr/anssi/missions/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization==

===Management===
[[Image:Patrick Pailloux.jpg|thumb|Patrick Pailloux with ANSSI during dating ''Journées Réseaux'' 2013 in [[Montpellier]].]]
ANSSI is headed by a Director General (currently Guillaume Poupard), appointed by the Prime Minister. He is assisted by a Deputy Director and a Chief of Staff.

ANSSI has five sub-directorates:

* the [[:fr:Centre opérationnel de la sécurité des systèmes d'information|Centre for the Operational Security of Information Systems]]  {{fr icon}} (COSSI) that ensures the implementation of the defense authority-based information systems devoted to ANSSI.
* Sub-Directorate Expertise (SDE)&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation de la sous-direction SDE sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/organisation/les-sous-directions/la-sous-direction-expertise/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carries the overall mission of expertise and technical assistance of the agency. It supports all the other sub-directorates ANSSI, ministries, industry and providers of security and vital operators.
* Sub-Directorate Secure Information Systems (SIS)&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation de la sous-direction SIS sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/organisation/les-sous-directions/la-sous-direction-systemes-dinformation-securises/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carries the mission to propose, design and implement products and secure information systems for the benefit of ministries, operators and vital importance ANSSI .
* Sub-Directorate External Relations and Coordination (RELEC)&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation de la sous-direction RELEC sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/organisation/les-sous-directions/la-sous-direction-relations-exterieures-et-coordination/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that animates, transverse manner, the external relations of the agency, coordination of interventions and the development of regulations.
* Sub-Directorate General Affairs (SDAG)&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation de la sous-direction SDAG sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/organisation/les-sous-directions/la-sous-direction-affaires-generales-sdag/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in charge of preparing and managing support of administrative activities at ANSSI.

ANSSI also has its own training centre, the Safety Training Centre for Information Systems (CFSSI),&lt;ref&gt;''Présentation du CFSSI sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/formations/presentation/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718164637/http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/formations/presentation/ |date=July 18, 2015 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; including delivering degrees in computer security (ESSI), registered in the [[Commission Nationale de la Certification Professionnelle|National Directory of Professional Certifications]].

===Governance===
ANSSI governance is ensured by a Strategic Committee&lt;ref&gt;''Comité stratégique de la SSI sur le site de l'ANSSI'' [http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/comite-strategique/ ssi.gouv.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001062949/http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/comite-strategique/ |date=October 1, 2015 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* the [[Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security (France)|General Secretary of Defence and National Security]] (chairman),
* the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]];
* the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, Overseas France and Territorial Communities]];
* the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Secretary General of Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs]];
* the [[Direction générale de l'armement|Delegate General for Armaments]];
* the [[Directorate-General for External Security|Director General of External Security]];
* the Director General of Information and Communication Systems;
* the General Manager of the Modernization of the State;
* the [[Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure|Director General of Internal Security]];
* Vice President of the General Council of Industry, Energy and Technology;
* Director General of the National Agency for Computer Security.

==Means==
According to a [[Senate (France)|Senate]] report, although significant efforts have been put in place in recent years, the situation in France with regard to the threat from cyber attacks is still unsatisfactory. Indeed, ANSSI lacks financial and human resources comparable to its American, British and German counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/rap/r11-681/r11-68123.html ''La cyberdéfense : un enjeu mondial, une priorité nationale''] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The grave of Alexander Taylor Innes, Dean Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of Alexander Taylor Innes, Dean Cemetery]]
'''Alexander Taylor Innes''' [[FRSE]] LLD (1833–1912), was a lawyer, writer, biographer and [[church historian]]. In authorship he is usually abbreviated as '''A.T.I.'''

==Life==
He was born on 18 December 1833 at [[Tain]], Ross and Cromarty. His father was Alexander Innes, an accountant and bank agent, and his mother, Martha Taylor. He was educated at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101129175605/http://www.tainroyalacademy.org.uk/ Royal Academy] in [[Tain]] and from 1848 to 1852 at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]]. Taylor Innes entered the legal profession although he originally intended to study theology and become a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. His scruples about accepting the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] prevented him from doing so although he remained within the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] communion. He contributed to articles on a religious theme to various journals, and his interest in the legal aspects of church [[creed]]s and traditions led to the publication of his pioneering work, ''The Law of Creeds in Scotland'', in 1867. He corresponded with [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]] on the subject of the [[disestablishment]] of the Scottish Church and visited him in May 1868. He also wrote a scholarly paper called "[[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] in Transition"&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] in Transition." ''[[Contemporary Review]]'' 15 (1870): 630–647&lt;/ref&gt; in which he defended Gladstone's views, and for which he received the latter's appreciation. In 1881, Taylor Innes was appointed [[Advocate Depute]] under Gladstone's second government (1880–1885) and was reappointed under the subsequent Gladstone (1892–94) and [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Rosebery]] (1894–95) governments. In later life he withdrew from active legal practice to concentrate on ecclesiastical issues, where perhaps his historical significance lies.

In 1880, he married Sophia Dingwall Fordyce, daughter of Alexander D. Fordyce, a landowner and Liberal MP. She died less than a year later.

In 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[John McLaren, Lord McLaren]], [[John Horne]], [[John Rankine]] and [[John Sutherland Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life he lived at 48 Morningside Park in south-west Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1912–13&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Edinburgh on 27 January 1912&lt;ref name=probate&gt;{{cite book|title=Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England|year=1912|publisher=Principal Probate Registry|page=221|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Innes's biography in the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The tall pink granite obelisk marking his grave lies at the west end of the main east-west path under the trees opposite the pyramid to Rutherfurd.

* 1854–1857 – Completed his law apprenticeship in [[Edinburgh]].
* 1857–1869 – Legal practice in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]].

The Centres were established on the authority of [[Charles Tegart|Sir Charles Tegart]], a senior [[police officer]] ‘headhunted’ from [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]].&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Victims were [[Waterboarding|waterboarded]] and generally given the [[Third degree (interrogation)|‘third degree’]] until they ‘spilled the beans’.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; One such centre in a Jewish quarter of West [[Jerusalem]] was closed only after colonial official [[Edward Keith-Roach]], the governor of Jerusalem, complained to the [[High Commissioners of Palestine|High Commissioner]].&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Keith-Roach argued that ‘questionable practises {{sic}}’ were counter-productive both in terms of the information gathered and the effect on local people's confidence in the [[Palestine Police Force|police]].&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;
The [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Archdeacon]] in Palestine believed police abuses were the cause of the violence rather than a response to it. He detailed the daily complaints from Arabs of beatings at the hands of rampaging police officers in a letter to the Mandate Chief Secretary in 1936.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; An Anglican chaplain in [[Haifa]] also wrote to the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem|Lord Bishop in Jerusalem]], [[George Francis Graham Brown|Graham Brown]], in December 1937 about an incident he witnessed in which a suspect whose teeth were already knocked out before he was brought into the station was given another brutal beating:&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A second man came in who was in plain clothes, but whom I took to be one of the British Police, and I saw him put a severe double arm lock on the man from behind, and then beat him about the head and body in what I can only describe as a brutal and callous way. Once or twice he stopped and turned to the other people in the station, and in an irresponsible and gloating manner said "I'm so sorry"—"I'm awfully sorry." And then proceeded to punch the prisoner round the station again. A third man came in. He was in plain clothes, and was wearing a soft felt hat. He was, I think, British, and may have been a member of the Police Force, but I thought at the time that he was a soldier in civilian clothes .... But this man also made a vicious and violent attack on the prisoner, and punched him about the head and body .... I am gravely disturbed at the possibility that one of the men who was in the station, and who beat up the first person who was brought in was not a member of the police force, but a soldier—this was the man who was wearing a soft felt [[trilby hat]] .... I was for two years Chaplain to a prison in [[England]], and in the course of my duties not infrequently witnessed the methods which police and prison warders were compelled to use with men detained or serving long terms of imprisonment, and can only say what I saw on this occasion sickened me and filled me with the gravest misgivings.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Palestinians themselves also made complaints to the authorities.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; There are accounts in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of suspects being tortured, being beaten until they were unable to walk, being blown to bits, being left in open cages in the sun without sustenance, being beaten with wet ropes, ‘boxed’ and having their teeth smashed, of having their feet burnt with oil and of ‘needles’ being used on suspects and of dogs being set upon Arab detainees.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; British and [[Jewish Supernumerary Police|Jewish auxiliary forces]] maltreated Arabs by having them hold heavy stones and then beating them when they dropped them.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; Guards also used [[bayonet]]s on sleep-deprived men and made them wear bells around their necks and then dance.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

Arab prisoners jumped to their deaths from high windows to escape their captors, had their testicles tied with cord, were tortured with strips of wood with nails in, had wire tightened around their big toes, hair was torn from their faces and heads, special instruments were used to extract fingernails, red hot [[skewer]]s were used on detainees, prisoners were sodomised, boiling oil and intoxicants were used on prisoners, as were electric shocks, and water was funnelled into suspects’ stomachs. There were also [[mock execution]]s.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

Despite protests and revulsion expressed even by British officials and Anglican clergy [[Extrajudicial killing|extrajudicial executions]], torture, beatings and general violence remained commonplace responses by the police during the Arab revolt.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

The issue of why [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] was not bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]] continues to be explored by historians.

In 1942, Lieutenant [[Jan Karski]] reported to the Polish, British and U.S. governments on the situation in [[occupied Poland]], especially the [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto]] and the general systematic extermination of the Poles and Jews nationally.

He also spoke to [[Anthony Eden]], the British Foreign Secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and in [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]]. In 1943 in London he met the author and journalist [[Arthur Koestler]]. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Karski met also with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Cordell Hull]], [[William Joseph Donovan]], and [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen Wise]]. Karski presented his report to media, to bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal [[Samuel Stritch]]), to members of the [[Hollywood]] film industry and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him, or judged his testimony much exaggerated or saw it as propaganda from the [[Polish government in exile]].&lt;ref name="Stanislaw M.

In 1942 members of Polish government in exile published an official Polish protest against systematic murders of Polish and Jewish population in occupied Poland, based on the ''Jan Karski report'' and titled "[[The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland]]". The Poles addressed their protest to the 26 Allies who had signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] on 1 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Republic of Poland|first= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |authorlink= Polish government-in-exile|title= The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland |url= http://bolekchrobry.tripod.com/polishinformationcenter19391945/id22.html |accessdate= 4 January 2013|year= 1942 |publisher= [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson and Company]] |location= London |oclc= 23800633 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] issued on December 17, 1942 an official statement titled [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations|Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations Against Extermination of the Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was read to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] in a floor speech by Foreign secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and published on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1FFC3B5D167B93CAA81789D95F468485F9| title = 11 ALLIES CONDEMN NAZI WAR ON JEWS; | date = December 18, 1942| accessdate = February 3, 2012| publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by many other newspapers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1942 [[Szmul Zygielbojm]], a Jewish-Polish [[socialism|socialist]] politician, leader of the [[General Jewish Labor Bund in Poland]], and member of the National Council of the [[Polish government in exile]], wrote in English a booklet titled ''Stop Them Now. German Mass Murder of Jews in Poland'', with a foreword by [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Lord Wedgwood]].&lt;ref&gt;Szmul Zygielbojm, "Stop Them Now.

{{Main|Bermuda Conference}}

From April 19, 1943, through April 30, 1943, during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 19 April to 16 May, representatives of the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] held an international conference at [[Hamilton, Bermuda]]. They discussed the question of [[Jew]]ish [[refugee]]s who had been liberated by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and of those who still remained in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe. The only agreement made was that the war against the Nazis must be won. The US did not raise its immigration quotas and the British prohibition on Jewish refugees seeking refuge in the British Mandate of Palestine remained in place. A week later, the American [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Committee for a Jewish Army]] ran an advertisement in ''The New York Times'' condemning the United States efforts at Bermuda as a mockery of past promises to the Jewish people and of Jewish suffering under German Nazi occupation.&lt;ref&gt;"To 5,000,000 Jews in the Nazi Death-Trap Bermuda was a Cruel Mockery", ''The New York Times'', 04 May 1943, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szmul Zygielbojm]], a member of the Jewish advisory body to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], committed suicide in protest.&lt;ref name="Stanislaw M.

===Auschwitz prisoners reports===

====The Polish underground reports====
At the beginning of [[Operation Reinhard]], the principal source of intelligence for the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] about the existence of Auschwitz was the [[Witold's Report]], forwarded via the Polish resistance to the [[British government]] in [[London]]. It was written by the Polish Army Captain [[Witold Pilecki]] who spent a total of 945 days at the camp&amp;nbsp;– the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. He forwarded his report about the camp to [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] headquarters in [[Warsaw]] through the underground network known as [[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]] which he organized inside Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="Garlinski"&gt;[[Jozef Garlinski]], ''Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp'', [[Fawcett Publications|Fawcett]], 1975, {{ISBN|0-449-22599-2}}, reprinted by [[Time Life]] Education, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8094-8925-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witold Pilecki|Pilecki]] hoped that either the Allies would drop weapons for the [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK) to organize an assault on the camp from the outside, or bring in the [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]] troops to liberate it. A spectacular escape took place on 20 June 1942, when [[Kazimierz Piechowski]] (prisoner no. 918) organized a daring passing through the camp's gate along with three friends and co-conspirators, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, Józef Lempart and Eugeniusz Bendera.&lt;ref name="Piechowski"&gt;Kazimierz Piechowski, Eugenia Bozena Kodecka-Kaczynska, Michal Ziokowski, ''Byłem Numerem: swiadectwa Z Auschwitz''  Wydawn. Siostr Loretanek, hardcover, {{ISBN|83-7257-122-8}}.&amp;nbsp;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escapees were dressed in stolen uniforms as members of the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|SS-Totenkopfverbände]], fully armed and in an SS staff car. They drove out the main gate in a stolen [[Steyr automobile|Steyr]] [[Steyr 120|220]] with a smuggled first report from [[Witold Pilecki]] to [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]]. The Germans never recaptured any of them.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=578&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Auschwitz-Birkenau – The Film about the Amazing Escape from Auschwitz – Now Available on DVD |author=Gabriela Nikliborc |publisher=En.auschwitz.org.pl |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |quote=''Uciekinier'' [The Escapee] directed and written by Marek Tomasz Pawłowski for [[Telewizja Polska]]; 56 minutes.

He escaped from the camp on the night of April 26–27, 1943.&lt;ref name="Pilecki1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Adam Cyra]] |author2=Witold Pilecki|title=Ochotnik do Auschwitz; Witold Pilecki (1901–1948)|year=2000 |page= |chapter=II |publisher=Chrześcijańskie Stowarzyszenie Rodzin Oświęcimskich |location=Oświęcim |isbn=83-912000-3-5 |url=http://www.powstanie-warszawskie-1944.ac.pl/raport_witolda.htm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written accounts of Auschwitz concentration camp were published in 1940/41 in the Polish underground newspapers ''"[[Polska żyje]]"'' ("Poland lives") and ''"[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]"''&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Bartoszewski]], "Warszawski pierścień śmierci 1939–1944", Zachodnia Agencja Prasowa, Warszawa 1967, Interpress, Warszawa 1970, Świat Książki, Warszawa 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-247-1242-7}}. Published also in english in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942 members of the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of the Warsaw Area [[Home Army]] also began to publish short booklets based on the experiences of escapees. The first was the fictional "Auschwitz. Memories of a prisoner" written by [[Halina Krahelska]] and published in April 1942 in [[Warsaw]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Halina Krahelska]], "Oświęcim. Pamiętnik więźnia", BIP Okręgu Warszawskiego AK (eng. [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of Warsaw Area [[Home Army]]), Warszawa 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; The second publication was also produced in 1942 in the [[Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence|PPS WRN]] book "Obóz śmierci" ("Camp of death") written by [[Natalia Zarembina]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalia Zarembina]], "Obóz śmierci", Wydawnictwo WRN, Warsaw 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1942 a book about Auschwitz titled "W piekle" ("In Hell") was written by the Polish writer, social activist and founder of [[Żegota]], [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], "W piekle", Front Odrodzenia Polski, Warszawa 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish reports about Auschwitz were also published in English versions. A booklet titled Zarembina was translated into English and published by the Polish Labor Group in New York in March 1944 with the title "Oswiecim, Camp of Death (Underground Report)" with a foreword by [[Florence Jaffray Harriman]]. In this report from 1942, the gassing of prisoners was described.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp42317 "Oswiecim, Camp of Death (Underground Report)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Auschwitz site plans, originating from the Polish government, were passed on to the British Foreign Office on 18 August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A letter to the U.K foreign office, with plans of Auschwitz|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/eastern-europe/investigation/camps/sources/docs/7/|date=18 August 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Władysław Bartoszewski]], himself a former Auschwitz inmate (camp number 4427), said in a speech: ''"The Polish resistance movement kept informing and alerting the free world to the situation. In the last quarter of 1942, thanks to the Polish emissary Jan Karski and his mission, and also by other means, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States were well informed about what was going on in Auschwitz-Birkenau."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalepolitik.de/archiv/jahrgang2005/februar2006/download/210a25b641ad11dbaf97c1fbeff912521252/original_IP_02-05_Dok-Web.pdf Address by the former Foreign Minister of Poland Wladysław Bartoszewski at the ceremony of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 27 January 2005] see pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Jewish escapees reports====
On April 7, 1944, two young Jewish inmates, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], had escaped from the [[Auschwitz]] camp with detailed information about the camp's geography, the gas chambers, and the numbers being killed. The information, later called the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]], is believed to have reached the Jewish community in [[Budapest]] by April 27. Roswell McClelland, the U.S. [[War Refugee Board]] representative in [[Switzerland]], is known to have received a copy by mid-June, and sent it to the board's executive director on June 16, according to [[Raul Hilberg]].&lt;ref name="Hilberg1215"&gt;[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]]. ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', [[Yale University Press]], 2003, p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt; Information based on the report was broadcast on June 15 by the [[BBC]] and on June 20 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. The full report was first published on November 25, 1944, by the U.S. [[War Refugee Board]], the same day that the last 13 prisoners, all women, were killed in Auschwitz (the women were "unmittelbar getötet"—killed immediately—leaving open whether they were gassed or otherwise killed).&lt;ref&gt;Czech, Danuta (ed) ''Kalendarium der Ereignisse im Konzentrationslager Auschwitz-Birkenau 1939–1945'', Reinbek bei Hamburg, 1989, pp.920 and 933, using information from a series called ''Hefte von Auschwitz'', and cited in [[Karny, Miroslav]].

Auschwitz was first overflown by an Allied reconnaissance aircraft on April 4, 1944, in a mission to photograph the synthetic oil plant at [[Monowitz]] [[forced labor]] camp (Auschwitz III).&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article507013.ece Could Britain have done more to stop the horrors of Auschwitz?]; January 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June, 71 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] heavy bombers on another bombing run had flown above or close to three railway lines to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="Saur1989p319"/&gt;

On July 7, shortly after the U.S. War Department refused requests from Jewish leaders to bomb the railway lines leading to the camps, a force of 452 [[Fifteenth Air Force]] bombers flew along and across the five deportation railway lines on their way to bomb [[Blechhammer]] oil refineries nearby.&lt;ref name="Gutman1998p577"/&gt;

Farben industrial complex located adjacent to the Monowitz forced labor camp (Auschwitz III) located {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the Auschwitz I camp was bombed four times, starting at 20 August 1944 until 26 December 1944.&lt;ref name="Gutman1998p578"/&gt; On December 26, 1944, the U.S. 455th Bomb Group bombed Monowitz and targets near [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] (Auschwitz II); an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[military hospital]] was hit and five SS personnel were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/highlights/auschwitz/?content=2 Auschwitz through the lens of the SS: Photos of Nazi leadership at the camp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011192402/http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/highlights/auschwitz/?content=2 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auschwitz complex was photographed accidentally several times during missions aimed at nearby military targets.&lt;ref name="brugioni1"&gt;Dino Brugioni and Robert Poirier, ''The Holocaust revisited: A retrospective analysis of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination complex''; [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v44i4a06p_0001.htm CIA report 1978] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506085022/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v44i4a06p_0001.htm |date=May 6, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the photo-analysts knew nothing of Auschwitz, and the political and military hierarchy didn't know that photos of Auschwitz existed.&lt;ref name="brugioni2"&gt;Dino Brugioni, Auschwitz and Birkenau: Why the World War II photo interpreters failed to Identify the extermination complex, ''Military Intelligence'', vol. 9, no. 1 (Jan.-Mar. 1983): pages 50–55. Republished [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/imint/holocaust2.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the photos played no part in the decision whether or not to bomb Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="brugioni2"/&gt; Photo-interpretation expert Dino Brugioni believes that analysts could have easily identified the important buildings in the complex if they had been asked to look.&lt;ref name="brugioni2"/&gt;

==Bombing Auschwitz: Technical considerations==
Since the controversy began in the 1970s, a number of military experts have looked at the problems involved in bombing Auschwitz and the rail lines and have concluded that it would have been extremely difficult and risky and that the chances of achieving significant results would have been small.&lt;ref name="myth"&gt;William D. Rubinstein, The Myth of Rescue, London, Routledge 1997, especially Chapter 4, "The Myth of Bombing Auschwitz".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, Auschwitz and the Allies, New York, Holt, Rinehart, 1981, especially Part Three, "Auschwitz Revealed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Kitchens, "The Bombing of Auschwitz Re-examined", in The Journal of Military History, LVIII, April 1994, pp.233–266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Levy, "The Bombing of Auschwitz Revisited: A Critical Analysis", in The Bombing of Auschwitz, St. Martins Press, 2000, p. 101, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 documentary, ''Auschwitz; the forgotten evidence'' included interviews with historians [[William Rubinstein]] and [[Richard Overy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815441/|title=Auschwitz: The Forgotten Evidence (TV Movie 2004)|date=14 July 2015|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mentioned the [[Jewish Agency]]'s request to the Allies on 6 July to bomb Auschwitz and showed the aerial reconnaissance photographs. It then examined the operational and technical feasibility aspects, in two categories: [[precision bombing]] by [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]-type aircraft, and [[area bombing]] by larger aircraft. It considered that precision bombing of railway lines was so common by 1944 that the Germans had specialist teams that could repair damage within hours or days. The inmates' food supplies were assumed to come by rail, and so an unrepaired railway would cause them hardship. Area bombing risked killing too many prisoners.

From March 1944 onwards, the Allies were in control of the skies over [[Europe]].  According to historian David Wyman the 15th [[U.S. Army Air Force]], which was based in [[Italy]], had the range and capability to strike Auschwitz from early May 1944.&lt;ref name="Gutman1998p577"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bombing_survey"/&gt;  General [[Ira C. Eaker]], the American [[Mediterranean Allied Air Forces]] Commander, whose airplanes were already bombing nearby [[Auschwitz]],&lt;ref name="Gutman1998p577"/&gt; in July 1944 visited the Air Ministry in London.  When the request to bomb [[Auschwitz]] was put to Churchill, he gave it his full support.  He regarded it as something that the American daylight bombers could and should do.&lt;ref name="Gilbert_Churchill_Holocaust"/&gt;

On August 24, 1944, the U.S. Army Air Forces carried out a bombing operation against a factory adjacent to the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. Despite perfect weather conditions, 315 prisoners were killed, 525 seriously harmed, and 900 lightly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens III, James H.  "The Bombing of Auschwitz Reexamined," Newton. FDR and the Holocaust. St. Martin's Press, 1996, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submitted proposals to bomb Auschwitz and reactions==
The first proposal to bomb Auschwitz was made on 16 May 1944 by a Slovak rabbi, [[Michael Dov Weissmandl]], a leader in an underground Slovak organization known as the [[Bratislava Working Group|Working Group]] to the Jewish Agency. According to Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]], Weissmandl's proposal is the basis of subsequent proposals.{{sfn|Bauer|2001|p=234}} At about the same time, two officials of the Jewish Agency in Palestine separately made similar suggestions. Yitzhak Gruenbaum made his to the U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Lowell C. Pinkerton, and Moshe Shertok made his to George Hall, the British under secretary of state for foreign affairs. However, the idea was promptly squashed by the Executive Board of the Jewish Agency. On 11 June 1944, the Executive of the Jewish Agency considered the proposal, with [[David Ben Gurion]] in the chair, and it specifically opposed the bombing of Auschwitz. Ben Gurion summed up the results of the discussion: "The view of the board is that we should not ask the Allies to bomb places where there are Jews."&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; 

In the meantime, [[George Mantello]] distributed the [[Auschwitz Protocols]] (including the [[Vrba–Wetzler report]]) and [[Vrba–Wetzler report#Report's arrival in Switzerland, press coverage|triggered a significant grass roots protest in Switzerland]], including Sunday masses, street protests and the Swiss Press Campaign. On 19 June 1944 [[Jewish Agency for Israel|the Jewish Agency]] in Jerusalem received the reports summary.  David Ben Gurion and the Jewish Agency had reversed its opposition immediately upon learning that Auschwitz was indeed a death camp, and urged U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to bomb the camp and the train tracks leading to the camp.&lt;ref name=haaretz_auschwitz_bombing/&gt;

Shortly thereafter, [[Benjamin Akzin]], a junior official on the War Refugee Board staff made a similar recommendation. It was put in writing in an inter-office memorandum dated June 29 to his superior, a senior staff member, Lawrence S. Lesser. These recommendations were totally rejected by leading Jewish organizations. On June 28, Lesser met with A. Leon Kubowitzki, the head of the Rescue Department of the World Jewish Congress, who flatly opposed the idea. On July 1, Kubowitzki followed up with a letter to War Refugee Board Director [[War Refugee Board#Composition|John W. Pehle]], recalling his conversation with Lesser and stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The destruction of the death installations can not be done by bombing from the air, as the first victims would be the Jews who are gathered in these camps, and such a bombing would be a welcome pretext for the Germans to assert that their Jewish victims have been massacred not by their killers, but by the Allied bombers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The American reactions===
In June 1944, [[War Refugee Board#Composition|John Pehle]] of the [[War Refugee Board]] and [[Benjamin Akzin]], a [[Zionist]] activist in America, urged the [[United States Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] to bomb the camps. McCloy told his assistant to "kill" the request,&lt;ref name="Gilbert_Churchill_Holocaust"/&gt; as the [[United States Army Air Forces]] had decided in February 1944 not to bomb anything "for the purposes of rescuing victims of enemy oppression", but to concentrate on military targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/press/man-wanted-bomb-auschwitz.1510.htm|title=The man who wanted to bomb Auschwitz|work=The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rubinstein says that Akzin was not involved in discussions between Pehle and McCloy, and that Pehle specifically told McCloy that he was transmitting an idea proposed by others, that he had "several doubts about the matter," and that he was not "at this point at least, requesting the [[US War Department|War Department]] to take any action on this proposal other than to appropriately explore it."&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;

On August 2, General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz]], commander of the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe]], expressed sympathy for the idea of bombing Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="Breitman2013p284"/&gt; Several times thereafter, in the summer and early autumn of 1944, the War Refugee Board relayed to the War Department suggestions by others that Auschwitz and/or the rail lines could be bombed. It repeatedly noted that it was not endorsing anything.  On October 4, 1944, the War Department sent (and only this time) a rescue-oriented bombing proposal to General Spaatz in England for consideration. Although Spaatz's officers had read Mann's message reporting acceleration of extermination activities in the camps in Poland, they could perceive no advantage to the victims in smashing the killing machinery, and decided not to bomb [[Auschwitz]].  Nor did they seem to understand, despite Mann's statement that "the Germans are increasing their extermination activities," that wholesale massacres had already been perpetrated.&lt;ref name="Saur1989p316"/&gt;

Finally, on November 8, 1944, having half-heartedly changed sides, Pehle ordered McCloy to bomb the camp.  He said it could help some of the inmates to escape and would be good for the "morale of underground groups."  According to [[Kai Bird]], [[Nahum Goldmann]] apparently also changed his mind.  Sometime in the autumn of 1944, Goldmann went to see McCloy in his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] office and personally raised the bombing issue with him. However, by November 1944, Auschwitz was more or less completely shut down.

===The British reactions===
The British Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], did not see bombing as a solution, given that bombers were inaccurate and would also kill prisoners on the ground. The land war would have to be won first. Bombers were used against German cities and to carpet-bomb the front lines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} According to [[Martin Gilbert]],&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt; Churchill pushed for bombing. Concerning the concentration camps, he wrote to his Foreign Secretary on July 11, 1944: "...all concerned in this crime who may fall into our hands, including the people who only obeyed orders by carrying out these butcheries, should be put to death..."&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston. ''Triumph and Tragedy''. Penguin 2005, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Air Ministry]] was asked to examine the feasibility of bombing the camps and decided not to for "operational reasons," which were not specified in wartime. In August 1944, 60 tons of supplies were flown to assist the [[Warsaw Uprising|uprising in Warsaw]] and, considering the dropping accuracy at that time, were to be dropped "into the south-west quarter of Warsaw." For various reasons, only seven aircraft reached the city.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, 2005. pp. 115–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war analysis==
[[Michael Berenbaum]] has argued that it is not only a historical question, but "a moral question emblematic of the Allied response to the plight of the [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref name="BerenbaumEB"&gt;Berenbaum, Michael. "Why wasn't Auschwitz bombed?" ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wyman]] has asked: "How could it be that the governments of the two great Western democracies knew that a place existed where 2,000 helpless human beings could be killed every 30 minutes, knew that such killings actually did occur over and over again, and yet did not feel driven to search for some way to wipe such a [[scourge#Metaphoric use|scourge]] from the earth?"&lt;ref name="Wyman583"&gt;Wyman, David S. "Why Auschwitz wasn't bombed," in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp''. Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin A. Mahoney|Kevin Mahoney]], in an analysis of three requests submitted to the allies to bombard railway lines leading to Auschwitz, concludes that: 

{{quote|The fate of the three requests to the MAAF in late August and early September 1944 dramatically illustrates why all proposals to bomb the rail facilities used to deport the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz during 1944, as well as to bomb the camp itself, failed. None was able to outweigh overriding military aims in pursuit of final victory over the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mahoney |first=K. A. |date=2011-12-01 |title=An American Operational Response to a Request to Bomb Rail Lines to Auschwitz |url=https://academic.oup.com/hgs/article/25/3/438/624228 |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |language=en |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=438–446 |doi=10.1093/hgs/dcr049 |issn=8756-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

William Rubenstein, in ''The Myth of Rescue'', mentions that the debate did not start until 1967: "For the first twenty years or so after the end of the Second World War, probably no historical work on the Holocaust criticized the actions of the Allies or suggested that much more could have been done which was not done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4783">'''Avner Offer''' (born 1944) is an economic historian who held the [[Chichele Professorship]] in [[Economic history]] at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. He is an Emeritus Fellow of [[All Souls College]], Oxford, and a fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He has published on [[international political economy]], law, the [[First World War]] and [[land tenure]]. During the 1990s and 2000s, Offer's main interest was in post-war economic growth, particularly in developed societies, and the challenges that affluence presents to well being. His most recent work is on the strife between neoclassical economics and social democracy, each of them vying to shape the post-war decades. Apart from his academic work, he has published a memoir of the Six Day War in Israel.

==Biography==
Avner Offer was born and raised in [[Israel]]. He was educated at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (B.A. 1973) and [[Oxford University]] (D.Phil. 1979).&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/avoffer/avneroffer]&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked at the [[University of York]], the [[Australian National University]], and the University of Oxford, with research fellowships at the [[University of Southampton]], the [[University of Cambridge]], [[Rutgers University]] and [[New York University]]. He was a Professorial Fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], between 1992 and 2000. He is married with two children.

Offer's book of 2006, ''The Challenge of Affluence: Self-Control and Well-Being in the United States and Britain since 1950'', represents to some extent a challenge to [[Neoclassical economics]]. Through it he argues that "well-being" has in fact lagged behind the increasing affluence of western societies: that "affluence breeds impatience, and impatience undermines well-being...the paradox of affluence and its challenge is that the flow of new rewards can undermine the capacity to enjoy them."&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Affluence: Self-control and Well-being in the USA and Britain since 1950. (Oxford, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The central concepts are therefore future discount, [[bounded rationality]], and [[myopia]].

In the 2016 ''The Nobel Factor: The Prize in Economics, Social Democracy, and the Market Turn'', he argues the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] has disproportionately been awarded to proponents of the neoclassical school. According to the book's thesis, the Nobel Prize provides a halo of scientific authority but its committee has underrepresented social democracy as a school of economical thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2097">'''Bartolomeo Facio''' (c. before 1410 &amp;ndash; 1457), [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as '''Bartholomaus Facius''', was an Italian historian, writer and [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/faciob.htm ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Facio, Bartolomeo [sometimes "Fazio'], latinized as, Facius, Bartholomaus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facio was born into a wealthy family of [[La Spezia]], [[Liguria]]. He studied in [[Verona]], where he studied with [[Guarino Guarini]], [[Florence]], where he added Greek to his Latin, and [[Genoa]] and was a notary in [[Lucca]] and Genoa. In 1443 he moved to [[Naples]] at first as the Genoese envoy, then by 1445 at the service of King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] as secretary and official historian. Facius served as tutor to Prince Ferrante, who became [[Ferdinand I of Naples]].

In addition to translations, his works include ''De viris illustribus'' (1456), which comprises over ninety brief lives, organized by professions; his introduction to the section of painters ranks him among [[art historian]]s. He also wrote the court history ''De rebus gestis ab Alphonso I Neapolitanorum rege libri X'' (1448-1445), and the moral treatises ''De humanae vitae felicitate'' ("Of the felicities of human lives") and ''De excellentia ac praestantia hominis'' ("Of the excellences and outstanding character of Man"). His  ''De bello veneto clodiano'' remained in manuscript until it was published in 1568.

Like many humanists of his era, Facio engaged in skirmishes with his peers, such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] whose ''Antidotum in Facium'' is an invective against Bartolomeo.

He died at Naples in 1457.

'''Charles Joseph Singer''' (2 November 1876 – 10 June 1960) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[History of science|historian of science, technology, and medicine]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Singer was born in [[Camberwell]] in [[London]], where his father [[Simeon Singer]] was a [[rabbi]] and [[Hebrew|Hebraist]]. He was educated at [[City of London School]], [[University College London]], and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] ([[Zoology]] 1896-99, Honorary Fellow 1953). Trained in zoology and medicine, he qualified for medical practice in 1903.  He was appointed medical officer on an expedition led by [[Sir John Harrington (adventurer)|Sir John Harrington]] to the border region between [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] and [[Sudan]] on the same day his medical qualification was announced. He returned to England and took a position at [[Royal Sussex County Hospital|Sussex County Hospital]] in [[Brighton]], and in 1907 left for [[Singapore]]. Forced to return to England on his father's death in 1908, he held positions at various hospitals in London until he moved to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1914 to work with [[William Osler|Sir William Osler (first Baronet)]], then [[Regius Professor]] of Medicine at the [[University of Oxford|university]].

===Later years===
Singer was married in July 1910 to [[Dorothea Waley Singer|Dorothea Waley Cohen]], distinguished in her own right as an historian of the Medieval period. She provided valuable assistance in his publications for the remainder of his life. In the period leading up to [[World War I]], Singer published several monographs, for which he was awarded the [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] degree by [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

Singer accepted a commission as [[Royal Army Medical Corps|medical officer in the British Army]] in 1916, first as a pathologist and then as part of an archaeological expedition. At war's end, he returned to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to lecture on the [[History of science|history of biology]]. In 1920 he was appointed to a lectureship in the [[History of science|history of medicine]] at [[University College London|University College]] of the [[University of London]]. He became president of the [[History of Medicine Society]] at the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in London, in 1920. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His reputation extended beyond England, and in 1929 he accepted an invitation to lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]] the following year. [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] was also interested in offering him a permanent post, but their delay allowed the [[University of London]] to award him an honorary chair, which he accepted. By the time [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] made their formal offer, he was satisfied with his position in [[London]] and declined their offer. The Singers spent time in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] where Charles spent three months as a visiting lecturer at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], after which they returned home to [[London]]. He was invited again by the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] to lecture in 1932, an occasion that the Singers used to circle the globe going westward, spending about sixteen months away from England. On their return, Singer resumed his post at [[University College London|UCL]], where he remained until his retirement in 1942. His last great publication before retirement was ''A Short History of Scientific Ideas to 1900''.

Singer was one of the two contributors to the revised and updated version for [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] of the bulk of [[Thomas Clifford Allbutt]]'s article ''Medicine'' which had been in the 11th edition. As revised for the 14th edition Singer's part was ''Medicine, History of'' (in volume 15), which followed after Sir [[Humphry Rolleston]]'s ''Medicine, General''.

Retirement was not idle for the Singers. Charles continued research into various topics and published several noteworthy books, including editing the monumental [[History of Technology (book series)|''A History of Technology'']], which was released in five volumes between 1954 and 1958, ''[[Galen]] on Anatomical Procedures'', and ''A History of Biology''. Numerous articles were also published in this period, some of which remain important.  He died in [[Par, Cornwall]].

==Award and recognitions==
Charles Singer's life was complemented by numerous awards, honors, and positions of leadership. Among these were an honorary degree [[Doctor of Science|(D.Sc.)]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and terms of presidency of several societies, including the [[British Society for the History of Science]] (1946-1948) and the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science|International Union for the History of Science]] (1947). He was also a member  of the [[International Society for the History of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;2001, Franz-Andre Sondervorst, ''Chronique de SIHM''&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife were co-awarded the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] from the [[History of Science Society]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Dorothea Waley Singer (1882-1964)|author=E.

[[File:Chronique de Frédégaire-deux personnages.jpg|thumb|Pen drawing from the earliest manuscript which is believed to depict [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]], 715&amp;nbsp;AD{{sfn|Monod|1885|p=25 fn. 1}}]]

The '''''Chronicle of Fredegar''''' is the conventional title used for a 7th-century [[Franks|Frankish]] chronicle that was probably written in [[Burgundy]]. The author is unknown and the attribution to Fredegar dates only from the 16th century.

The chronicle begins with the creation of the world and ends in AD&amp;nbsp;642. There are also a few references to events up to 658. Some copies of the manuscript contain an abridged version of the chronicle up to the date of 642, but include additional sections written under the [[Carolingian dynasty]] that end with the death of [[Pepin the Short]] in 768. The ''Chronicle of Fredegar'' with its ''Continuations'' is one of the few sources that provide information on the [[Merovingian dynasty]] for the period after 591 when [[Gregory of Tours]]' the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' finishes.

==Authorship==
None of the surviving manuscripts specify the name of the author.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=73}} The name "Fredegar" (modern French Frédégaire) was first used for the chronicle in 1579 by [[Claude Fauchet (historian)|Claude Fauchet]] in his ''Recueil des antiquitez gauloises et françoises''.{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=16}}{{sfn|Fauchet|1579}} The question of who wrote this work has been much debated, although the historian [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill]] admits that "Fredegar" is a genuine, if unusual, Frankish name.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960|p=xv}} The [[Vulgar Latin]] of this work confirms that the Chronicle was written in Gaul; beyond this, little is certain about the origin of this work. As a result, there are several theories about the authorship:{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960|pp=xvi&amp;ndash;xxv}}

* The original view, which was stated without argument as late as 1878, was that the Chronicle was written by a single person.
* In 1883 [[Bruno Krusch]], in his edition for the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', proposed that the Chronicle was the creation of three authors, a theory later accepted by [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Wilhelm Levison]], and Wallace-Hadrill.
* [[Ferdinand Lot]] critiqued Krusch's theory of multiple authorship and his protests were supported in 1928 by Marcel Bardot and Leon Levillain.
* In 1934, Siegmund Hellmann proposed a modification of Krusch's theory, arguing that the Chronicle was the work of two authors.{{sfn|Hellmann|1934}}
* In 1963, [[Walter Goffart]] renewed the notion of a single author,{{sfn|Goffart|1963}} and this view is now generally accepted.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}

Fredegar is usually assumed to have been a [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] from the region of [[Avenches]] because of his knowledge of the alternate name Wifflisburg for this locality, a name only then coming into usage. This assumption is supported by the fact that he had access to the annals of many Burgundian churches. He also had access to court documents and could apparently interview [[Lombards|Lombard]], [[Visigoth]], and [[Slavs|Slavic]] ambassadors. His awareness of events in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine world]] is also usually explained by the proximity of Burgundy to Byzantine Italy.

==Manuscripts==
The chronicle exists in over thirty manuscripts, which both Krusch and the English medievalist [[Roger Collins]] group into five classes.{{sfn|Krusch|1882}}{{sfn|Collins|2007}} The original chronicle is lost, but it exists in an [[uncial]] copy made in 715 by a Burgundian monk named Lucerius. This copy, the sole exemplar of a class 1 manuscript, is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (MS Latin 10910) and is sometimes called the ''Codex Claromontanus'' because it was once owned by the [[Collège de Clermont]] in Paris.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=209}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Frédégaire. Latin 10910 | url=http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ead.html?id=FRBNFEAD000072579&amp;c=FRBNFEAD000072579_e0000018&amp;qid=sdx_q3 | publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France | accessdate=24 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Diplomatics#Diplomatic editions and transcription|diplomatic edition]] was prepared by the French historian [[Gabriel Monod]] and published in 1885.{{sfn|Monod|1885}} The ''Codex Claromontanus'' was also the basis of the critical edition by Krusch published in 1888 and of the partial English translation by Wallace-Hadrill published in 1960.{{sfn|Krusch|1888}}{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960}} Most of the other surviving manuscripts were copied in [[Austrasia]] and date from the early ninth century or later.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|pp=527-528}}

The first printed version, the ''[[editio princeps]]'', was published  in [[Basel]] by [[Matthias Flacius|Flacius Illyricus]] in 1568.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|p=529}} He used MS Heidelberg University Palat. Lat. 864 as his text.{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=16}} The next published edition was ''Antiquae Lectiones'' by [[Theodorich Canisius|Canisius]] at [[Ingolstadt]] in 1602.

The manuscript was made available on the [[World Digital Library]] on December 20, 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wdl.org/en/item/20005/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In the critical edition by Krusch the chronicle is divided into four sections or books. The first three books are based on earlier works and cover the period from the beginning of the world up to 584; the fourth book continues up to 642 and foreshadows events occurring between 655 and 660.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=206}} In the prologue the author (traditionally Fredegar) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have most carefully read the chronicles of St Jerome, Hydatius and a certain wise man, of Isidore as well as of Gregory, from the beginning of the world to the declining years of Guntram's reign; and I have reproduced successively in this little book, in suitable languages and without many omissions, what these learned men have recounted at length in their five chronicles.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=210}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000749.html?pageNo=123&amp;zoom=1.00 123]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, Fredegar quotes from sources that he does not acknowledge and drastically condenses some of those he does. He also inserts additional sections of text that are not derived from his main sources. These inserted sections are referred to as "interpolations". For most of them the sources are not known.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}} Some of the interpolations are used to weave a legend of a Trojan origin for the Franks through the chronicle.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|pp=536-539}}{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=215}}

;Book I
The initial 24 chapters of the first book are based on the anonymous ''Liber generationis'' which in turn is derived from the work of [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]]. The remainder of the book contains a compendium of various chronological tables including a list of the Roman Emperors, a list of Judaic kings, a list of popes up to the accession of [[Pope Theodore I|Theodore I]] in 642 and Chapter 3 of the chronicle of [[Isidore of Seville]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|pp=211-212}} On the reverse of the folio containing the papal list is an ink drawing showing two people which according to Monod probably represent [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]].{{sfn|Monod|1885|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61061331/f35.image 25 fn. 1]}}{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=211}}

;Book II
The first 49 chapters of the second book contain extracts from Jerome's Latin translation of the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle of Eusebius]]. The text includes some interpolations. The remaining chapters contains extracts from the [[Hydatius#Chronicle|Chronicle of Hydatius]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=210}}{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}}

;Book III
The third book contains excerpts from Books II–VI of the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' by [[Gregory of Tours]] with several interpolations. Fredegar's source appears to have lacked the last four books of Gregory's text and his narrative ends in 584.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}}

;Book IV
The 90 chapters in the fourth book contain details of events concerning the Burgundian court. Fredegar does not reveal his sources but the earlier chapters are presumably based on local annals. Chapters 24–39 contain an accounts from witnesses of events between 603 and 613.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}} Chapter 36 is an interpolation on the life of [[Saint Columbanus]] that is copied, almost without change, from the ''Vita Columbani'' by [[Jonas of Bobbio]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=232}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|pp=134-138}} The book ends abruptly in 642.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}} Book IV has been the most studied by historians as it contains information that is not present in other medieval sources.

==Continuations==
One group of manuscripts (Krusch's Class 4) contain a reworking of the ''Chronicle of Fredegar'' followed by additional sections that describe events in [[Francia]] up to 768. These additional sections are referred to as the ''Continuations''. Krusch in his critical edition, appends these extra chapters to the text of the ''Codex Claromontanus'' creating the false impression that the two parts originate from the same manuscript.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000749.html?pageNo=168&amp;zoom=1.00 168]}}

Class 4 manuscripts are divided into three books. The first begins with a section based on the treatise ''De cursu temporum'' by the obscure fourth century Latin writer Quintus Julius Hilarianus. This is followed by a version of Fredegar's Book II incorporating an expanded account of the Trojan origin of the Franks. The second book is an abridged version of the histories by Gregory of Tours corresponding to Fredegar's Book III. The third and final book consists of the 90 chapters of Fredegar's Book IV followed by the ''Continuations''.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}

The ''Continuations'' consists of three part. The first ten chapters are based on the ''[[Liber Historiae Francorum]]'', an anonymous [[Neustria]]n chronicle that ends in around 721. The second part (Chapters 11&amp;ndash;33) covers the years up to 751. At this point a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] is inserted in the text explaining that the writing of the chronicle was ordered by [[Charles Martel]]'s brother, Count [[Childebrand]]. Wallace-Hadrill's  translation is:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;Up to this point, the illustrious Count Childebrand, uncle of the said King Pippin, took great pains to have this history or "geste" of the Franks recorded. What follows is by the authority of the illustrious Count Nibelung, Childebrand's son.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|p=528}}{{efn|The Latin text is: ''Usque nunc inluster vir Childebrandus comes, avunculus praedicto rege Pippino, hanc historiam vel gesta Francorum diligetissime scribere procuravit. Abhinc ab inlustre viro Nibelungo, filium ipsius Childebrando, itemque comite succedat auctoritas.''{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000749_00191.html?zoom=1.00 182]}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The chronicle then continues for another twenty chapters covering events in Francia up to the year 768.{{sfn|Fouracre|2000|p=7}}

The medievalist [[Roger Collins]] has argued that the text in the Class 4 manuscripts is sufficiently different from the ''Fredegar Chronicle'' of the ''Codex Claromontanus'' that it should be considered a separate work. He has proposed the new title ''Historia vel Gesta Francorum'' which occurs in the colophon mentioned above. He has suggested that one author was responsible for the text up 751, and that a different author probably wrote the additional chapters.{{sfn|Collins|2009a}}{{sfn|Collins|2009b}}

==Academic career==

Crowe began his career as a Russian specialist at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives of the United States]] in 1974 where he worked with Soviet officials who were seeking the return of Russian embassy and consular records seized by the U.S. after the Bolsheviks took power in late 1917. The following year he joined a special team of archivists in the Department of Defense that worked with the U.S. Senate’s [[Church Committee]] investigation of the U.S. intelligence community. This group also handled new [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and other requests related to the [[Vietnam War]] and other topics. Crowe returned to the National Archives in early 1977 as liaison to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

Later that year, Crowe accepted a teaching position at [[Elon University]] where he taught the history of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany, and modern Chinese history. In 2006, he was appointed Professor of Legal History at Elon’s School of Law where he taught courses on international criminal law and international criminal tribunals. Crowe also taught at [[Central European University]] in Budapest, Hungary and has lectured at the [[University of Heidelberg]], Germany; the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva, Switzerland; and the [[University of Bucharest]], Romania.&lt;ref name="elonlaw"&gt;{{cite web

==Academic Leadership==

Crowe was a Visiting Scholar at the [[Harriman Institute]] at [[Columbia University]] from 1998 to 2001, and a Fellow at the Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1997 to 2006. He was President of the [[Association for the Study of Nationalities]] from 1998 to 2004, and a member of the Education Committee of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] from 1990 to 2004. He was also a member of the North Carolina Council on the Holocaust and served as its chair from 1995 to 1999.&lt;ref name=chapman /&gt;&lt;ref name="elonlaw" /&gt;

==Consulting and Legal Work==

He has been a consultant to many national and international organizations dealing with programs designed to expand awareness of human rights issues, educational reform, and public awareness of such issues in Central and Eastern Europe. This included work with the [[United States Agency for International Development]] of the Rule of Law/Global Rights Initiative, Central European University’s Research Scheme in Prague, the [[Open Society Institute]]’s [[Romani people|Roma]] Cultural Initiative, and the [[DiploFoundation]]’s Roma Diplomacy Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Nicolae|editor1-first=Valeriu|editor2-last=Slavik|editor2-first=Hannah|title=Roma diplomacy|date=2007|publisher=International Debate Education Association|location=New York|isbn=978-1-932716-33-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 20 years, Crowe has served as an expert witness in numerous cases in the United States, Canada, and Israel dealing principally with asylum and extradition issues. He also organized the Conference on International Law: War Crimes, Human Rights, and Immigration at Elon University’s School of Law in 2012, and served as a judge for Elon's Billings, Exum &amp; Frye National Moot Court Competition in 2012 and 2013. He took part in the Silberman Seminar for Law School Professors, ''The Impact and Legacy of the Holocaust on the Law'', at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. from June 4–15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibbard|first1=David|title=Crowe chosen for law faculty seminar|url=http://www.elon.edu/E-NET/article/32818|accessdate=June 24, 2017|work=E-Net!

Over the years, Crowe has been the recipient or co-recipient of grants from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], the [[U.S. Department of Education]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and Elon University. In 2009, he was awarded Elon University’s first Senior Faculty full year research sabbatical, and three years later its two-year Senior Faculty Research Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Eric |title=Professors awarded 2012-14 Senior Faculty Research Fellowships|url=http://www.elon.edu/e-net/Article/57549|accessdate=June 24, 2017|work=E-Net!

In 2010 he received the [[Southern Conference on Slavic Studies]]’ Richard Stites Senior Scholar Award for Contributions to the Field of Slavic Studies.&lt;ref name="chapman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elonlaw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/scss/awards/|publisher=Southern Conference on Slavic Studies|accessdate=24 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===

Crowe’s books have dealt with a variety of subjects ranging from the evolution of [[international criminal law]], the history of national and [[international criminal tribunals]], [[the Holocaust]], 19th and [[20th century China]], international relations in Central and Eastern Europe, and the [[history of the Roma]] in Eastern Europe and Russia.

His principal works have been well-received. [[Romeo Dallaire]] wrote that Crowe did  “an exceptional job of research and writing on the crime of genocide and war crimes” in his ''War Crimes, Genocide, and Justice: A Global History'' (2014). It is written, he went on, “with the skill of the academic, the experience of the practitioner, but in the language of the layman.” [[Samuel Moyn]] added that it “provides an encyclopedic summation both of humanity’s propensity for atrocious evil and of its halting and inadequate search for accountability after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Book jacket comments, David M. Crowe, ''War Crimes, Genocide, and Justice: A Global History'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'' selected Crowe’s ''The Holocaust: Roots, History, and Aftermath'' (2008) as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2008, while former [[US Holocaust Memorial Museum]] director [[Michael Berenbaum]] wrote that it was a “detailed work that never gets lost in its detail” which “offers precision yet never loses sight of the larger story that must be told and retold.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=D. A.|title=Review: The Holocaust: roots, history, and aftermath|journal=Choice Reviews Online|date=December 2008|volume=46|issue=4|page=2306|doi=10.5860/CHOICE.46-2306|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.46-2306|accessdate=24 June 2017|publisher=American Library Association|quote=Crowe's book is the best overall text on the market today for college classes on the Holocaust. … Highly recommended.

[[Elie Wiesel]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Crowe’s biography of [[Oskar Schindler]], the Righteous Gentile made famous in [[Steven Spielberg]]’s ''[[Schindler’s List]]'', added complexity to the film without “’even altering the story.’” The result, he continued, was that ''Oskar Schindler: The Untold Story of His Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List'' (2004; 2007), “’made Schindler more human, and also more extraordinary.’”&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinitia Smith]], “A Scholar’s Book Adds Layers of Complexity to the Schindler Legend,” ''The New York Times'', November 24, 2004, pp. B1, B8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oskar Schindler'' was later chosen as a selection of the [[History Book Club]].

''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Crowe’s principal book on the [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsies), ''A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia'' (1998), “the most comprehensive and indispensable of its kind in English.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post Book World'', February 5, 1995, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Hancock]] said it was “remarkably thorough and compassionate,”&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Historical Review]]'' (October 1996), p. 1243.&lt;/ref&gt; while a reviewer in ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]'' wrote that it was a “clearly first rate” study that was “impeccably researched, extremely informational and well written. Most importantly, Crowe’s volume fills an obvious and long-standing void in the literature.”&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' (April 1996), pp. 460-461.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also chosen as a selection of the History Book Club.

In 2007, an updated, second edition of ''The History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia'' was published, which had a new chapter that dealt with the history of the Roma in each country discussed in the first edition, plus the new states that had emerged from the ashes of the former communist nations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Andre Liebich, who wrote the Forward to the new edition, called it “a path-breaking work of scholarship” that dealt with “a subject of considerable historical fascination and great contemporary relevance.”&lt;ref&gt;Andre Liebich, Forward, in David M. Crowe, ''A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia'', 2nd Edition (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowe’s other books include:

* ''Germany and China: Transnational Encounters since the 18th Century'' (2014; co-edited with Joanne Cho)
* ''Crimes of State, Past and Present: Government-Sponsored Atrocities and International Legal Responses'' (2011; editor)
* ''The Baltic States and the Great Powers, 1938-1940'' (1992)
* ''The Gypsies of Eastern Europe'' (1991; co-edited with John Kolsti)

'''David Roy Simmons''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE|size=85%}} (6 September 1930 – 30 November 2015), also known as '''Rawiri Te Puru Terehou''', was a New Zealand ethnologist, historian and author.

Born in 1930,&lt;ref name="Herald notice"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://notices.nzherald.co.nz/obituaries/nzherald-nz/obituary.aspx?n=david-roy-simmons&amp;pid=176704447 | title=David Simmons death notice | date=1 December 2015 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons studied at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]] and the [[University of Auckland]], graduating from the latter with a [[Master of Arts]] with honours.&lt;ref name="AWMM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/about-us/recent-news/2013/honours-for-researchers-advisory-panel-announced |title=Auckland Museum honours outstanding researchers, announces Research Advisory Panel |date=30 August 2013 |website= |publisher=Auckland War Memorial Museum |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962 to 1968 he was the keeper in anthropology at [[Otago Museum]] in Dunedin. He was appointed as the ethologist at the Auckland Institute and Museum in 1968, and became the assistant director of [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="AWMM"/&gt;

He wrote many books relating to [[Māori people|Māori]] art, culture and history, including: 
* ''The Maori Hei-tiki'' (1966) with [[Henry Devenish Skinner]] 
* ''The Great New Zealand Myth'' (1976)
* ''Tā Moko'' (1986)
* ''Whakairo'' (1994)

He is credited with effectively demolishing [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]]'s "[[Māori migration canoes#The "great fleet" hypothesis|great fleet]]" hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taonui |first1=Rāwiri |title=The meaning of canoe traditions |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/canoe-traditions/page-1 |website=Te Ara |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe puts it more strongly, stating that Smith's great fleet was "a fabrication", and that Simmons "also demonstrated that Smith manipulated tradition and other evidence to produce the story he wanted." [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/IdeasOfMaoriOrigins/5/en Ideas of Māori origins, 1920s–2000, New Understanding].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epoché''' ([[wikt:ἐποχή|ἐποχή]] ''epokhē'', "suspension"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29poxh%2F ἐποχή] in Liddell and Scott's ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[ancient Greek]] term typically translated as "suspension of judgment" but also as "withholding of assent".&lt;ref&gt;Benson Mates, "The Skeptic Way" p225&lt;/ref&gt; In its philosophical usage "epoché" describes the state where all judgments about non-evident matters are suspended in order to induce a state of [[ataraxia]] (freedom from worry and anxiety). This concept was developed by the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] school of philosophy and was also employed in [[Academic Skepticism]].

Epoché plays an implicit role in subsequent skeptical thought, as in [[René Descartes]]' epistemic principle of [[methodic doubt]]. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoché' or '[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]' in ''Ideas I''. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-red/#SSSH5a.i.1 "The Phenomenological Reduction"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyrrhonism==
Epoché plays an important role in [[Pyrrhonism]], the skeptical philosophy named after [[Pyrrho]]. Pyrrhonism provides practitioners with techniques for achieving epoché through use of the Ten Modes of [[Aenesidemus]], the Five Modes of [[Agrippa the Skeptic|Agrippa]], and the Pyrrhonist maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrhonism is mostly known today through the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] whose surviving works appear to be an encyclopedia of Pyrrhonist arguments for inducing epoché across a breadth of philosophical and other intellectual issues of antiquity.

==Phenomenology==
{{main article|Bracketing (phenomenology)}}
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological research]] epoché is described as a process involved in blocking biases and assumptions in order to explain a phenomenon in terms of its own inherent system of meaning. This is a general predisposition one must assume before commencing phenomenological study. It is different from bracketing, which is to acknowledge any personal bias or contextual assumptions of the researcher.  This involves systematic steps to "set aside" various assumptions and beliefs about a phenomenon in order to examine how the phenomenon presents itself in the world of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T.M., Brumfield, K.A. (2010). ''Phenomenological designs: The philosophy of phenomenological research''. In C.J Sheperis, J.S Young, &amp; M.H. Daniels (Eds.), Counseling research: Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ettore Ciccotti''' (Potenza, 23 March 1863 - Rome, 20 May 1939) was a historian, lecturer and politician from Italy, member of both the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Italian Senate]].

==Early life==
Born into a liberal family of the lawyer Pasquale Ciccotti, a landowner and several times mayor of [[Potenza]], he studied in the local high school. In 1879 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the [[University of Naples]]. He became a follower of [[Mazzini]] and adhered to [[Italian irredentism]]. He had a particular interest in both ancient history and for the social problems of Southern Italy, inspired by the example of the historian [[Giustino Fortunato]].&lt;ref name=ciccotti&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ettore-ciccotti_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Ciccotti, Ettore], Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 25 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciccotti, raised in the poor southern region of [[Basilicata]], adhered to the group of socio-political thinker's known as ''meridionalisti'' ("southernists"), aspiring to solve the economic problems of Southern Italy after the [[Italian unification]]. They claimed that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north.&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt;

==Academic and political activist==
In 1889, Ciccotti attended the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and gained a teaching qualification in classical antiquities. He won the competition for the ancient history chair at the Scientific-Literary Academy (''Accademia scientifico-letteraria'') in [[Milan]] in 1891. Meanwhile, he started to cooperate with the socialist [[Filippo Turati]] and his journal ''[[Critica Sociale]]''. He adhered to the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), where he raised the issue of the underdevelopment of Southern Italy. His political involvement caused him the hostility of the Milanese conservatives, and in 1897 he lost his position at the Academy.&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt;

He was appointed professor of ancient history at the [[University of Pavia]], but his attacks on the government and solidarity for the workers on the occasion of the [[Bava-Beccaris massacre|tragic events in Milan in May 1898]] earned him an arrest warrant for subversive incitement. He went into exile, taking refuge in [[Geneva]] (Switzerland), hosted by [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]]. Here he met [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and the German social-democrat [[August Bebel]], and wrote a report on the events in Milan, ''The revolt of Milan: Notes of a refugee'', but lost his job at Pavia.&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt;

As a historian, Ciccotti was the first to give a Marxist economic account of the decline of [[slavery]] in the [[Roman Empire]], in contrast to religious-ethical explanations in his book ''Il tramonto della schiavitu nel mondo antico'' (The Sunset of Slavery in the Ancient World), published in 1899. Economic changes rendered slavery expensive and inefficient, and doomed it to extinction.&lt;ref name=harrill48&gt;Harrill, ''The Manumission of Slaves in Early Christianity'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qj9bbRlnGUC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In June 1900, he was elected in the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] (1900-1904)&lt;ref name=senato&gt;{{it icon}} [http://notes9.senato.it/Web/senregno.NSF/4038162380009750c125703d004eed42/37e1be1305ce8d494125646f005a2d24?OpenDocument Ciccotti, Ettore], Senato della Republica (accessed: 1 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Vicaria]] district of [[Naples]], upsetting the traditional electoral alliance between local politicians and the [[Camorra]].&lt;ref name=snowden254&gt;Snowden, ''Naples in the Time of Cholera'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJca5ryvjJ0C&amp;pg=PA254 p. 254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, he lost his seat due to active campaigning of the Camorra against him.&lt;ref name=robba&gt;{{it icon}} Serena Robba (2009). ''[http://www.sapalessandria.org/Archivio/Memorial%20Day/Memorial%20day%202009/Borse%20di%20Studio%20Giurisprudenza%20AL/Tesi%20Serena%20Robba.pdf Camorra - uno stile di vita]'', Tesi di Laurea, Università degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale "Amedeo Avogadro"&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 1909 and remained a Deputy until September 1919.&lt;ref name=deputati&gt;{{it icon}}  [http://storia.camera.it/deputato/ettore-ciccotti-18630324 Ettore Ciccotti], Camera dei deputati, Portale storico (accessed: 1 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ciccotti initiated the translation in Italian of the major works of the Socialist theorists [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Ferdinand Lassalle]].&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt;

In the decade before the [[First World War]], he gradually distanced himself more and more from the official line of the Socialist Party, although he kept on contributing to the socialist newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]''. He criticized the party, which he considered to be too much focused on the problems of the "Northern", industrialist working man, and too little inclined to understand the problems of the impoverished rural populace of the South.&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt; Ciccotti defined the prejudices against southern Italians as the [[anti-Semitism]] of Italy.&lt;ref name=huysseune53&gt;Huysseune, ''Modernity and Secession'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pqMA6_QgD1gC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the PSI, he was in favour of an Italian intervention in the First World War.&lt;ref name=nyt061215&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/06/105049199.pdf Socialists Support War; Ciccotti Stirs Italian Chamber by Patriotic Speech], The New York Times, December 6, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senator and death==
His pro-war stance and dislike of the liberal [[Giovanni Giolitti]] – Ciccotti called Giolittianism the "death of political life"&lt;ref name=grand162&gt;De Grand, ''The Hunchback's Tailor'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fUvJCuQxmP0C&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162]&lt;/ref&gt; –, and in opposition to the [[Biennio Rosso|post-war revolutionary movements]], he looked sympathetically at the rising [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]] an its leader [[Benito Mussolini]]. "In today's evident scarcity of political personalities, Mussolini is the one that more than any other, if not the only one, can deserve this name," Ciccotti wrote in September 1922.&lt;ref name=falasca49&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, ''Fascist Spectacle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vcFQTOsRXgC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, he was rewarded with a seat for life in the [[Italian Senate]]. He opposed the move to authoritarian rule of Mussolini,&lt;ref name=nyt230539&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/05/23/93916633.pdf Senator Ettore Ciccotti; Noted Italian Historian, Long in Nation's Parliament, Dies], The New York Times, May 23, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; but did not resign. He mainly dedicated his time to study history. In 1931, when demanded to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, Ciccotti initially protested, but eventually took the oath all the same. Finally he opposed, and openly, to the dictatorship of Mussolini when he sensed that the regime was heading to the adventure of a war, which he considered the inevitable conclusion of authoritarian and populist regimes.&lt;ref name=ciccotti/&gt; He died in Rome on 20 May 1939 at the age of 76.&lt;ref name=nyt230539/&gt;

The '''extended evolutionary synthesis''' consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]] that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by [[C. H. Waddington]], argued for on the basis of [[punctuated equilibrium]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and [[Gerd B. Müller]].

The extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Uller|first2=Tobias|last3=Feldman|first3=Marcus W.|last4=Sterelny|first4=Kim|last5=Müller|first5=Gerd B.|last6=Moczek|first6=Armin|last7=Jablonka|first7=Eva|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=John|date=2015-08-22|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151019|journal=Proc.

Not all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in [[evolutionary developmental biology]], which concetrates on developmental [[molecular genetics]] and [[evolution]] to understand how [[natural selection]] operated on developmental processes and [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]].

==The preceding "modern synthesis"==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]]. However, it did not unify all of biology, omitting sciences such as [[developmental biology]].]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[Mendelian genetics|genetics]] in a joint mathematical framework. It established [[evolution]] as [[biology]]'s central [[paradigm#Scientific paradigm|paradigm]]. The 19th-century ideas of [[natural selection]] by Darwin and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were united by researchers who included [[Ronald Fisher]], one of the three founders of [[population genetics]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], between 1918 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Sciences |authorlink=National Academy of Sciences |year=1999 |title=Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024 |edition= 2nd |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academy Press |isbn=0-309-06406-6 |lccn=99006259 |oclc=43803228 |page=28 |quote=The scientific consensus around evolution is overwhelming.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis.

==Early history==

During the 1950s, the English biologist [[C. H. Waddington]] called for an extended synthesis based on his research on [[epigenetics]] and [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilkins | first1=Adam S | year=2008 | title=Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now | url=| journal=Biological Theory | volume=3 | issue=3| pages=224–232 | doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.3.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pigliucci | first1=Massimo | authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2006 | title=Phenotypic plasticity and evolution by genetic assimilation | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/12/2362.full | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 | issue=| pages=2362–2367 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?''

==1980s: punctuated equilibrium==

In the 1980s, the American palaeontologists [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]], the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and [[natural selection]] working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay.

==Contributions from evolutionary developmental biology==
{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

Some researchers in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] proposed another synthesis. They argue that the modern and extended syntheses should mostly center on [[gene]]s and suggest an integration of [[embryology]] with [[molecular genetics]] an [[evolution]], aiming to understand how [[natural selection]] operates on [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] and [[Deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[Conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]], [[transcription factor]]s and [[signalling pathways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61756485|title=The regulatory genome : gene regulatory networks in development and evolution|last=1937-2015,|first=Davidson, Eric H.,|isbn=0120885638|location=Amsterdam [Netherlands]|oclc=61756485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laubichler 2015" /&gt; By contrast, a different strand of evo-devo following an organismal approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bateson | first1=P | year=2005 | title=The Return of the Whole Organism | url=| journal=Journal of Biosciences | volume=30 | issue=| pages=31–39 | doi=10.1007/bf02705148 | pmid=15824439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huneman | first1=Philippe | year=2010 | title=Assessing the Prospects for a Return of Organisms in Evolutionary Biology | url=| journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences | volume=32 | pages=341–372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Opitz | first2=G. | last3=Raff | first3=R. | year=1996 | title=Resynthesizing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | url=| journal=Development and Evolution | volume=173 | issue=| pages=357–372 | doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0032 | pmid=8605997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=G.

===Testing===

The extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1=|title=Should Evolutionary Theory Evolve|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/04/evolution-templeton-grant.page|website=University of Southampton|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laland|first1=Kevin|title=Launching the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis project|url=https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24915-kevin-laland/posts/14200-launching-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis-project|website=Nature Research Ecology &amp; Evolution Community|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is headed by [[Kevin Laland|Kevin N. Laland]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and Tobias Uller at [[Lund University]]. According to Laland what the extended synthesis "really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/empowering-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/ "Empowering the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis"].

Biologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lindsay R.|date=2010-06|title=The So-Called Extended Synthesis and Population Genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/BIOT_a_00035|journal=Biological Theory|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.1162/biot_a_00035|issn=1555-5542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laland, Kevin, Tobias Uller, Marc Feldman, Kim Sterelny, Gerd B.

The '''Geoffrey Bilson Award for Historical Fiction for Young Readers''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] literary award that goes to the best work of historical fiction written for youth each year.  The award is named after [[Geoffrey Bilson]], a writer of historical fiction for youth and a history professor at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] who died suddenly in 1987.

The Geoffrey Bilson Award is selected by a jury chosen by the Canadian Children's Book Centre. Award winners must be Canadian authors, and the winning novel must have been published in the previous calendar year. Each year's winner receives a $1000 ([[Canadian dollar|C$]]) prize.

The award is one of several presented by the Canadian Children's Book Centre each year; others include the [[Marilyn Baillie Picture Book Award]], the [[Norma Fleck Award|Norma Fleck Award for Canadian Children's Non-Fiction]] and the [[TD Canadian Children's Literature Award]].&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2010/11/11/childrens-book-awards.html "Sask., Man. writers win for children's books"].

'''George Barnett''' (11 February 1876 – 10 April 1965) was an Irish historian, archaeologist, botanist, geologist, folklorist and poet. Self-taught, he acquired a vast knowledge of the [[Sperrins|Sperrin Mountains]] through experience, experimentation, observation, and traditional lore. He discovered many prehistoric sites, although he is best known for his discovery of the [[Beaghmore]] stone circles, and developed the theory that they were an ancient lunar observatory.&lt;ref name=EEE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=E.E.|title=George Barnett: An appreciation|journal=Ulster Journal of Archaeology|volume=29|pages=1–5|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was expressed in his poem, ''The Beaghmore Stone Circles''.

== The Beaghmore Stone Circles ==
&lt;poem&gt;
Ceremonial occasions they often had there,
They knew every day, aye, and week in the year,
For fifty-two weeks they had stones in a ring,
Thirteen in a line for the time the call Spring.

The same for Summer, that time of great joy,
Twenty-six for the Autumn and Winter stands nigh,
Four stones that are bigger stand up in a line,
For midsummer sunrise and midwinter time.

One stone by the circle's a day it appears,
Another convenient makes out the leap years,
You can soon make them out, if you look the place o'er,
Twixt the eastern circle and mighty big four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mawhinney|first=G.|title=Geordie's Jaunts: George Barnett's rhymes on his ramblings|publisher=Moyola Books|date=1996|isbn=1873345224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Field work==
Well known to academics for his extensive local knowledge and experience of the Sperrins, he assisted many field expeditions, and is recognised in the published findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartley|first=J.J.|title=The Geology of North-Eastern Tyrone and the Adjacent Portions of County Londonderry|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|volume=41|pages=193–283|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M'Court|first=D|title=The use of oral tradition in Irish historical geography|journal=Irish Geography|volume=6|number=4|year=1972|pages=394|doi=10.1080/00750777209479014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=A.T.|title=Furze-A survey and history of its use in Ireland|date=1960|page=394}}

==Pen name==
In the 1920s, he used the pen name G.B. M'Keown (M'Keown being his mother's maiden name), when writing notes for the weekly column 'Nature and Antiquarian Notes' in the [[Northern Whig (newspaper)|Northern Whig Newspaper]].

'''Gerhard Scholem''' who, after his immigration from Germany to [[Israel]], changed his name to '''Gershom Scholem''' ([[Hebrew]]: גרשום שלום) (December 5, 1897 – February 21, 1982), was a German-born Israeli philosopher and historian. He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of [[Kabbalah]], becoming the first Professor of [[Jewish Mysticism]] at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Magid, Shaul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/scholem/ "Gershom Scholem"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/scholem/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; His close friends included [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Strauss]], and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published.

Scholem is best known for his collection of lectures, ''[[Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism]]'' (1941) and for his biography ''Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah'' (1957). His collected speeches and essays, published as ''On Kabbalah and its Symbolism'' (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among both Jews and non-Jews.

==Life==
{{Kabbalah}}
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Gerhard Scholem was born in [[Berlin]] to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His interest in [[Judaica]] was strongly opposed by his father, a printer, but, thanks to his mother's intervention, he was allowed to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Talmud]] with an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi.

Gerhard Scholem met [[Walter Benjamin]] in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended only with Benjamin's suicide, committed while fleeing Nazi persecution in 1940. Scholem dedicated his book ''Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism'' (''Die jüdische Mystik in ihren Hauptströmungen''), based on lectures 1938&amp;ndash;1957, to his friend Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the [[Frederick William University]] in Berlin (today, [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]]), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew, and where he came into contact with [[Martin Buber]], [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]], [[Ahad Ha'am]], and [[Zalman Shazar]].

In Berlin, Scholem first befriended and became an admirer of [[Leo Strauss]] (their correspondence would continue throughout his life).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kenneth Hart (1997). "Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish Thinker" [editor's introduction], in: Leo Strauss, ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity'', ed. Green. Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|9780791427736}}. p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently studied [[mathematical logic]] at the [[University of Jena]] under [[Gottlob Frege]]. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in [[semitic languages]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]]. Less notable in his academic career was his establishment of the fictive [[University of Muri]] with Benjamin.

Scholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, ''[[Bahir|Sefer ha-Bahir]]''. Drawn to [[Zionism]], and influenced by Buber, he emigrated in 1923 to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], where he devoted his time to studying Jewish mysticism and became a librarian, and eventually head of the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. He later became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Scholem taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud.

Scholem's brother [[Werner Scholem|Werner]] was a member of the ultra-left "Fischer-Maslow Group" and the youngest ever member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], representing the [[Communist]] Party ([[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]) in the German parliament. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the [[Third Reich]]. Gershom Scholem, unlike his brother, was vehemently opposed to both [[Communism]] and [[Marxism]].

Scholem died in [[Jerusalem]], where he is buried next to his wife in the [[Sanhedria Cemetery]]. [[Jürgen Habermas]] delivered the eulogy.

==Awards==
* In 1958, Scholem was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in Jewish studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208115723/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and scholarship==

Scholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish [[mysticism]] with the approach of the 19th-century school of the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'' ("Science of Judaism"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as [[history]], [[philology]], and [[philosophy]]. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was "both recognizably Jewish and deeply German," and "changed the course of twentieth-century European thought."&lt;ref&gt;Times Literary Supplement, 10th April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on [[Kabbalah]]. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: "This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?" (Robinson 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;396)

The analysis of Judaism carried out by the ''Wissenschaft'' school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem:

* It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism.
* It did not consider the proper ''foundations'' of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing.

In Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of [[Halakha]], were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be [[Martin Buber]]'s personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the [[land of Israel]].

In the ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the ''Gegengeschichte'' of  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] he ended up including less normative aspects of the Judaism in the public history.

Specifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:

*During the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] period, [[monotheism]] battles [[mythology|myth]], without completely defeating it.
*During the [[Talmud]]ic period, some of the institutions—for example, the notion of the [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] power of the accomplishment of the Sacraments—are removed in favour of the purer concept of the divine [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]].
*During the medieval period, the impossibility of reconciling the abstract concept of God of [[Greek philosophy]] with the personal [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] of the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure of the living God. After this time, mysticism, as an effort to find again the essence of the God of their fathers, became more widespread.

The notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as [[Sabbateans|Sabbatianism]], was developed from the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]]. In order to neutralize Sabbatianism, [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] had emerged as a [[Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian synthesis]]. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement.

In the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism.

The historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to [[Walter Benjamin]], he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation.

==Debate with Hannah Arendt==
In the aftermath of the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised [[Hannah Arendt]]'s book, ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'' and decried her lack of "ahavath Yisrael" (solidarity with the Jewish people). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them. The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, made Scholem break off ties with Arendt and refuse to forgive her. Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he "knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and...when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.”&lt;ref&gt;''Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem'', ed. Steven E. Aschheim, 2001, University of California Press, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other Israeli and Jewish academics also broke off ties with Arendt, claiming that her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people in their time of need was appalling, along with her victimization of various Nazis. Before the Eichmann trial, Scholem also opposed Arendt's interpretation (in letters and the introduction to ''Illuminations'') of Walter Benjamin as a Marxist thinker who predated the New Left. For Scholem, Benjamin had been an essentially religious thinker, whose turn to Marxism had been merely an unfortunate, but inessential and superficial, expedient.

Various stories and essays of the Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were inspired or influenced by Scholem's books.&lt;ref&gt;Gourevitch, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2hIVwWOa4sUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA156&amp;lpg "Interview with Jorge Luis Borges (July 1966)"], in ''The Paris review: Interviews, Volume 1'', Macmillan, 2006.

[[Andorra]], officially the Principality of Andorra ({{lang-ca|Principat d'Andorra}}), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra&lt;ref&gt;''Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia##, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Principat de les Valls d'Andorra|links=no}}), is a sovereign [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[microstate]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Southwestern Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[Spain]] and [[France]].

==9th to 19th centuries==
Andorra claims it is the last independent survivor of the [[Marca Hispanica]], the [[buffer state]]s created by [[Charlemagne]] to keep the [[Islam]]ic [[Moors]] from advancing into [[Christianity|Christian]] [[France]]. Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. In the 9th century, Charlemagne's grandson, [[Charles the Bald]], named the [[Counts of Urgell|Count of Urgell]] as overlord of Andorra. A descendant of the count later gave the lands to the [[Diocese of Urgell]].

In the 11th century, fearing military action by neighboring lords, the Bishop of Urgell placed himself under the protection of the [[Lord of Caboet]], a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[nobility|nobleman]]. Later, the [[Count of Foix]] became heir to the Lord of Caboet through marriage, and a dispute arose between the Occitan Count and the Catalan bishop over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|pareage]] (''pariatges''), which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the [[Bishop]] of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] (Catalonia). The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form.  In return, Andorra pays an annual tribute or ''questia'' to the co-rulers consisting of four [[ham]]s, forty loaves of [[bread]], and some [[wine]].   Andorra's borders have remained unchanged since 1278.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/61/pdfs/andorra-e.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62NCeD4x4?url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/61/pdfs/andorra-e.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. Albert Pintat; President of the government of the principality of Andorra |publisher=61'st session of the United Nations General Assembly |date=September 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra was briefly annexed to the [[Crown of Aragon]] twice, in 1396 and 1512.

In 1505, [[Germaine of Foix]] married [[Ferdinand V of Castile]], thereby bringing the lordship of Andorra under Spanish rule. On taking over the kingdom in 1519, [[Emperor Charles V]] granted the lordship of [[Les Valls]], as it was then known, to Germaine of Foix’s line in perpetuity. Calvinist king [[Henry III of Navarre]], who was also count of Foix, in 1589 ascended the French throne as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and by an edict of 1607 transferred his role as co-prince of Andorra to the head of the French state.

In 1793, the French revolutionary government refused the traditional Andorran tribute as smacking of [[feudalism]] and renounced its suzerainty, despite the wish of the Andorrans to enjoy French protection and avoid being under exclusively Spanish influence.

Andorra remained neutral during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Napoleon restored the co-principality in 1806 after the Andorrans petitioned him to do so. French title to the principality subsequently passed from the kings to the president of France. In the period 1812–13, the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre (department)|Sègre]]).

==20th and 21st centuries==
In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12, 1934, an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

During [[World War II]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route from Spain into France. The [[French Resistance]] used Andorra as part of their route to get downed airmen out of France. 

In 1943, Andorra carried out its first execution since the 19th century: [[Antoni Arenis]] was executed for double fratricide by firing squad because a trained executioner was unavailable to operate the legal method, by [[garrote]].

In 1958, Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]]. It had been forgotten in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended [[World War I]] and so the conflict had been [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]], and both had legally remained at war.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1958/09/25/archives/world-war-i-ends-in-andorra.html World War I Ends in Andorra]", [[United Press International|UPI]] story in the ''New York Times'', 25 September 1958. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Long an impoverished land with little contact with any nations other than adjoining France and Spain, Andorra, after World War II, achieved considerable prosperity through a developing [[Tourism in Andorra|tourist industry]]. That development, abetted by improvements in transport and communications, has tended to break down Andorra’s isolation and to bring Andorrans into the mainstream of European history. Public demands for democratic reforms led to the extension of the franchise to women in the 1970s and to the creation of new and more fully autonomous organs of government in the early 1980s.

===Since the 1990s===
Andorra formally became a parliamentary democracy in May 1993 following approval of a new [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] by a popular referendum in March 1993. The new constitution retained the French and Spanish co-princes although with reduced and narrowly defined powers. Civil rights were greatly expanded, including the legalisation of political parties and the provision for an independent judiciary. Andorra joined a customs union with the [[European Communities]] (now the EU) in 1991 and was admitted to the UN on 28 July 1993. The country
has been seeking ways to improve its export potential and increase its economic ties with its European neighbours. The financial services sector of the economy is highly important because of Andorra's status as a tax haven and its banking secrecy laws.

The '''''Interlude of Youth''''' is an English 16th-century [[morality play]].[http://web.viu.ca/siemensr/www/teaching/tudorlyric362/youth.htm] It is one of the earliest printed morality plays to have survived. Only two or three copies of any edition are known to exist. Waley's edition of the work appeared probably about the year [[1554 in literature|1554]], and has a woodcut on the title-page of two figures, representing Charity and Youth, two of the characters in the interlude. Another edition was printed by [[William Copland]], and has also a woodcut on the title-page, representing Youth between Charity, and another figure which has no name over its head. The colophon is: "Imprinted at London, in Lothbury, over against Sainct Margarytes church, by me, [[Wyllyam Copland]]." A fragment of a [[black-letter]] copy of the interlude has survived at [[Lambeth Palace]].

'''Joan Cadden''' (born 1944) is [[Professor Emerita]] of medieval history and literature in the History Department of the [[University of California, Davis]]. She served as President of the [[History of Science Society]] (HSS) from 2006-2007. She has written extensively on [[gender]] and [[sexuality]] in medieval science and medicine. Her book ''Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture'' (1993) received the [[Pfizer Award|Pfizer Prize]] in 1994, from the History of Science Society, as the outstanding book on the history of science.

==Early life and education==
Joan Cadden received her B.A. from [[Vassar College]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Scholars and Guests|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/resrep9697/report_96_97.2.html|website=Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her M.A. degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1967, writing her thesis on ''De elementis: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire in the 12th and 13th Centuries.'' She completed her Ph.D. in history and philosophy of science at [[Indiana University]] in 1971. Her Ph.D. thesis was ''The Medieval Philosophy and Biology of Growth: Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas,  Albert of Saxony and Marsilius of Inghen on Book I, Chapter V of Aristotle’s ‘De  generatione et corruptione,’ with Translated Texts of Albertus and Thomas Aquinas''.&lt;ref name="Bibliography"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Chris | last= Africa|title=A Joan Cadden Bibliography|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1856&amp;context=mff|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=127–128|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cadden taught as an assistant professor in the Department of History of Science at [[Harvard University]] from 1971-1976.&lt;ref name="Berlin"/&gt; She was a visiting lecturer in history at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] in 1977-1978.&lt;ref name="Isis"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Back Matter|journal=Isis|date=1978|volume=69|issue=1|pages=155–158|jstor=230676|doi=10.1086/isis.69.1.230676}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught at  [[Kenyon College]] from 1978-1996.&lt;ref name="Berlin"/&gt; She was a Dibner Visiting Historian of Science at [[Purdue University Calumet]] in 1996-1997.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dibner Visiting Historian of Science Program Records, 1992-2001|url=http://sirismm.si.edu/EADpdfs/SIA.FA09-218.pdf|website=Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the [[University of California at Davis]] in 1996 as Professor of History.&lt;ref name="Berlin"/&gt;  Cadden served as President of the [[History of Science Society]] (HSS) from 2006-2007.&lt;ref name="HSSPresidents"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society Past Presidents|url=http://hssonline.org/about/governance/officers-and-committees/past-presidents/|website=History of Science Society|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired and became Professor Emeritus at UC Davis in 2008.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Cadden|url=http://history.ucdavis.edu/people/fzcadden|website=UC Davis Department of History|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work has been characterized as exploring the "seams of disciplines"—the connections between history of science, gender history, history of sexuality, social history, and intellectual history.&lt;ref name="Puff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puff|first1=Helmut|title=Homagium: Joan Cadden's "Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages"|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=122–126|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1855&amp;context=mff|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, she broke new ground, paying "particular attention to the cultural and social milieux these sources were produced in; to the assumptions and expectations of authors and readers; to questions of form, style, and presentation."&lt;ref name="Lugt"/&gt;

Her book ''Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture'' (1993) was groundbreaking in its examination of sex and gender, and has deeply influenced subsequent scholarship.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lugt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugt|first1=Maaike van der|title=Sex Difference in Medieval Theology and Canon Law: A Tribute to Joan Cadden|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=101–121|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1854&amp;context=mff|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cadden examines the discussions of sexual difference from [[Aristotle]] through the fourteenth century, revealing a wide range of ideas about sexual determination, reproductive roles and sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Katharine|title=Reviewed Work: The Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages: Medicine, Science, and Culture by Joan Cadden|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=1995|volume=28|issue=3|pages=551–553|jstor=4331368|doi=10.1007/bf01059393}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She finds multiple models of sexuality  in  writings throughout the middles ages.&lt;ref name="Hessenbruch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dreger |first1=Alice D. |last2= Schiebinger |first2=Londa |editor-last= Hessenbruch |editor-first=Arne |title= Reader's guide to the history of science |date=1998 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |location= London |isbn= 9781884964299 |chapter= Gender and Sex |pages= 287–288 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1wJeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287 |accessdate= 19 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged [[Thomas Laqueur]]'s assertion in  ''Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud'' (1990) that male and female were seen as "manifestations of a unified substratum" before the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Katharine|title=Cadden, Laqueur, and the "One-Sex Body"|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=96–100|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4774909|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadden addressed medieval discourse in all its "staggering complexity", an "interconnectedness of intellectual interests" that was "far from comforting" in its diversity.&lt;ref name="Puff"/&gt;

She went on to research [[Pietro D'Abano]] and to explore the complexities of medieval natural philosophers' understanding of homosexual desire in her book ''Nothing Natural Is Shameful: Sodomy and Science in Late Medieval Europe'' (2013).&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing Natural Is Shameful Sodomy and Science in Late Medieval Europe|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15155.html|website=University of Pennsylvania Press|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she recognizes its limitations, she uses the medieval term "sodomy" to avoid conflation with modern senses of the term "homosexuality". Discussion focuses around Aristotle's ''Problemata IV.26'' and its questioning of male-male sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Kuffner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuffner|first1=Emily|title=Nothing Natural Is Shameful: Sodomy and Science in Late Medieval Europe by Joan Cadden|journal=Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies|date=2014|volume=45|issue=1|pages=215–218|doi=10.1353/cjm.2014.0071|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274564348_Nothing_Natural_Is_Shameful_Sodomy_and_Science_in_Late_Medieval_Europe_by_Joan_Cadden|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has been described as "a sophisticated reflection on sex and sexuality."&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt;

==Awards==
Her book ''Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture'' (1993) received the 1994 Pfizer Prize for outstanding book on the history of science from the History of Science Society.&lt;ref name="Peek"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peek|first1=Wendy Chapman|title=Book Reviews|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date=1995|volume=50|issue=4|pages=563–564|doi=10.1093/jhmas/50.4.563|url=https://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/4/563.extract|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was the first book on gender studies and the first book in thirty years on medieval studies, to win that award.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica H.|title=Introduction to Tributes to Joan Cadden|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|pages=63–65|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1848&amp;context=mff|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work was celebrated at two sessions at the 44th annual [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] in 2009 by the [[Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship]]. The Medieval Foremothers Society honored Joan Cadden in the sessions “Thinking beyond the ‘Woman Writer’ in Reconstructing Women’s Intellectual Worlds,” and “(New) Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages: Medicine, Science, and Culture (A Roundtable).” These were later published in the ''Medieval Feminist Forum'' (2010).&lt;ref name="MFF"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Front matter|journal=Medieval Feminist Forum|date=2010|volume=46|issue=1|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1844&amp;context=mff|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Christoph Brotze''' ({{lang-lv|Johans Kristofs Broce}}) (1 September 1742 – 4 August 1823) was a German [[pedagogue]], [[artist]] and [[ethnographer]].

==Biography==
Brotze was born in [[Görlitz]], [[Electorate of Saxony]]. He studied [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at the universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], and was also skilled at technical drawing. He went to [[Riga]] in [[Livonia]] in 1768 and spent the next 46 years as a teacher at the Riga Imperial Lyceum.&lt;ref name=Garber&gt;{{cite web|last=Garber |first=Klaus |title=Brotze, Joachim Christoph |url=http://www.ostdeutsche-biographie.de/brotjo92.htm |publisher=OstDeutsche Biographie |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316224133/http://www.ostdeutsche-biographie.de/brotjo92.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period he collected historical data and depicted in drawings and paintings everything he saw around him in his everyday life, as well as most buildings and monuments of significance in Livonia, supplemented with extensive descriptions. Today his works are considered an extremely valuable source of information for historians.

{{nihongo|'''Kan'ei'''|寛永}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} after ''[[Genna]]'' and before ''[[Shōhō]].''  This period spanned the years from February 1624 through December 1644.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kan'ei''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 468;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperors and empress were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Mizunoo of Japan|Go-Mizunoo]]''-tennō''|後水尾天皇}}, {{nihongo|[[Empress Meishō|Meishō]]''-tennō''|明正天皇}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Komyo of Japan|Go-Kōmyō]]''-tennō''|後光明天皇}}.&lt;ref name="t411"&gt;Titsingh, Isaac.

==Change of era==
* '''1624''' {{nihongo|''Kan'ei gannen''|寛永元年}}: The era name was changed to mark the start of a new cycle of the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]]. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Genna'' 9, on the 30th day of the 2nd month. This era name is derived from '''寛'''広、'''永'''長 (meaning "Broad Leniency, Eternal Leader").

== Events ==

* '''1624''' (''Kan'ei 1''): Construction of the Hōei-zan temple began.&lt;ref name="t411"/&gt;
* '''November 4, 1626''' (''Kan'ei 3, 16th day of the 9th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 寛永三年九月十六日 --&gt;: [[Emperor Go-Mizunoo]] and the empress visited [[Nijō Castle]]; they were accompanied by Princes of the Blood, palace ladies and ''[[kuge]]''. Among the precedents for this was the [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō]] era visit of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]] to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s extravagant [[Heian-kyō]] mansion, [[Juraku-dai]] (which Hideyoshi himself would tear down in the 12th month of [[Bunroku]] 2).&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1626'''  (''Kan'ei 5''): The first ''[[Kan'ei Tsūhō]]'' (寛永通寳) cash coins were introduced in the [[Mito Domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/roberts/coins/Kaneibasics.html|title= Basics of distinguishing Kan'ei coins.|date=24 October 2003|accessdate=16 June 2017|work= Luke Roberts at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|Department of History - University of California at Santa Barbara]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shizuoka Izumika comp., Anasen Nyuumon Kan'ei Tsuuhou: Shin Kan'ei no bu (Shoshinkan: [[Tokyo]], 1997). (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]])&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1627''' (''Kan'ei 6''): The {{nihongo|"Purple Robe Incident"|紫衣事件,|''shi-e jiken''}}—the Emperor was accused of having bestowed honorific purple garments to more than ten priests despite the shogun's edict which banned them for two years (probably in order to break the bond between the Emperor and religious circles).

This was the first time since the visit of Iemitsu in ''Kan'ei'' 11, 230 years before, that a shogun had visited Heian-kyō. In ''Bunkyō'' 3, Iemochi was summoned by the [[Emperor Kōmei]]; and when he traveled from Edo to the capital, the shogun had 3,000 retainers as escort. (Ponsonby-Fane, p. 325.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on the 22nd day of the 9th month was held at [[Fukiage Palace]] the famous martial arts tournament of 12 bout, organized by Shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu, and held in the presence of the visiting Emperor. It entered in History under the name of ''Kan'ei Jōran Jiai'' and was judged by the two Kenjutsu instructor of the Shogun.

* '''1638''' (''Kan'ei 15''): The Christian revolt was crushed; and 37,000 of the rebels are killed. The Christian religion is extirpated in Japan.&lt;ref name="t411"/&gt;
* '''1640''' (''Kan'ei 17''): A Spanish ship from Macao brought a delegation of 61 people to Nagasaki. They arrived on July 6, 1640; and on August 9, all of them were decapitated and their heads were stuck on poles.&lt;ref name="t411"/&gt;
* '''1640-1643''' (''Kan'ei 17-20''): [[Kan'ei Great Famine]] forces an agricultural reform giving a greater independence to the farmers and the reduction of military spendings.
* '''1643''' (''Kan'ei 20''): An ambassador from the [[Joseon|King of Korea]] arrived in Heian-kyō.&lt;ref name="t412"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA412,M1  p. 412.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leandro Heriberto Caballero Fernandez''', also known as '''Leandro H. Fernandez''', (March 13, 1889 – 1948) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[historian]] who will serve as a precursor for later historians in the ranks of [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] and [[Gregorio F. Zaide]]. He is well known for being the first Filipino chairperson of the [[University of the Philippines]] Department of History. Notable among his works is ''A Brief History of the Philippines'', a textbook for Grade 7 students during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American period]].

==Early life==
Fernandez was born on March 13, 1889 at [[Pagsanjan, Laguna]]. He studied first at Pagsawitan Elementary School, then at Laguna Provincial High School. He also studied at [[Manila High School (Intramuros)|Manila High School]]. As a ''pensionado'', he was sent to the [[United States]] to study. In 1910, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Pedagogy at Tri-State College in [[Indiana]]. In 1912, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Philosophy. In 1913, he garnered his Master of Arts in History at the [[University of Chicago]] and his Ph.D. in history at [[Columbia University]]. His dissertation is entitled ''The Philippine Republic'', later to be published by [[Yale University]].

==Later career==
Fernandez began his academic career as an instructor of history at the [[University of the Philippines]] Department of History in 1914. In 1921, he became a full professor. In 1926, he succeeded [[Austin Craig]] to become the first Filipino chairperson of the [[University of the Philippines]] Department of History. He would also become the longest serving chairperson when his service as chairperson ended in 1947. While serving as chairperson of the department, he also served as University Registrar in 1927 and Dean of the College of Liberal Arts from 1934 to 1947. In 1933, he succeeded Maximo Kalaw as editor of the Philippine Social Science Review. In 1941, he was one of the founding members of the Philippine National Historical Association. In 1948, Fernandez died in his home in [[Pagsanjan, Laguna]].

'''Marcel Alfons Gilbert van Meerhaeghe''' (Wetteren, April 12, 1921 &amp;ndash; [[Ghent]], March 22, 2014) was a Belgian economist, professor, publicist and columnist.

[[w:nl:M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe|M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe]] was Professor of International Economic Relations at the State University of Ghent.

In his long and distinguished career, Professor van Meerhaeghe gave important contributions to economics and also to the interpretation of economic events. His rare ability to combine theoretical and practical analyses made particularly valuable his scientific works.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary by Professor Domenico [[w:it:Attilio da Empoli|da Empoli]] (La Sapienza University, Rome) in ''Journal of Public Finance and Public Choice'' (from 1983 until 1997: ''Economia delle Scelte Pubbliche''), Vol. XXX, 2012-1/3, p.&amp;nbsp;123 (published in 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

=== 1939–1987 ===

Initially M. van Meerhaeghe thought about a military career. In 1939 he passed the entrance exams for the [[w:fr:École royale militaire (Belgique)|École Royale Militaire]] (ERM). After the campaign of 1940 followed about seven months as a prisoner of war in a German camp (an intervention of King Leopold III resulted in the release of the ERM-students).

At Ghent University (Belgium) van Meerhaeghe obtained a Masters degree in Economic Sciences in 1944 (first diet: July) and a Masters in Political Science and Sociology, also in 1944 (second diet: September). As regards the economics studies he attended the lectures given by Professor Raoul Miry who was the counterpart of Professor [[Gaston Eyskens]] of the University of [[Leuven]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin d'Information et de Documentation, [[Banque Nationale de Belgique]], Vol. II, N° 1, July 1937, editorial by [[Louis Franck (politician)|Louis Franck]] (Governor), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he obtained his PhD: ''Aviation in the traffic economy : the Belgian case in particular''.

In 1947 he became part-time lecturer political economy at the [[w:fr:Université coloniale de Belgique|Koloniale Hogeschool]] (Antwerp)&lt;ref&gt;M. van Meerhaeghe, ''De Economische Structuur van Belgisch-Kongo en Ruanda-Urundi'' (Ontwikkeling, Antwerp 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1955 part-time lecturer colonial economy at the University of Ghent.

Before becoming Professor of economics and international economics at the [[Ghent University|University of Ghent]] in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;''Sartonia'' ([[George Sarton]] Chair of the History of Sciences), Volume 19 (Academia Press, Ghent 2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;191–193.&lt;/ref&gt; he worked as economic advisor in the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;In 1945 he had started using data about the local economic policy in the town of [[Mechelen]].&lt;/ref&gt; as 'faculty advisor' of the [[NATO Defence College]] in Paris (1953–54) and as an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hesbois et al., ''Inventaire des archives de [[Jean-Charles Snoy et d'Oppuers|Jean-Charles, baron Snoy et d'Oppuers]]'' (1848-1961), State Archives in Belgium, BE-A0510 (Brussels 1988), pp. 96 and 183 (correspondence of 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest covered all types of international academic cooperation and face-to-face interaction, which is why in September 1959 he was appointed visiting professor at the Official University of Belgian Kongo and Ruanda-Urundi in [[Elisabethville]] for the courses ''Histoire des doctrines sociales et économiques'' and ''Histoire des doctrines économiques''.&lt;ref&gt;Rijksuniversiteit te Gent, ''Liber Memorialis 1913-1960'', Deel III (ed. by prof. Theo Luykx) pp.&amp;nbsp;216–218.&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a visiting professorship at the universities of Amsterdam in 1962 and Constantine (Algeria) in 1975, as well as becoming a visiting fellow at [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]], Cambridge in 1973.

Between 1961 and 1969 he was Vice-President and (since 1964) President of the Prices Commission, an advisory body to the Minister for Economic Affairs&lt;ref&gt;M. van Meerhaeghe, ''The Belgian Prices Commission'', [[w:de:Review of World Economics|Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv]], Hambourg, IC, Bd. 99, n° 2, 4. Trimester 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;257–273.&lt;/ref&gt; (replaced in 1969 by the ''Commission pour la régulation des prix'' : Royal Decree June 3, 1969).

Between 1962 and 1969 he was co-opted as a member of the ''[[w:fr:Conseil central de l'économie|Conseil Central de l'Économie]]'', the umbrella institution of the Belgian federal social and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;''Le conseil central de l'économie: Fonctionnement réel et activité, comparaison avec le projet de loi organisant la fusion du C.C.E. et du conseil national du travail'' (III), Courrier Hebdomadaire du Centre de Recherche et d'Informations Socio-Politiques, juin 1964/20 (n° 245-246), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1971 he was also a member of the board of the ''Belgian-Luxemburg Exchange Control'' (Institut Belgo-Luxembourgeois du Change),&lt;ref&gt;M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ''The Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union'', Tilburg, SUERF Series 54 A, 1987. (A series of papers about monetary politics and financial systems of the ''Société Universitaire Européenne de Recherches Financières'', founded near Paris in 1963.)&lt;/ref&gt; chaired by the Governor of the [[Belgian National Bank]]:&lt;ref&gt;Chambre des Représentants, Session 1974-1975, 19 novembre 1974, 277 N° 6, ''Projet de Loi relatif aux propositions budgétaires 1974-1975'', Rapport fait au nom de la Commission du Budget par M. d'Alcantara, Chapitre I : ''Contrôle des changes'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; until November 2002 when this institution was dissolved (Euro).

Between 1972 and 1980 he was a member of the ''conseil général'' of the [[w:fr:Caisse générale d'épargne et de retraite|Caisse générale d'épargne et de retraite]].

At its editors' request, van Meerhaeghe started a column in the Flemish business magazine [[Trends (Belgian magazine)|Trends]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;There, since 1978, he worked with [[Johan Van Overtveldt]] who later became the chief editor: J. Van Overtveldt, ''The Chicago School'' (Agate, Chicago 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; He also featured as a regular columnist in the newspaper [[De Standaard|The Standaard]] between 1988 and 1996.

[[w:nl:Luc Versele|Luc Versele]], since 2017 chairman of the Belgian bank [[Crelan]], was an assistent of Professor van Meerhaeghe at Ghent University.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Versele - de flandrien van het bankwezen, DURF DENKEN - Communitymagazine van de UGENT, January 2016, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

M. van Meerhaeghe was always steadfast in taking a strictly independent line of argument. By all means he was an individualist – one might say a 'loner' – concurring with the suggestion of A. Einstein that the ideal occupation for the theoretical scientist is that of a lighthouse keeper. Unfortunately, sometimes he was misunderstood by persons driven by ignorance, superficiality and envy towards the well-heeled.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heyrman, ''Inventaris van het archief [[André Vlerick]] (1919-1990)'', p. 187 (Kadoc, Leuven 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a rule of best practice that leads to controversy when publicly stated: «''A firm that puts the ethical considerations of other stakeholders such as employees first and business second could undermine the overall welfare of the firm and its shareholders/owners and even its employees''» (van Meerhaeghe quoted by Professor Tom Turner and Dr. Lorraine Ryan).&lt;ref&gt;T. Turner and L. Ryan, ''Corporate social responsibility and independent employee representation: A Case of ethical confusion and contradictions'', in Proceedings of the 11th Multidisciplinary Academic Conference (MAC Prague consulting s.r.o., Prague 2017), pp.&amp;nbsp;78–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant part of van Meerhaeghe's work belongs to what is commonly labelled as the American [[public choice theory|theory of public choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell S. Sobel and Jennis J. Taylor, ''The Last 30 Years of Public Choice: An Analysis of Author and Institution Rankings'', [[Public Choice (journal)|Public Choice]], September 2004, Volume 120, Iss. 3-4, pp.&amp;nbsp;331–352.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated great concern for a sound use of government means (struggle against [[Spendthrift|profligacy]]) and was favourable towards Taxpayers Associations (USA, Sweden, Federal Republic of Germany) that facilitate the contacts between the authorities and the public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ''Een bond van belastingbetalers?'' (Trends, March 1th 1979, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–58), quoted in Fr. Loeckx and R. Van Dionant, ''Eléments de la Science des Impôts'', Part 2 (Ministry of Finance, Brussels 1982), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emeritus ===

After his Belgian retirement on October 1, 1986&lt;ref&gt;''25 jaar Faculteit Economische Wetenschappen RUG 1968-1993'', eds. L. De Smet and J. Denduyver (Fac. Ec. en Toegepaste Ec. Wet., Ghent October 1993), pp. 6 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt; van Meerhaeghe was successively visiting professor in international economics and European integration at the Centre of International Studies of the [[Tilburg University]] (1987),&lt;ref&gt;''Economologues - Liber Amicorum voor [[Theo van de Klundert]]'', ed. by A.B.T. van Schaik (Tilburg University, Department of Economics, 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[London School of Economics]], London University (academic year 1987-88 – the Belgian Chair), at the university of [[Torino]] (1989-92: Professor Count [[Enrico di Robilant|di Robilant]] of the Faculty of Law; 1997-98: Faculty of Economics) and during the academic years 1993-95 at the university of [[Rome (La Sapienza)]].

In 1987-1988 he was 'Special Adviser to the Commission of the European Communities', more particularly to Mr Willy De Clercq, former Belgian Vice Prime Minister and a member of the [[European Commission|Commission]] (1985–1989: Commissioner for External Relations, responsible for international relations and foreign trade).&lt;ref&gt;At that time van Meerhaeghe was also a member of 'Europe-12 – Research and Action Committee on the EC', created in 1986. This committee published the series ''European Community Membership Evaluated''.&lt;/ref&gt;

M. van Meerhaeghe was member of the academic advisory council of the Brussels think-tank ''Institut Européen'' ([[Institutum Europaeum]] : 1979-2002)&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schumpeter, ''Methodological Individualism'', Michiel van Notten's translation of chapter VI of Schumpeter's (1908) ''Wesen und Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie'' (Institutum Europaeum, Brussels 1980), p. i.&lt;/ref&gt; and the think-tank [[Centre for the New Europe]] (1993-2009). At the last one he published ''The Information Policy of the European Commission'' (Vol. 4, Zellik April 1995).&lt;ref&gt;''Do Ideas Matter? Essays in Honour of [[w:de:Gerard Radnitzky|Gerard Radnitzky]]'', ed. by [[w:de:Hardy Bouillon|Hardy Bouillon]] (CNE, Brussels July 2001), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. [[Chris Tame|Chris R. Tame]], ''The Euro-Sceptical Directory'' (The Hampden Press, London 2002), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988 he was a Life Member of the [[Mont Pèlerin Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Van Offelen]], Mont Pèlerin Society - Inventory of the General Meeting Files 1947-1998 (Liberaal Archief vzw, Ghent 2004), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michiel De Vydt, ''Hayeks Historici: Een intellectuele geschiedenis van de Mont Pèlerin Society en Hayeks bekommernis om de rol van de historicus als opiniemaker'' (Universiteit Gent 2016), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1986 and 2009 he chaired the Board of Directors of ''Centrale Kredietverlening'' (CKV),&lt;ref&gt;[[Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (Belgium)|Commissie voor het Bank- en Financiewezen]] - Prudentieel Toezicht, Ciculaire D1 357 aan de revisoren (depositobeschermingsregeling), March 2nd 1995, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; a small savings bank.&lt;ref&gt;Annual report 2006 ([[Waregem]] 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

M. van Meerhaeghe is the author of 22 books (editor of 4 collective works) and about 160 articles.

===Theory must reflect reality===

Already early in his career (in an article of 1947&lt;ref&gt;M. van Meerhaeghe, ''Overzicht van de economische toestand van Belgisch-Kongo'', in Kongo-Overzee, XII-XIII, 1946-1947, nr. 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;287–313.&lt;/ref&gt;) he took a position: he opposed the numerous publications that have no relation whatsoever with reality («struggle for life»)&lt;ref&gt;See also M. van Meerhaeghe, ''De la théorie à la politique économique. La comptabilité nationale'', Industrie. Revue de la Fédération des Industies Belges, April 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–205.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially deplored the mania for addressing everything with mathematics. He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (''nützlich'').&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Goyens, ''Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG'', Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), September 1th 1986 (Special edition), pp.&amp;nbsp;24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Later he elaborated his criticism in ''Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion'' (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) [[Guy Routh]] wrote a favourable review in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, pp.&amp;nbsp;589–605): "Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation:&lt;ref&gt;Selectivity was indeed a characteristic of van Meerhaeghe: see e.g. the review of the textbook ''Economics'' of [[Richard Lipsey|R.G. Lipsey]] and [[Peter O. Steiner|P.O. Steiner]] by H.J. Klok in [[De Economist]], Vol. 115, Iss. 2, March 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;256–259.&lt;/ref&gt; a review of economic theory from Plato to [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]], with the faults exposed, in 109 pages of text. Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects." G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : "This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Joaquim Ramos Silva, ''Central tenets of economics as a moral science'', in Prof. António Romão, Manuel Ennes Ferreira (Eds.), ''Homenagem ao Professor Doutor Adelino Torres'' (Almedina Brasil, São Paulo 2010), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oort]], [[w:nl:Pieter de Wolff|P. de Wolff]] and [[w:nl:Henk Lambers|H.W. Lambers]]. The contribution of M. van Meerhaeghe (ed.) was the chapter on international economic policy. Professor P. Hennipman, arguably the finest Dutch economic theorist ever, dedicated his ''Welvaartstheorie en economische politiek'' (Samsom, Alphen a/d Rijn 1977) to M. van Meerhaeghe (p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref&gt;English translation : ''Welfare Economics and the Theory of Economic Policy'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, Aldershot 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lectures===

Teaching international economics results in delivering lectures at a variety of universities and international conferences: Warsaw (1961), Geneva (Conference on science and technology in promoting the development of developing countries&lt;ref&gt;R. Vandenbroeck - Rijksuniversiteit te Gent, ''Universitair Leven'', n° 54, May 1th 1963, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;), Pretoria (1964; Cultural Treaty between South-Africa, the Netherlands and Belgium&lt;ref&gt;Prof. dr.

==== Heilbronn Symposium ====

In order to understand economic problems, at all times the contemporary political, social, psychological and cultural factors have to be taken into account (the role of context: ''are the assumptions vindicated or wrongheaded'' ?). Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences&lt;ref&gt;A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].&lt;/ref&gt; because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that «far too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly» (p.&amp;nbsp;4). We mention :

* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter’s ‘Economic Development’'' in ''Joseph Aloïs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed. [[w:de:Jürgen Backhaus|J. Backhaus]], The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 1, Kluwer, Boston, Dordrecht, London 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;233–244. M. van Meerhaeghe considers [[Schumpeter]] as ‘superior’ to [[Keynes]] because of his better knowledge of the economic science and his unsurpassed ‘History of economic analysis’.
* ''The international aspects of Justi’s work'', in ''The beginnings of Political Economy. Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 7, Springer, New York 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–110. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. 
* ''Globalisation: concept, outcome, future – a continental view'',&lt;ref&gt;Written for the Heilbronn Symposia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Journal of Law and Economics]], April 2012, Vol. 33, Iss. 2 (Essays in honour of Dr. Reginald Hansen, °1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;239–306. Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes that nothing seems to halt the triumphant progress of globalisation.

===Selected articles===

Van Meerhaeghe was also a prolific author of acticles. A selection:

* ''The purpose of competition policy. A critical essay on the EEC's views'', [[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]], Wien, Band XXVII, Heft 4, Dezember 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;425–438.&lt;ref&gt;See also Parlement Européen - Direction générale de la documentation parlementaire et de l'information, Cahiers de documentation européenne, 10e année, n° 3, juillet - septembre 1968, p. 19/B.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Regional Policy of the European Communities'', The Maastricht ISINI-Papers (University of Maastricht),&lt;ref&gt;International Society for the Intercommunication of New Ideas (http://www.isini.info).&lt;/ref&gt; ed. Professor Gerrit Meijer, 2000, Volume II, Shaker Publishing.
* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;284–301.&lt;ref&gt;Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on "The Social Question", June 20–23, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''. Otto von Bismarck (at some time ambassador for Prussia in Saint-Petersburg) did not expect that the Social Question could be solved within a generation or two (p.&amp;nbsp;285). Although von Bismarck's position passed through many important alterations, one aim remains unchanged: guarantee the stability and social peace of the state.
* ''Capitalism and the 2008 crisis'', Journal of Public Finance and Public Choice, Vol. XXVI, 2008-2/3, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–181. This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective – essentially the absence of adequate regulation – and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early.

'''Mary Helen Agnes Allies''' (2 February 1852 – 27 January 1927) was a Catholic historian, writer and translator. 

==Life==
Allies was born on 2 February 1852. She was the eldest daughter of Thomas William and Eliza (born Hall) Allies. Her father had been a fellow at Oxford and he had risen to be the chaplain to the Bishop of London. He had however made a life-changing move to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1850.&lt;ref name="Gordon-Gorman"&gt;{{cite book|author=William James Gordon-Gorman|title=Converts to Rome : a biographical list of the more notable converts to the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOvFBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|publisher=William James Gordon-Gorman|pages=4–|id=GGKEY:A311XT8E38L}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her father was secretary of the [[Catholic Poor School Committee]]. She had five siblings and they lived in St John's Wood in London where it is presumed she was born. The family moved to [[Portman Square]] and Mary boarded at Holy Child College, a Catholic school in [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] operated by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus (later merged into their [[Mayfield School, Mayfield|Mayfield school]]), and subsequently Catholic boarding schools in Paris. Allies gave a lot of respect to her father and in time she would write his biography. She said that she fed "on the marrow of his mind" when she was the only child living at home. Her first work, ''The Life of Pius VII'', was published in 1875. It was well researched, but strongly pro-Catholic. The book looked at [[Pius VII|a supreme pope]] in conflict with the Napoleonic French state. [[Pius VII]]'s conflict included him being arrested. Allies' biography was based on sources in four languages. This, and the shorter version published in 1897,&lt;ref name="Allies1897"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary H. Allies|title=Pius the Seventh (1800-1823), by Mary H. Allies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gephQwAACAAJ|year=1897|publisher=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still (2004) the only available biography of Pius VII in English and is therefore a [[standard work]].&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;

Her next work was considered too pious and uncritical of her subjects. She wrote about the Dominican friar Saint [[Vincent Ferrer|Vincent Ferrier]], Saint [[Bernardino of Siena]] and the "Soldier Saint" [[John of Capistrano]]. Her next work was taken from the works Saint Augustine which was published in 1886&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; and this was followed up by his letters.&lt;ref name="Augustin1890"&gt;{{cite book|author=saint Augustin|title=Letters: Of Saint-Augustine, Selected and Translated by Mary H. Allies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBlFQwAACAAJ|year=1890|publisher=Burns and Oates}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim she published a book about another Catholic saint, [[John Chrysostom]], in 1889. A different title was ''The History of the Church of England'' which she published between 1892 and 1897. This was a partisan view of the Anglican church before 1603.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;

She translated an extract of [[John of Damascus]]'s ''De fide Orthoxa'' in 1898. When her mother died in 1902 and her father the following year she occupied herself writing a biography of her father,&lt;ref name=bio&gt;APA citation. Allies, M.H. (1907). Thomas William Allies.

'''Mykola Prokopovych Vasylenko''' (14 February 1866 – 3 October 1935)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_HGlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1085&amp;dq=Mykola+Vasylenko+1866&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZmKrNrLLaAhXiBsAKHR_hBkYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Mykola%20Vasylenko%201866&amp;f=false Profile of Mykola Vasylenko]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Ukrainian academician historian and law professor, important public and political figure. He was a temporary Otaman of Council of Ministers ([[Prime Minister of Ukraine]]), minister of Education, and director of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences ([[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]).

==Biography==
Mykola Vasylenko was born on {{OldStyleDate|14 February|1866|2 February}} in a village Esman (today a small settlement of [[Hlukhiv Raion]]). He finished a progymnasium in [[Hlukhiv]] and a full gymnasium in [[Poltava]]. After that Vasylenko studied at the history and philology faculty of Yuriev University ([[University of Tartu]]). In 1890 he defended his scientific work "Critical overview of literature from the history of regional assemblies" and became a candidate of Russian history.

Since 1890 Vasylenko worked as a teacher of history in Kiev gymnasiums, simultaneously working for the Historical society of Nestor the Chronicler. At the same time he attended lectures of [[Volodymyr Antonovych]], Volodymyr Ikonnikov, Oleksandr Lazarevsky and others in [[Kiev University]]. Vasylenko also was co-editor and published his scientific works in magazine "Kievskaya starina" (''Kiev olden''). In 1893-94 there appeared his first fundamental scientific works particularly the [[monograph]] "Servitude and the issue of servitude in Southwestern Krai".

During 1903-05 Vasylenko was a researcher for the Kiev Governorate Statistic Committee. He also was a member of Kiev Old [[Hromada (secret society)|Hromada]] as well as other public and cultural societies. Vasylenko was a sympathizer of the [[Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire]] and during the period he edited a newspaper "Kievskie otkliki" (''Kiev feedbacks''). For illegal fundraising to help workers of [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Kiev]], support of 1905 sappers revolt in Kiev, connections with revolutionary leaders, publication of articles of "anti-state" content in "Kievskie otkliki", Mykola Vasylenko was convicted to a year in prison which he served in [[Kresty Prison]] ([[Saint Petersburg]]). During his detention in Kresty, Vasylenko studied law and eventually passed the test of the Justice faculty program of Novorossiya University ([[Odessa University]]).

In 1909 he was admitted to [[Kiev University]] as an assistant professor ([[privatdozent]]). At the time Vasylenko was a member of secret public organization and political alliance, the Society of Ukrainian Progressors. In 1910 he received the academic degree of [[Master of Law]]. However, due to "political unreliability" the imperial administration prohibited him to teach in higher educational institutions. Therefore, Vasylenko worked as a fellow barrister for the Odessa court chamber.

Around that time in 1910 Vasylenko joined the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] that agreed to [[Ukrainian language]] in schools, courts, churches and promoted only the cultural autonomy of Ukraine. Affiliation to Kadets affected relationships of Vasylenko with activists of Ukrainian national-liberation movement.

After the [[February Revolution]] on initiative of [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], Mykola Vasylenko was invited to the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] on position of deputy chairman, but he did not actively participated in the council's sessions. On March 24, 1917 the [[Russian Provisional Government]] appointed Vasylenko as a curator of the Kiev school district and on August 19, 1917 he became a deputy minister of Education in the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. Vasylenko was supporter of evolutionary development of system of the Ukrainian National Education that did not correspond to the policy of Ukrainiazation of education, established by the I and II All-Ukrainian Teachers congresses and carried out by the General Secretariat of Education ([[General Secretariat of Ukraine]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14637">The '''Newark Holy Stones''' refer to a set of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] allegedly discovered by David Wyrick in 1860 within a cluster of ancient Indian burial mounds near [[Newark, Ohio]], now generally believed to be a hoax. The set consists of the Keystone, a stone bowl, and the Decalogue with its sandstone box.  They can be viewed at the [[Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum]] in Coshocton, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alrutz (1980). "The Newark Holy Stones: The History of an Archaeological Tragedy," ''Journal of the Scientific Laboratories, Denison University'', '''57''': 1-57. Copies available from [http://www.jhmuseum.org Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhmuseum.org/index.php/onview/permanent-galleries/205-newark-holy-stones|title= Newark Holy Stones|publisher=Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site where the objects were found is known as [[Newark Earthworks|The Newark Earthworks]], one of the biggest collections from an ancient American Indian culture known as the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] that existed from approximately 100 BC to AD&amp;nbsp;500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell Culture|publisher=Ohio History Central|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Decalogue Holy Stones.png|thumb|right|The Decalogue]]

The first of these artifacts, popularly known as the ''Keystone'' due to its shape, was excavated in June 1860.  Unlike other ancient artifacts found previously in this region, the Keystone was inscribed with [[Hebrew]]. It contains one phrase on each side:

*Holy of Holies
*King of the Earth
*The Law of God
*The Word of God

The second find came later in November 1860 when Wyrick and his excavation team came across a [[sandstone]] box which contained a small, black rock within it.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmuseum.org/decalog.htm |title=The UnMuseum:  The Decalogue Stones |publisher=The UnMuseum |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black rock was identified as [[limestone]] by geologists Dave Hawkins and Ken Bork of [[Denison University]].&lt;ref name="FederOthers2016a"/&gt; On this stone were carved Hebrew text that was translated to be a condensed version of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The name '''Decalogue Stone''', comes from the translation of the [[Hebrew]] letters that outline the religious and moral codes described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:2-17 and [[Deuteronomy]] 5:6-21, which refer to the Decalogue or [[Ten Commandments]].  The inscription begins on the front at the top of an arch above the figure of a bearded man who is wearing a turban, robe, and appears to be holding a tablet.  It runs down the left side, continues around all sides, and makes its way back to the front up the right side to where it began.  This pattern indicates that the inscription was meant to be read repetitively.  Right above the figure of the man is a separate inscription which translates to "[[Moses]]". This rock was carved with a unique form of Hebrew, which gave the appearance of ancient post-Exilic square Hebrew letters that later was shown to be derived from the modern Hebrew alphabet.&lt;ref name="FederOthers2016a"&gt;Feder, K.L., Barnhart, T.

==Radiocarbon date of wooden platform==
In 2014, Bradley Lepper of the [[Ohio History Connection]] discovered that a fragment of the wooden burial platform underneath which the Decalogue Stone was found had been preserved at Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]].  This sample yielded a [[radiocarbon dating|calibrated radiocarbon date]] range of CAL AD 70 to CAL AD 230 (95% probability).  Since the platform had been made from an approximately 2-foot diameter oak tree, the burial itself could have been several decades later than this tree growth.  These dates are consistent with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell culture]] that would have constructed the mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ohioarchaeology.org/documents/Article_1--Lepper_2015-final.pdf |title= A Radiocarbon Date for a Wooden Burial Platform from the Reservoir Stone Mound (33LI20), Licking County, Ohio |author =Lepper, Bradley T.

==Historical context==
The Newark Holy Stones are an archaeological fraud used to support the "Lost Tribes" theory, which posits an ancient Israelite presence in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohioarchaeology.org/resources/39-resources/research/articles-and-abstracts-2008/279-the-newark-qholy-stonesq-the-social-context-of-an-enduring-scientific-forgery|title=The Newark "Holy Stones": The Social Context of an Enduring Scientific Forgery|last=|first=|date=|website=Ohio Archaeological Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that there is a connection between the ancient Hopewell mound builders and [[Jewish]] settlers that were in the Americas before Columbus is a form of [[pseudoarchaeology]].

The first stone to be found was written in modern Hebrew. In July 1860 [[Abraham Geiger]] wrote in the [[New York Times]] that "the bungling work of an unskilled stone mason and the strangeness of some letters as well as the many mistakes and transpositions was his fault. The letters are not antique. This is not a relic of hoary antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepper|first=Bradley T.|author2=Kenneth L. Feder |author3=Terry A. Barnhart |author4=Deborah A. Bolnick |title=Civilizations Lost and Found: Fabricating History - Part Two: False Messages in Stone|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=November–December 2011|volume=35/6|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/civilizations_lost_and_found_fabricating_history_-_part_two_false_messages/|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just over three months later, the second stone was found. This was not only considerably more elaborate, it was written in archaic Hebrew. Ken Feder compares this with someone today announcing that they had discovered a hitherto unknown play by Shakespeare which was then exposed as a modern forgery, then shortly thereafter announcing the discovery of a more plausible new play.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', pages 192-193(Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the stones were forged to support a political viewpoint.  Brad Lepper, of the Ohio Historical Society who has extensively studied the Hopewell culture, suggests that the artifacts might have been scientifically forged to help advance the theory on [[monogenism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newarkadvocate.com/article/20100820/NEWS01/8200307/Glenn-Beck-mention-boosts-Newark-Earthworks |last=Hollon |first=Amy |title=Glenn Beck mention boosts Newark Earthworks |date=20 August 2010 |publisher=NewarkAdvocate.com |accessdate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823022750/http://www.newarkadvocate.com/article/20100820/NEWS01/8200307/Glenn-Beck-mention-boosts-Newark-Earthworks |archivedate=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1860, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was a subject of heated debate that was reaching a critical point in American society.  Anthropology and other forms of science were often used in defense or opposition.&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5954/Anthropology-History-of.html |title=Anthropology, History of |work=Jacksonian America and Polygenism; Types of Mankind, 1854, The Bureau of Ethnology |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussions promoting monogenism, for example, were often used to oppose slavery and segregation.&lt;ref name="jrank"/&gt;

==Hoax theories==

===David Wyrick===
Among some of the [[hoax]] theories is that Wyrick faked the artifacts and planted them at the excavation sites.  Prior to his discovery, Wyrick supported the belief that the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] were the ancestors of ancient [[Mound builder (people)|mound builders]] in Ohio.  Wyrick spent a great deal of time searching a number of excavation sites at various mounds attempting to find supporting evidence of this belief.  Some argue that Wyrick could have become more desperate as time went by providing the motivation to commit such an act.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1861, Wyrick published a pamphlet that described his account of the artifact discoveries.  The publishing included [[woodcut]]s of the inscriptions found on the stones. When comparing Wyrick's woodcuts of the Decalogue to the actual inscription found on the stone, Wyrick made at least 38 errors involving 256 Hebrew letters.  Mistakes include illegible and omitted letters.  Wyrick's depiction of Moses on the woodcuts had inconsistencies as well.  Wyrick shows Moses wearing a beret instead of a turban.  He also shows Moses in a 19th-century dress instead of the flowering robe shown on the stone.

Some believe that the person or group responsible for the inscription had to have an extensive knowledge of the Hebrew language. Given that Wyrick made a large number of mistakes on the woodcuts seem to indicate that he may not have been the stone's author.  Beverley H. Moseley, Jr., former art director of the Ohio Historical Society, compared the carving of Moses on the stone to Wyrick's woodcut copy.  He concluded that both images couldn't have been made by the same person. After Wyrick's death, [[Charles Whittlesey (geologist)|Colonel Charles Whittlesey]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whittlesey|first=Charles|year=1872|title=Archaeological Frauds: Inscriptions Attributed to the Mound Builders. Three Remarkable Forgeries.|journal=Western Reserve Historical Society Historical &amp; Archaeological Tract #9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1872 in which he recalls discovering a Hebrew Bible among Wyrick's personal items.  Whittlesey concludes at the time that the stones were a hoax, and assumed that the Bible was Wyrick's source of inspiration for the inscription.  However this theory was later discredited after it was determined that the letters used on the Decalogue did not represent a style that would have been consistent with the theory.&lt;ref name="Historical Society"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ohio History:  Ohio Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tmUk4_Oy-2wC&amp;dq=wyrick+%22hebrew+bible%22|year=1908|publisher=Fred J. Heer|location=Columbus, OH|pages=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew version used in the [[inscriptions]] is another point of contention. The version used was post-Exilic, which would be from a "Lost" Tribe.  Some believe this is another example that shows the artifacts were either a hoax or did not date back to the time of the mound builders.  Wyrick also made a claim in a letter he wrote to Joseph Henry in 1863—one year before his death—that he might have been a victim of a hoax.

===Rev. John W. McCarty’s and stonecutter Elijah Sutton===
Rev. John W. McCarty and Elijah Sutton were both residents of Newark when the Decalogue Stone and the Keystone were found. Elijah Sutton was a [[Stonemasonry|stonecutter]] with no other direct link to the event other than his part in carving Wyrick’s [[headstone]] when he died. However, it is asserted that because the Decalogue Stone is made from similar materials and is of the same width (thickness) as his headstones, he must have cut the stone. As for Rev. John W. McCarty, he played a more direct role in the artifact’s discovery.

It was with the help of McCarty that the stone was translated. Upon receiving the stone McCarty was able to translate it within hours. It is also likely that many Christian clergy supported the idea of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes]] myth during the 1800s, for it not only validated the Biblical tale of the Lost Tribes but also implied their religious right to continue colonize America and their Christianization of the Native Americans.

==Related discoveries==
There were other stones found at the Newark site, like the [[The Newark Keystone|Keystone]]. Two other stones were also found at Newark shortly after Wyrick’s death (they have since been lost). These stones were quickly dismissed as fakes when the local dentist, John H. Nicol, claimed that he had carved and introduced the stones to the site. 

A fifth stone was allegedly found at the same site as the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] stone two years later by David M. Johnson, a banker, and Nathaniel Roe Bradner, a physician.  Named the Johnson-Bradner Stone, it has since been lost. A lithograph of the stone, published in France, still survives.

[[File:1800 Wilkinson Map of the 4 Eastern Churches rectified.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Orient of the [[Roman Empire]] and its ecclesiastical order after the [[Council of Chalcedon]], 451]]
The '''Orient''' is a historical term for the ''East'', traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the [[Eastern world]], in relation to [[Europe]]. In [[English language|English]], it is largely a [[metonym]] for, and coterminous with, the [[continent]] of [[Asia]], loosely classified into the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]]: the directional regions now known today as western Asia, southern Asia, eastern Asia, and southeast Asia (Note that traditionally directional regions of a continent do not use an upper-case letter). Originally, the term ''Orient'' was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East.  
 
The term '''Oriental''' is often used to describe objects from the Orient. However, given its [[Eurocentric]] connotations and shifting, inaccurate definition through the ages, it is generally considered offensive as a label for people from Asia.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oriental|title=Definition of ORIENTAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oriental|title=oriental - Definition of oriental in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/oriental|title=Oriental definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weareresonate.com/2016/07/oriental-racist-term/|title=FEATURE: Why is 'Oriental' a racist term? - Resonate|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mike-francesa-oriental_us_59495b61e4b07d3e35d8b58f|title=New York Sports Talk Show Host Doesn't Get Why 'Oriental' Is Offensive|date=20 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tronc.com/gdpr/latimes.com/|title=Los Angeles Times - We are currently unavailable in your region|website=www.tronc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/avoid-these-five-racial-terms-2834959|title=Why You Should Avoid These Racial Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/outdated-term-oriental-has-no-place-at-city-hall-prof-1.711485|title=Outdated term 'Oriental' has no place at city hall: prof - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/bill-remove-oriental-federal-law-passes-senate-heads-obama-n571506|title=Bill to Remove 'Oriental' from Federal Law Passes Senate, Heads to Obama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
[[File:Roman Empire with dioceses in 300 AD.png|thumb|330px|right|Administrative Dioceses of the Roman Empire, c. 300, including the original [[Diocese of the Orient]]]]
The term "Orient" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''oriens'' meaning "east" (lit. "rising" &lt; ''orior'' " rise"). The use of the word for "rising" to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages: compare the terms "[[Levant]]" (&lt; French ''levant'' "rising"), "Vostok" {{lang-ru|Восток}} (&lt; Russian ''voskhod'' {{lang-ru|восход}} "sunrise"), "[[Anatolia]]" (&lt; Greek ''anatole''), "[[mizrahi]]" in [[Hebrew]] ("zriha" meaning sunrise), "sharq" {{lang-ar|شرق}} (&lt; Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yashriq}}'' {{lang|ar|يشرق}} "rise", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shurūq}}'' {{lang-ar|شروق}} "rising"), "shygys" {{lang-kz|шығыс}} (&lt; Kazakh ''shygu'' {{lang-kz|шығу}} "come out"), {{lang-tr|doğu}} (&lt; Turkish ''doğmak'' to be born; to rise), {{zh|東}} ({{zh|hp=dōng}}, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Harbaugh | first1 = Rick | title = Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary | chapter = 東 | publisher = Han Lu Book &amp; Pub. Co. | year = 1998 | page = 227 | url = http://zhongwen.com/d/170/x70.htm | accessdate = 26 October 2010 | isbn = 0-9660750-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "[[The Land of the Rising Sun]]" to refer to [[Japan]].  Also, many ancient temples, including pagan temples and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East.  This tradition was  [[Orientation of churches|carried on in Christian churches]]. To situate them in such a manner was to "orient" them in the proper direction.  When something was facing the correct direction, it was said to be in the proper ''orientation''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another explanation of the term stems from [[Rome]] during the [[Roman Empire]], specifically the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], or the "Roman Orient", during the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the original East-West (or Orient-Occident) line was the [[Italian Peninsula]]'s East Coast, around 600 AD this would shift to the [[City of Rome]]. Any area below the City of Rome was considered the Orient, as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land, such as [[Dalmatian Italian]]s, (modern [[Naples|Neapolitans]] along with [[Sicily|Sicilians]], [[Libyan people|Libyans]], [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]], [[Greeks]], etc.), as well as everything East of Southern Italy, hence the Italian name "Italia nord-orientale" (in English [[Northeast Italy]]) for Le [[Tre Venezie]] (the 3 Venices) located above the Roman latitude line separating it from modern [[Abruzzo]]; the beginning of the Orient in the East, while [[Lazio]] is its beginning in the West of the [[Italian Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The opposite term "[[Western world|Occident]]" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''occidens'', meaning ''west'' (lit. ''setting'' &lt; ''occido'' ''fall/set''). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favor of "[[Western world]]".

== History of the term ==
{{Further|Orientalism}}
[[File:Dioecesis Orientis 400 AD.png|thumb|270px|right|Late Roman [[Diocese of the Orient]], c. 400]]
Territorialization of the Roman term ''Orient'' occurred during the reign of emperor [[Diocletian]] (284-305), when the [[Diocese of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Orientis'') was formed. Later in the 4th century, the [[Praetorian prefecture of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Praefectura Praetorio Orientis'') was also formed, including most of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], from the [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]] eastwards; its easternmost part was the original ''Diocese of the Orient'', corresponding roughly to the [[region of Syria]]. 

Over time, the common understanding of "the Orient" has continually shifted eastwards, as European people traveled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call "the [[Far East]]". These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where "the Orient" and "Oriental" have kept their older meanings (e.g., "Oriental spices" typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travelers may again take the [[Orient Express]] train from [[Paris]] to its terminus in the European part of [[Istanbul]], a route established in the early 20th century.

In European [[historiography]], the meaning of "the Orient" changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], and adjoining areas.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Martin W.|last2=Wigen|first2=Kären|title=The myth of continents: a critique of metageography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2as0sWxFBAC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=8 November 2011|year=1997|publisher=University ù Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; as far west as [[Morocco]]. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered "the Orient" as just [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and eastern [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; As recently as the early 20th century, the term "Orient" often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], and peninsular Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; Throughout the history of the changing sense of the term, "the Orient" was never equivalent to Asia as a whole. "The Orient" being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia—[[Siberia]] most notably—were excluded from the scholarly notion of "the Orient".&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt;

Equally valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as [[Oriental studies]] (now Asian Studies in some countries).

The adjectival term Oriental has been used by [[Western world|the West]] to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. "Oriental" means generally "[[east]]ern". It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the [[Eastern world|Orient]] or "East" (for [[Asia]]), and especially of its [[Eastern culture]]. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated "Ori".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooke|Hooke, Robert]]. 1666. [[:File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|Drawing of Saturn]] in Philosophical Transactions (Royal Society publication) Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and look at old world maps and celestial for sources., and so on --&gt; In contemporary American English, ''Oriental'' usually refers to things from the parts of [[East Asia]] traditionally occupied by [[East Asian]]s and most [[Central Asians]] and [[Southeast Asians]] racially categorized as "[[Mongoloid]]". This excludes [[Jewish diaspora|Jews]], [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]], and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] prohibits the word "Oriental" in legislation and government documents, preferring the word "Asian" instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf Senate bill (pdf file)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305151322/http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more local uses, "oriental" is also used for eastern parts of countries, for example [[Oriental (Morocco)|Morocco's Oriental Region]]. Oriental is also used as an adjective akin to "eastern", especially in the Spanish-speaking world. For example, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] islands of [[Mindoro Island|Mindoro]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]] are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words "oriental" and "occidental" respectively. The official name of [[Uruguay]] is the República Oriental del Uruguay or Oriental Republic of Uruguay because it is east of the [[Uruguay River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html#Govt|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, "orientalist" has been the traditional term for a scholar of [[Oriental studies]]; however, the use in [[English language|English]] of "Orientalism" to describe academic "Oriental studies" is rare: the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites only one such usage, by [[Lord Byron]] in 1812. [[Orientalism]] is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in "Oriental" subjects, often drawing on their travels to [[North Africa]] and [[Western Asia]]. Artists as well as scholars were already described as "Orientalists" in the 19th century. In 1978, Palestinian-American scholar [[Edward Said]] published his influential and controversial book, ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]''; he used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]]s, shaped by the attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Nosal, K R.

John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at [[New York University]], said the basic critique of the term developed in the U.S. in the 1970s.

In 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation striking the word from federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/280751-obama-signs-measure-striking-oriental-and-negro-from-federal|title=Obama signs measure striking 'oriental' and 'negro' from federal law|last=Weaver|first=Dustin|date=2016-05-20|website=TheHill|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian English ===
In [[Australian English]], the term "Asian" generally refers to people of [[East Asia]]n or [[Southeast Asia]]n descent, such as those of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Filipino descent. Persons of  Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and most other [[South Asian]] descent are referred to by their respective [[demonym]], but without explicit knowledge, those people are indeterminately inferred as "Indian".

=== German ===
In [[German language|German]], ''Orient'' is usually used synonymously with the area between the [[Near East]] and [[India]], including [[Israel]], the [[Arab world]], and [[Greater Persia]].

The term ''Asiaten'' (English: Asians) means the people of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Another word for Orient in German is ''Morgenland'' (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as "morning land". The antonym "Abendland" (rarely: "Okzident") is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.

'''Paul and Pierrette Girault de Coursac''' are two French historians who specialise in the lives of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].

==Views==
Their works over nearly 30 years write that the king was never governed by his wife. His education was intellectually very complete. He had several lines which he followed throughout his reign, such as preventing civil war and anything that might trigger it. He was never governed by his ministers, and during the [[French Revolution]] he pursued a consistent policy, playing the game that had been forced on him. Marie-Antoinette's policy during this period was followed without his knowledge. The letters requesting help from foreign sovereigns and presented as from him were fakes from the queen, and his entourage and the [[armoire de fer]] was a pure invention of certain revolutionaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">'''Pavel Dmitrievich Golohvastov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Павел Дмитриевич Голохвастов, 27 February 1838 – 16 July 1892) was a Russian writer, historian, philologist, publicist-[[Slavophilia|slavophile]].

== Biography ==
Pavel Golohvastov was born on 27 February 1838. His father was [[Dmitriy Pavlovich Golohvastov]]. Pavel graduated from the [[Page Corps]]. In 1857–1858, he worked in the [[Moscow's main archive|Main Archive of the Minister of Internal Affairs]]; in 1858–1859, he served in the [[Asian department]]. Later, he served as a [[justice of the peace]] in [[Zvenigorodsky uyezd.|Zvenigorodsky uyezd]], and then was a managing director of [[Tashinskiy iron plant]].

In 1882, Pavel started his service as an official "for special orders" in the Minister of Internal Affairs under the direction of [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev|Nikolay Ignatyev]]. At that time he was already a well-known authoritative theoretic of [[Slavophilia]]. Together with another notable slavophile, [[Ivan Aksakov]], he participated in the preparation of the project of emperor's manifest that should have reanimated [[Zemsky Sobor]]. This project made [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]] furious, which immediately forced the resignations of both Golohvastov and the minister.

Since a young age, Golohvastov studied the history of the Russian people, especially the period of the [[Time of Troubles]]. His legacy includes extensive works (manuscripts mostly), many of which are about Zemsky Sobor. He published several articles in [[Russky Arkhiv]] magazine and in the publications of Ivan Aksakov. He was the author of the drama "Alesha Popovich, a performance in 5 acts based on the Russian fairy tales" (Moscow, 1869), which was warmly accepted by critics and made him famous among contemporary writers. According to [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]], the language he used in his works was heavy, with the strong inclination towards "samokovannii" (Russian: самокованный, self-forged) words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary in 86 vol|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1890–1907|isbn=|location=Saint Petersburg|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golohvastov married Olga Andreevna Andreevskaya (1840–1897), an illegitimate daughter of [[Evdokiya Rostopchina]] and [[Andrey Karamzin]] (colonel, a son of [[Nikolay Karamzin]], 1814–1854). She was brought up in Switzerland, in the family of a priest. Olga was close to the community of slavophiles too. As a writer, she was an author of a few psychological plays.

{{nofootnotes|date=November 2017}}}}[[Image:Plan archaeological.jpg|thumb|240px|fig 1.Typical single context plan]]
In [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]], a '''plan''' is a [[technical drawing|drawn record]] of [[feature (archaeology)|feature]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s in the horizontal plane.

== Overview ==
Archaeological plan can either take the form of 
* a "multi context" plan, which is drawn with many [[Archaeological context|context]]s on it to show relationships between these features as part of some [[Archaeological phase|phase]], or 
* alternatively a single context plan with a single feature is drawn . 

Excavated features are drawn in three dimensions with the help of drawing conventions such as [[hachures]]. Single context planning developed by the [[Museum of London]] has become the professional norm. The basic advantage of single context planning is context plans draw on "transparent perma-trace paper" can be overlaid for re-interpretation at a later date. 

''Multi-context Plans'' as opposed to single context plans can be made of complete sites, trenches or individual features. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of the plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known [[grid point]]s and height readings, taken with a [[dumpy level]] or a [[total station]] (see [[surveying]]). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation "in plan" as opposed to excavation [[archaeological section|"in section"]]. Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.

== Archaeological plan topics ==
[[Image:Context planning.jpg|thumb|Fig 2. edge of context conventions]]
[[Image:Cut conventions.jpg|thumb|Fig 3. Cut planning hachures]]
=== The grid ===
It is common and good practice on excavations to lay out a grid of 5m squares so as to facilitate planning. This grid is marked out on-site with grid pegs that form the baselines for tapes and other planning tools to aid the drawing of plans.  It is also common practice that planning is done for each context on a separate piece of perma-trace that conforms to these 5m grid squares.  This is part of the [[single context recording]] system ''(see Fig 1.)'' The site grid should be tied into a national [[geomatic]] database such as the [[Ordnance survey]]

=== Planning drawing conventions ===
Archaeological planners use various symbols to denote characteristics of features and contexts and while conventions vary depending on practitioner, the following are representative:

===Pre-excavation and base plans ===
On  sites with little stratigraphic depth, a pre-excavation multi-context plan is sometimes made of all visible features before any excavation is carried out.  This helps in planning strategy since problems of stratigraphy on rural sites are minimal as [[feature (archaeology)|features]] often [[cut (archaeology)|cut]] into the [[archaeological natural|natural]] minimizing issues of inter-cutting [[feature (archaeology)|features]]. Conversely, planning a multi-context urban site is difficult to achieve on a multi-context plan as the features and deposits when planned will obscure each other on the same planning sheet.

== Critics of pre-excavation planning ==
Pre-excavation plans have been critiqued as being of limited use on urban or deeply stratified sites and have also been attacked in professional archaeology where they have been described as a misused tool of the unscrupulous operators to give the impression the [[archaeological record]] for a given site has been dealt with adequately.

This critical  point of view contends, that  comparisons  between pre and post-excavation plans can demonstrate that a site has not been comprehensively excavated on the basis of a pre-ex plan alone.  In many cases there is a pronounced difference between the two phases of planning.  Although many features may be visible at ground level following machining, it is often the case that the true limits of features are not so initially discernible until the area of the feature is fully cleaned and subsequently excavated revealing further features and [[relationship (archaeology)|relationships]] lower in the [[sequence (archaeological)|sequence]].

'''''Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel''''' is a book by [[Minnesota]] politician [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] published first in 1883. It is a companion to the more well-known work ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]''.

==Author's arguments==
In ''Ragnarok'', Donnelly argues that an enormous [[comet]] hit the earth 12,000 years ago, resulting in widespread fires, floods, poisonous gases, and unusually vicious and prolonged winters. The catastrophe destroyed a more advanced civilization, forcing its terrified population to seek shelter in caves. As cave-dwellers, they lost all knowledge of art, literature, music, philosophy, and engineering. 

He cites as evidence 900-foot-deep cracks radiating outward from the [[Great Lakes]], and stretching for many miles away. He admits it has been proposed that ice-sheets caused these cracks, but suggests that this explanation is improbable, likening them instead to "cracks in a window which has been struck with a stone". If ice sheets could produce such cracks, he asks, why haven't similar cracks been found anywhere else on the globe? He adds to this a discussion of surface rocks in New York City, which seem to have undergone a radical chemical change—the [[feldspar]] has been converted into [[slate]] and the [[mica]] has separated out from the iron, as if they had undergone tremendous heat and pressure, as they likely would in the event that a comet struck the earth. He rules out other theories that could have caused this, such as [[nitric acid]] and warm rains, by stating that this is an isolated incident, whereas warm rains can occur at any time and place and there's no archaeological evidence for the nitric acid's origins. 

He indicates many legends and myths from various cultures, such as [[Zoroastrian]], [[Pictish]], [[Hindu]], and [[Ancient Greece]], that are all suggestive of a comet striking the earth, the earth catching fire, poisonous gases choking people, and floods and tidal waves swamping large areas. He also discusses early culture's tendency to [[heliotheism]], which he said evolved from gratitude to the Sun, after so many horrific days without it.

'''''Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England''''' is a book by '''[[Diana Muir]]'''. The [[Providence Journal]] called ''Bullough’s Pond'' "a masterpiece,"&lt;ref&gt;"An Epic History of New England," by [[Robert Whitcomb]], Providence Journal, Sept. 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Publishers Weekly]] called it "lyrical".&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly, April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts Center for the Book awarded the 2001 [[Massachusetts Book Award]] to [[Bullough's Pond]] for the author’s "engaging and accomplished storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massbook.org/reading_guides/reflections_bullough_pond_guide.pdf Massachusetts Center for the Book: A Reading and Discussion Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514011316/http://www.massbook.org/reading_guides/reflections_bullough_pond_guide.pdf |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==

Muir makes a complex, [[Malthusian]] argument for the origin of an industrial revolution in New England independent of the English industrial revolution.  Demonstrating that the economic model of  colonial New England was large families of children on small-hold farms, producing sufficient wealth not only to live comfortably but to enable all of the children to purchase farms, she argues that a crunch point was reached when cheap, unsettled land ceased to be available.  Focusing on the decades following 1790, she argues that families had accumulated wealth to set their children up on farms, but that land was not available until after the federal government broke the armed strength of [[Tecumseh]] in the Ohio country.  During that twenty-year period, she demonstrates the development of numerous innovative techniques in the early stages of [[Interchangeable parts]] manufacturing and precision tool manufacturing, the aspects of industrialization in which southern New England was to lead the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0352] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014034133/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0352 |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir argues that, "The Agricultural Revolution saved hunters and gatherers from starving after they wiped out their bigger prey and populations grew too big to be supported by remaining food supplies. The Industrial Revolution saved the Yankees from poverty, but it depended on fossil energy, the by-products of which are polluting the earth. Muir thus argues that a Third Revolution is now necessary, one that will entail the discovery and deployment of new kinds of energy and materials."&lt;ref&gt;"Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England" by Jenny Goldie, Sustainable Population Australia,  Sept. 2001, no. 51, http://www.multiline.com.au/~johnm/spa51.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interchageable parts===

Muir's most innovative argument is her tracing of the origins of [[Mass production]] manufacturing using [[Interchangeable parts]] to [[Eli Terry]] and the early Connecticut clock industry.  She outlines a chain of transmission from Terry's mass production of wooden clockworks, through clockmaker [[Elisha Cheney]] to [[Simeon North]], early mass-production gunmaker and inventor of the earliest milling machine capable of working metal.&lt;ref&gt;Reflections in Bullough's Pond, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-contact New England==

Muir’s treatment of Native Americans follows [[William Cronon]]’s understanding of native cultures as agents of change who interacted with the ecosystems they inhabited in complex ways.  Her innovation here is the use of archaeological data to argue that the [[Iroquois]] expansion onto [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture enabling them to support populations large enough to include a body of warriors that could hold back the threat of Iroquois conquest.

==Economic history==
“With New England as the frame of her loom, Diana Muir has used a single shuttle--the dynamic of increasing human population and finite natural resources --to weave the economic and environmental stories of the past four centuries in this corner of North America. Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England suggests that the region has, repeatedly, reached and then exceeded the population that could be sustained by then-current economic subsistence strategies. It illuminates how New Englanders, from indigenous inhabitants to contemporary denizens, have  answered the population-resource dilemma and, in doing so,  generated both intentional outcomes and unintended – and potent – consequences.”&lt;ref&gt;Debra Simes,  Page 34 of the Summer 2000 edition of Conservation Matters, the journal of the [[Conservation Law Foundation]]  {{cite web |url=http://www.dianamuir.com/default/BPConservation.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004004757/http://www.dianamuir.com/default/BPConservation.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual sections are devoted to farming, and to the machine tool and papermaking industries.

==Biography==

From an early age, he was fascinated with mechanical toys, whether making model aircraft on the nursery window sill, arranging layouts for model trains or taking clocks to pieces.  At school, he started making a [[3½ inch gauge]] [[live steam]] model of the 1830 ''[[Invicta (locomotive)|Invicta]]'' or ''[[Curly Lawrence#3½ inch gauge|Canterbury Lamb]]'' which he was now trying to finish.  In National Service, he obtained a commission as [[2nd Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Artillery]], ending up with the [[26th Regiment Royal Artillery|26 Field Regiment]] at Folkestone during the [[Suez Crisis]].  He was sent to Lydd-on-Sea to supervise the accommodation for Territorial units practising shooting on the [[Dungeness (headland)#Defence uses|Dungeness ranges]].  Mechanical interests at this time covered as well as the guns a small 2-stroke [[Excelsior Motor Company|Excelsior]] motor bike and a small [[Standard Motor Company|Standard]] car which needed a great deal of restoration.

Then followed the History Tripos at Cambridge and the acquisition of a 1924 [[Lancia Lambda]]. Through the need to restore this, he was introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Kenny who were prepared to allow impecunious students use of their workshop facilities near [[Long Melford]]. They were trying to preserve the steam engine at [[Stretham Old Engine|Stretham]] that once drained the Waterbeach Level.  Recovery from a climbing accident gave me the opportunity to research the history of this engine and the Fen area.  After completing the Dip. Ed. at Cambridge followed by a brief teaching spell, a years research into fen drainage at the [[Imperial College, London]], led to the award of its Diploma and the publication of his first book, ''Machines, Mills and Uncountable Costly Necessities''.

Through the support of Prof. Rupert Hall at Imperial, Donald Cardwell offered him a post of Research Assistant in his History of Science Department at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|UMIST]] to study the History of Textile Technology as well as assisting in launching [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|a science museum for Manchester]]. The proposed museum was supported by the City of Manchester, the University of Manchester and UMIST. In 1967, UMIST purchased 97 Grosvenor Street for demolition but agreed to allow one part of it to be used temporarily to start the museum.  In 1968, the three authorities found between them £12,670 p.a. to fund a lecturer in charge, two technicians and a secretary was well as all the other running costs. Because he had been collecting exhibits such as the Beyer, Peacock archives of their locomotive production and many more, He was offered the post of lecturer in charge. The first stage of the museum was opened on 20 October 1969 by [[Hervey Rhodes, Baron Rhodes]] of Saddleworth, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire.  It contained displays of steam and internal combustion engines, papermaking, printing, spinning and weaving, scientific instruments, clocks, electrical exhibits such as wireless sets, archives and much more.

His Chief Technician was Frank Wightman, an experienced [[millwright]], with a passion for the [[mill engine|steam engines that drove the textile mills]]. Manchester had been a centre for mechanical engineering with many internationally famous firms.  He realised that it would be possible to find small examples of machine tools like lathes or [[planer (metalworking)|planing machine]]s to show the basic principles.  Also many textile machines might be shortened to just a few spindles.  These would be easier to demonstrate.  So he decided to concentrate on mill engines of medium size that would still be impressive.  These could be demonstrated under steam from a modern [[package boiler]].

But this placed him in a dilemma even before the official opening.  Should they concentrate our efforts on that or collecting exhibits they could not display immediately but would be necessary in a permanent museum?  When they were offered a steam [[beam engine]] of around 1830 like those that would have driven the first cotton spinning mills, he decided to use Frank's expertise and dismantle it for storage.  Likewise he decided to accept the offer of one of the last steam mill engines ever built, the 1925 [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons|Galloway]] engine from [[Elm Street Mill]], Burnley which required all of Frank's skills to remove it.  This had to go into three different stores before the time came to re-erect it in 1983.  In 1972, the museum was able to expand into the whole of 97 Grosvenor Street so as many as possible of the exhibits were put into working order and demonstrated especially on Working Saturdays which attracted many visitors.  Between the opening in 1969 and closure of Grosvenor Street in 1983, over half a million visitors passed through its doors.

The [[Rocket 150|celebration of the 150th anniversary]] of the opening in 1830 of the [[Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway]] saw the acquisition of the original terminus at [[Liverpool Road railway station (Manchester)|Liverpool Road, Manchester]], by the Greater Manchester Council, and the decision to move the museum into that historic site.  At last it became possible to take the mill engines out of store.  Frank Wightman had passed on, leaving him as the only person who had seen them in their original situations.  He had to supervise first the preparation of plans for the construction of foundations then the actual erection of the mass of separate parts.  The total weight must have been around 400 tons.  For these engines to run again, there had to be installed services such as steam, water, condensing apparatus, drains as well as overhead cranes.  It is probably the most complex display attempted for a museum.  The Power Hall has been a major draw for visitors ever since, still being the most popular part of the museum.

At Liverpool Road, the opportunity was taken to expand into railway related exhibits.  He saw that they could complement the [[National Railway Museum]] by displaying locomotives that had been exported overseas by the many local locomotive building firms.  A cousin, Elspeth Quayle, who was a member of the Manx [[House of Keys]], introduced him to their Minister of Transport and so was arranged the return to Manchester of the Beyer, Peacock built [[Isle of Man Railway locomotives#No. 3 Pender|''Pender'']].  The sectioning of this locomotive has proved to be another big draw.  The British Overseas Railways Historical Society helped with the return of the Vulcan Foundry 4-4-0 locomotive from Pakistan.  The Netherlands State Railways presented the high-speed electric [[British Rail Class EM2|EM2 Class]] ''Ariadne'' built at Gorton with [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] electrics. It was designed originally to work between Manchester and Sheffield and then on to London when that part of the line might be electrified.  Perhaps his greatest achievement was securing and organising the return of the mighty [[South African Class GL 4-8-2+2-8-4|Beyer, Peacock 'GL' Class Garratt]] articulated locomotive from South Africa.  The logistics of moving this 120 ton monster from Johannesburg to Manchester were considerable, involving a visit by him to that country.

By this time in 1983, he was feeling the stress of many years overworking. So he took early retirement on ill-health grounds which gave two opportunities. One was to be trained to serve in the Church of England as an ordained priest and he have continued to help in local churches in the [[Mottram in Longdendale|Mottram]] deanery. The other was to contribute more books and articles on the history of technology.  These are listed in the bibliography. In the meantime, the museum has continued to expand and develop, becoming Manchester's chief visitor attraction. Since the opening at Liverpool Road in 1983, there have been around two and a half million visitors and in 2013 alone there were 643,000 visitors, drawn by the many working exhibits, the tradition started at Grosvenor Street

Richard married Bernice Pickford (née Parkinson) in August 2008 at the Church where they met and where he was curate, St Michael &amp; all Angels, [[Mottram in Longdendale]]. She died in 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">The '''Saskatchewan Archaeological Society''' is a society of amateur and professional archaeologists who encourage the preservation of archaeological artifacts and sites, publish, educate and assist the public in the interest of archaeological activities.  As well, the Saskatchewan Archaeological Society assists in the formation of local branches of archaeological communities such as the Regina Archaeological Society.  Many of the archaeology sites of Saskatchewan are of aboriginal ancestry and include rock paintings, habitation sites, [[medicine wheels]], as well as kill and processing sites. [[Archaeology]] focuses on the anthropological study of human history and lifestyle using artifacts.

==Saskatchewan Archaeological Sites==

According to the 'Map of Saskatchewan Archaeology', there are more than 20,000 archaeological sites in [[Saskatchewan]]. The Saskatchewan Heritage Branch of the Saskatchewan Government manages the archaeological site files. An introduction to some of the archaeological sites around and about Saskatchewan are:

The '''South-East Asian [[Theater (warfare)|Theatre]] of World War II''' was the name given to the campaigns of the '''[[Pacific War]]''' in [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]], [[British India|India]], [[Thailand]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Indochina]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. Conflict in this theatre began when the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[French Indochina]] in September 1940 and rose to a new level following the raid on Pearl Harbor, and simultaneous attacks on Hong Kong, the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand|Thailand]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] on 7 and 8 December 1941. The main landing at Singora (now [[Songkhla]]) on the east side of the [[Isthmus of Kra]] preceded the bombing of Pearl Harbor by several hours. Action in the theatre officially ended on 9 September 1945.

==Initial Japanese successes==
The Allies suffered many defeats in the first half of the war. Two major British warships, {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} were [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sunk by a Japanese air attack]] off [[British Malaya|Malaya]] on 10 December 1941. Following the [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand|invasion]], the government of [[Thailand]] formally allied itself with Japan on 21 December. Japan invaded Hong Kong in the [[Battle of Hong Kong]] on 8 December, culminating in surrender on 25 December. January saw the invasions of [[British rule in Burma|Burma]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] and the capture of [[Manila]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]].

===Malaya and Singapore===
Japanese forces met stiff resistance from [[Indian III Corps|III Corps]] of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], the [[Australian 8th Division]] and British units during the [[Battle of Malaya]], but Japan's superiority in air power, tanks and infantry tactics drove the Allied units back. After being driven out of Malaya by the end of January 1942, Allied forces in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], under the command of Lieutenant General [[Arthur Ernest Percival|Arthur Percival]], surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942; about 130,000 Allied troops became prisoners of war. The [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] was the largest surrender in British military history.

===The Japanese Indian Ocean raid===
The Japanese [[Indian Ocean raid]] was a naval sortie by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. Following the destruction of the [[ABDACOM]] forces in the battles around [[Java (island)|Java]] in February and March, the Japanese sortied into the Indian Ocean to destroy British seapower there and support the invasion of [[Burma Campaign|Burma]]. The raid was only partially successful. It did not succeed in destroying Allied naval power in the Indian Ocean but it did force the British fleet to relocate from [[British Ceylon]] to [[Kilindini]] near [[Mombasa]] in [[Kenya]], as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the Indian Ocean was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships. From May 1942, it was also used in the [[Battle of Madagascar|invasion of Madagascar]]&amp;nbsp;— an operation aimed at thwarting any attempt by Japan to use bases on the [[Vichy French]] controlled territory.

In 1942, [[History of Chennai#1750s to 1947|Madras City]] was attacked by a Mitsubishi [[Nakajima A6M2-N|Rufe]], (the Zero's seaplane version) operating from the carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2}} which dropped a single bomb near the [[Fort St. George, India|St. George Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usswashington.com/worldwar2plus55/dl05ap42.htm World War 2 Plus 55] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310044343/http://usswashington.com/worldwar2plus55/dl05ap42.htm |date=10 March 2012 }}.

===Japanese occupation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands===
{{Main|Invasion and occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II}}
The [[Andaman and Nicobar]] Islands (8,293&amp;nbsp;km² on 139 islands) are a group of islands situated in the [[Bay of Bengal]] at about 780 miles from [[Kolkata]] (known at the time as Calcutta), 740 miles from [[Chennai]] (known at the time as [[Madras]]) and 120 miles from [[Cape Nargis]] in [[British rule in Burma|Burma]]. On 23 March 1942 a Japanese invasion force seized the islands and occupied them until the end of the war.

On 29 December 1943, political control of the islands was theoretically passed to the [[Azad Hind]] government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. Bose visited [[Port Blair]] to raise the tricolour flag of the [[Indian National Army]]. After Bose's departure the Japanese remained in effective control of the Andamans, and the sovereignty of the ''Arzi Hukumat-e Hind'' was largely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] &amp; T. Harper ''Forgotten Armies. The Fall of British Asia 1941-5'' (London) 2004 p325&lt;/ref&gt; The islands themselves were renamed "Shaheed" and "[[Swaraj]]", meaning "martyr" and "self-rule" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col. [[A. D. Loganathan]], and had limited involvement with the administration of the territory.

'''RAF battle honours''':
* &lt;small&gt;CEYLON 1942&lt;/small&gt;
Qualification: For operations against Japanese aircraft and naval units by squadrons based in Ceylon during the Japanese attacks of [[Easter Sunday Raid|April 1942]].
* &lt;small&gt;BURMA 1944–1945&lt;/small&gt;
Qualification: For operations during the 14th Army's advance from Imphal to Rangoon, the coastal amphibious assaults, and the Battle of Pegu Yomas, August 1944 to August 1945.

==Indian Ocean naval campaigns 1942–45==
{{Main|Indian Ocean in World War II}}
The earliest successes were gained by mine laying and submarine warfare. The Japanese minesweeping capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare. British submarines based in British Ceylon operated against Japanese shipping.

It was only after the war in Europe was clearly coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again. Following the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944, forces from the [[Home Fleet]] were released, and the success of [[Operation Overlord]] in June meant even more craft could be sent, including precious amphibious assault shipping.

During late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in [[Sumatra]], such as [[Operation Meridian]]. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} was lent for the first attack by the United States. The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the American blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for Sydney to become the [[British Pacific Fleet]].

After the departure of the main battle forces the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of Burma, including [[Battle of Ramree Island|landings on Ramree]] and Akyab and near Rangoon.

==Command structures==

===Allied command structure===
At the start of the war the British had two commands with responsibilities for possessions in the theatre. [[India Command]] under General Sir [[Archibald Wavell]] the Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the [[Army of India]] and the [[British Far East Command|Far East Command]], first under Air Chief Marshal [[Robert Brooke-Popham]] and then from 23 December 1941 commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir [[Henry Royds Pownall]].

India Command was responsible for British India, British Ceylon, and for some of the time Burma. The Far East Command based in Singapore was responsible for Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and other British Far East possessions including, for some of the time, Burma.

A month after the outbreak of war with Japan on 7 December 1941, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] governments jointly appointed the British Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the [[Army of India]], General Sir Archibald Wavell, as Supreme Allied Commander of all "[[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|American-British-Dutch-Australian]]" (ABDA) forces in South East Asia and the Pacific, from Burma to the [[Dutch East Indies]].

However, advances made by the Japanese over the next month split the ABDA forces in two. After transferring the forces in Burma to the India Command, on 25 February 1942 Wavell resigned as commander of the ABDA and resumed his position of CinC of the Army of India. Responsibility for the [[South West Pacific Area]] passed to US General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as ''Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific''.

From February 1942 until November 1943 the India Command was responsible for the South East Asian Theatre. General Wavell was made [[Viceroy of India]] and General [[Claude Auchinleck]] became Commander-in-Chief of the India Command on 20 June 1943. In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asian Command to take over strategic responsibilities for the theatre.

The reorganisation of the theatre command took about two months. On 4 October [[Winston Churchill]] appointed Admiral Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] supreme Allied commander of the [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC). The American General [[Joseph Stilwell]] was the first deputy supreme Allied commander. On 15 November, Auchinleck handed over responsibility for the conduct of operations against the Japanese in the theatre to Mountbatten.

The initial land forces operational area for SEAC included India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Ceylon]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. Operations were also mounted in Japanese-occupied [[Sumatra]], [[Thailand]] and [[French Indochina]] (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos).

Initially SEAC commanded:
* [[British Eastern Fleet]] (based in Ceylon)
* [[British 11th Army Group]] (Commonwealth land forces; HQ in New Delhi)
* Air HQ India (New Delhi)
* [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] (CBI), (all US forces in theatre; HQ in New Delhi).

In October 1944, CBI was split into US Forces China Theater (USFCT) and India-Burma Theater (USFIBT).

On 12 November 1944 Eleventh Army Group redesignated by Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) combining Commonwealth and US forces,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} with an HQ at Kandy. On 1 December ALFSEA HQ moved to Barrackpore, India.

On 15 August 1945 responsibility for the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]] was transferred from the South West Pacific Area to SEAC.

SEAC was disbanded on 30 November 1946.

====11th Army Group====
British 11th Army Group ( November 1943&amp;nbsp;– 12 November 1944) was on paper the main Commonwealth army force in South East Asia which directed
* British Fourteenth Army
* [[British Army in Ceylon]] (Ceylon Army)
* [[Northern Combat Area Command]] under the command of [[Joseph Stilwell]].

On 12 November 1944 the 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia, still under SEAC, because it was felt that an inter-Allied command was better than the purely British headquarters. Command problems with General Stilwell and his interactions with the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] had precipitated the change.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Unit controlling all army land and air units in South East Asia and the South West Pacific was the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group|Southern Expeditionary Army]] headquartered in [[Saigon]], [[French Indochina|Indochina]]. It was commanded by General Count [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], who commanded it from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese also deployed the [[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|South Seas Force]], a combined force of Army and [[Special Naval Landing Force]] personnel. The Southern Army's major field commands were the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|14th Army]], the [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|15th Army]], the [[Sixteenth Army (Japan)|16th Army]] and the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|25th Army]]. These consisted of 11 infantry divisions, six independent infantry brigades, and six tank regiments, plus artillery and support troops. The Japanese extensively used [[bicycle infantry]], which allowed them quick movement over vast distances.

'''Theodor von Sickel''' (18 December 1826 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1908) was a German-Austrian [[historian]] born in [[Aken (Elbe)|Aken]], [[Province of Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. He specialized in early European [[medieval history]], and is considered to be the founder of modern [[diplomatics]] (critical document research).

In 1850 he obtained his doctorate from the [[University of Halle]], then furthered his studies at the [[École Nationale des Chartes]] in [[Paris]]. In 1857 he was appointed professor at the [[University of Vienna]], and from 1869 to 1891, he was director of the ''Institut für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung'' (Institute of Austrian Historical Research), specializing in [[auxiliary sciences of history|ancillary branches of historical study]], that included [[paleography]], [[chronology]] and [[diplomatics]].

From 1875 he was a member of the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]], of which, he subsequently became head of its ''[[diplomatics|diplomata]]'' section. In this capacity, he performed meticulous and expert edition of medieval documents, including over 1300 royal documents of the 10th century (''Diplomata regum et imperatorum Germaniae'').

In 1881 he established the ''Österreichisches Historisches Institut'' (Austrian Historical Institute) in [[Rome]], serving as its director until 1901. From 1897 to 1908, he was president of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]].

!Decade
!Description
|-
|1970s - 1980s
|The [[PLATO system]] (developed at the [[University of Illinois]] and subsequently commercially marketed by [[Control Data Corporation]]) offers early forms of social media with Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; [[Talkomatic]], perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a notesfile or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea of [[Usenet]] in 1979 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]], and it was established in 1980.
|-
|1980s - 1990s
|As [[operating system]]s with a [[graphical user interface]], such as [[Windows 95]] and [[classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] begin to emerge and gain popularity, this created an environment that allows for early social media platforms to thrive and exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/windows-95-remains-most-popular-operating-system/|title=Windows 95 remains most popular operating system|website=CNET|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/operating-systems/happy-birthday-windows-95-the-os-that-changed-it-all-711984|title=Happy birthday, Windows 95 - the OS that changed it all|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bulletin board system]]s (BBS) and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) were popular during this time period, and IRC is still widely used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbscorner.com/usersinfo/bbshistory.htm|title=The BBS Corner - Main Page|website=www.bbscorner.com|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/06/irc-has-lost-60-of-its-users-since-2003-but-life-as-a-robot-is-just-beginning/|title=IRC Has Lost 60% Of Its Users Since 2003, But Life As A Robot Is Just Beginning|last=Williams|first=Alex|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1990s - 2000s
|Various notable social media platforms such as [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] are developed and released, and [[blog]]ging begins to gain popularity. [[Instant messaging]] platforms such as [[AOL Instant Messenger]] (AIM) and [[Windows Live Messenger]] also become increasingly popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/10/22/instant-messengers/|title=The Rise and Fall of Instant Messengers|date=2014-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] is launched in 2001.
|-
|2010s
|Many social media platforms that have remained are now thriving, and new ones are appearing sporadically. This includes popular blogs, instant messaging servers, and various [[Social networking service|social networking]] platforms such as Facebook, [[LinkedIn]], MySpace, and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
With advances in [[smartphone]] technology, almost all social media services now have their own [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

!Event type
!Description
|-
|1973
|Invention
|[[Talkomatic]] is created by Dave Woolley and Douglas Brown at the University of Illinois, as a multi-user chat room application. It is an instant sensation among users in the [[PLATO System]]'s online community.
|-
|1973
|Invention
|TERM-Talk is created by the staff at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, as an instant-messaging application enabling any two users on the [[PLATO system]] to conduct a live, character-by-character typed conversation on the bottom of the screen of their PLATO terminals. Soon many features would be added to it including "Monitor Mode," enabling one user in the TERM-talk to share their own screen with the other user, to ask questions or point out something that they're seeing. Years later this concept would be introduced as "Screen Sharing" or [[Remote Desktop Software]].
|-
|1973
|Invention
|PLATO Notes is created by 17-year-old student Dave Woolley at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, as a conferencing and bulletin board forum system for communicating with the user community. In 1976, Notes expanded to enable any user to create a "notesfile" on any subject. PLATO Notes would serve as the inspiration for [[Lotus Notes]] developed by former PLATO users Ray Ozzie, Len Kawell, and Tim Halvorsen.

The British [[counter-culture]] or [[underground scene]] developed during the mid 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/30/underground-arts-60s-rebel-counterculture|title=Spirit of the underground: the 60s rebel|author=Barry Miles|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 Jan 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was linked to the [[hippie]] and [[subculture]] of the [[United States]]. Its primary focus was around [[Ladbroke Grove]] and [[Notting Hill]] in [[London]]. It generated its own magazines and newspapers, bands, clubs and alternative lifestyle, associated with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[LSD]] use and a strong socio-political revolutionary agenda to create an alternative society.

==Beatnik influence==
Many in the blossoming underground movement were influenced by 1950s Beatnik [[Beat generation]] writers such as [[William Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], who paved the way for the [[hippie]]s and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. During the 1960s, the Beatnik writers engaged in symbiotic evolution with freethinking academics including experimental [[psychologist]] [[Timothy Leary]].

An example of the cross-over of beatnik poetry and music can be seen when Burroughs appeared at the [[Phun City]] festival, organised in 24–26 July 1970 by [[Mick Farren]] with underground community bands including [[The Pretty Things]], the [[Pink Fairies]], the [[Edgar Broughton Band]] and, from the United States, the [[MC5]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Note: I have simply cut and pasted this here from a merge-candidate article. This WILL need to be severely trimmed, and probably anything relevant should be moved into existing sections --&gt;

The UK's underground movement was focused on the [[Ladbroke Grove]]/[[Notting Hill]] area of London, which [[Mick Farren]] said "was an enclave of [[freak scene|freaks]], immigrants and [[bohemian]]s long before the [[hippie]]s got there". It had been depicted in [[Colin MacInnes]]' novel ''[[Absolute Beginners (novel)|Absolute Beginners]]'', about street culture at the time of the Notting Hill Riots in the 1950s.

The underground paper ''[[International Times]]'' (IT) began to appear in 1966 and Steve Abrams, founder of ''Soma'', summarised the underground as a "literary and artistic avant-garde with a large contingent from Oxford and Cambridge. [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John Hopkins]] (Hoppy), a member of the editorial board of ''International Times'' for example, was trained as a physicist at Cambridge."

Police harassment of members of the underground (often referred to as "freaks", initially by others as an insult, and later by themselves as an act of defiance) became commonplace, particularly against the [[underground press]]. According to Farren, "Police harassment, if anything, made the underground press stronger. It focused attention, stiffened resolve, and tended to confirm that what we were doing was considered dangerous to the establishment."

Key underground (community) bands of the time who often performed at benefit gigs for various worthy causes included [[Pink Floyd]] (when they still had [[Syd Barrett]]), [[Soft Machine]], [[Hawkwind]], [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] (featuring [[Mick Farren]]), and [[Pink Fairies]]; other key people included, in the late '60s, [[Marc Bolan]], who would leave "the Grove" to find fame with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], and his partner [[Steve Peregrin Took]], who remained in Ladbroke Grove and continued to perform benefit gigs in the anti-commercial ethos of the UK underground.

Within [[Portobello Road]] stood the Mountain Grill, a [[Cafe (British)|greasy spoon cafe]], which in the late 1960s and early 1970s was frequented by several UK underground artists, including [[Hawkwind]] and the Pink Fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110073047/https://www.timeout.com/london/music/counterculture-in-ladbroke-grove|title=Counterculture in Ladbroke Grove|author= Chris Parkin|date=13 Aug 2007|work=timeout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Hawkwind released an album titled ''Hall Of The Mountain Grill'' and [[Steve Peregrin Took]] wrote ''Ballad of the Mountain Grill'' (aka ''Flophouse Blues'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Steve-Took.co.uk Steve Took's Domain] Retrieved Aug. 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentators==
[[Mick Farren]] said, 

{{quote|My own feeling is that, not just sex, but anger and violence, are part and parcel of rock n' roll. The rock concert can work as an alternative for violence, an outlet for violence. But at that time there were a lot of things that made us really angry. We ''were'' outraged! In the U.S. the youth were sent to [[Vietnam]] and there was nothing we could do to change the way the government did it. [[Cannabis smoking|Smoking]] cannabis and doing things to get thrown in [[Prison|jail]] were our own way of expressing our anger, and we wanted change - I believed that picking up a [[guitar]], not a gun, would bring about change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/supermarketfiles/strangedays.htm Mick Farren - The Strange Days interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508000420/http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/supermarketfiles/strangedays.htm |date=2008-05-08 }} Retrieved 26 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It's like [[Germaine Greer]] said about the underground - it's not just some sort of scruffy club you can join, you're in or you're out... it's like being a criminal.&lt;ref name="thanatosoft"&gt;[http://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/undergroundfiles/interview.htm Mick Farren interview] Retrieved 26 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lifestyle==
The underground movement was also symbolised by the use of [[recreational drug use|drugs]]. The types of drugs used were varied and in many cases the names and effects were unknown as The Deviants/[[Pink Fairies]] member Russell Hunter, working at ''[[International Times]]'' (part of the [[underground press]] at the time), recalled. "People used to send in all kinds of strange drugs and things, pills and powders, stuff to smoke and that. They'd always give them to me to try to find out what they were! [Laughs]".

Part of the sense of humour of the underground, no doubt partly induced by the effects of both drugs and radical thinking was an enjoyment at "freakin' out the norms". [[Mick Farren]] recalls actions sure to elicit the required response. "The band's baroque House of Usher apartment on London's Shaftesbury Avenue had witnessed pre-Raphaelite hippy scenes, like Sandy the bass player (of The Deviants and [[Pink Fairies]]), Tony the now and again keyboard player, and a young [[David Bowie]], fresh from Beckenham Arts Lab, sunbathing on the roof, taking photos of each other and posing coyly as sodomites".

==Aesthetics==
The image of the underground as manifested in magazines such as ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and newspapers like ''International Times'' was dominated by key talented graphic artists, particularly [[Martin Sharp]] and the Nigel Waymouth–Michael English team, [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]], who fused [[Alfons Mucha]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] arabesques with the higher colour key of psychedelia.

==The overground==
There was a smaller, less widely spread manifestation from the UK underground termed the "Overground", which referred to an explicitly spiritual, cosmic, quasi-religious intent, though this was an element that had always been present. At least two magazines—''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'' (6 issues, 1968&amp;ndash;72) and ''[[Vishtaroon]]''—adopted this "overground" style. ''Gandalf's Garden'' was also a shop/restaurant/meeting place at [[World's End, Chelsea]]. The magazines were printed on pastel paper using multi-coloured inks and contained articles about meditation, [[vegetarian]]ism, [[mandala]]s, [[ethic]]s, [[poet]]ry, [[pacifism]] and other subjects at a distance from the more wild and militant aspects of the underground. The first issue of ''Gandalf's Garden'' urged that we should "seek to stimulate our own inner gardens if we are to save our Earth and ourselves from engulfment." It was edited by Muz Murray who is now called Ramana Baba and teaches yoga.

These attitudes were embodied musically in [[The Incredible String Band]], who in 2003 were described as "holy" by the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], in a foreword for the book ''Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium'' ([[Helter Skelter Books]]). He had previously chosen the band's track "The Hedgehog's Song" as his only piece of popular music on the radio programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''). The critic [[Ian MacDonald]] said: "Much that appeared to be profane in Sixties [[youth culture]] was quite the opposite".

'''Vaso Čubrilović''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Васо Чубриловић}}; 14 January 1897&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 1990) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] scholar and Yugoslav politician. As a teenager, he joined the South Slav student movement known as [[Young Bosnia]] and was involved in the conspiracy to [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinate]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914. His brother, [[Veljko Čubrilović|Veljko]], was also involved in the plot. Čubrilović was convicted of treason by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and given a sixteen-year sentence; his brother was sentenced to death and executed. Čubrilović was released from prison at war's end and studied history at the universities of [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]] and [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]]. In 1937, he delivered a lecture to the Serbian Cultural Club in which he advocated [[The Expulsion of the Albanians]] from Yugoslavia. Two years later, he became a history professor at the [[University of Belgrade]]. Following the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, Čubrilović was arrested by the Germans and sent to the [[Banjica concentration camp]], where he remained imprisoned for much of the war.

As World War II drew to a close, Čubrilović urged the Yugoslav authorities to expel ethnic minorities (particularly Germans and Hungarians) from the country. At war's end, he became a government minister. In his position as Minister of Agriculture, he pushed for the implementation of agricultural reforms. In his later years, he distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth and expressed regret over Franz Ferdinand's assassination. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill the Archduke.

==Early life==
Vaso Čubrilović was born in [[Gradiška, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradiška]] on 14 January 1897.{{sfn|Elsie|2010|p=69}} His was a well known family from the region of [[Bosanska Krajina]]. He was a relative of [[Vaso Vidović]], a leader of the 1875–77 [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|Herzegovina Uprising]] who attended the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=304}} Čubrilović finished primary school in his hometown.{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=3}} He went on to attend the Tuzla High School but was expelled for refusing to stand during the Austro-Hungarian national anthem. He subsequently enrolled in the sixth class of the Sarajevo High School.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=304}}

==Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and World War I==
[[File:Vaso Čubrilović.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Čubrilović in Austro-Hungarian police custody, October 1914.]]
Čubrilović had been a member of [[Young Bosnia]] prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Elsie|2010|p=69}} He and his older brother were involved in the conspiracy to [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinate]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] on 28 June 1914. The younger Čubrilović was the youngest of the conspirators.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=314}} He was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in [[Bosanska Dubica]] on 3 July.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=332–333}} The main conspirators were tried in a military prison in Sarajevo. The state attorney charged twenty-two of the accused with high treason and first-degree murder and three with complicity to commit murder. The trial began on 12 October and lasted until 23 October. Čubrilović was only 17 years and six months old at the time.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=336}} The Čubrilović brothers, [[Ivo Kranjčević]] and [[Neđo Kerović]] were defended by the lawyer Rudolf Cistler.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=336}} At the trial, Čubrilović stated that the mistreatment of South Slavs by the Habsburgs motived him to take part in the plot.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=338}} "I can state that the monarchy is ruled by the Germans and the Magyars while the Slavs are oppressed," he said.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=338}} Asked if he identified as a Serb or a Croat, Čubrilović declared himself a Serbo-Croat. "It means I don't consider myself solely a Serb," he explained, "but that I must work for Croatia as well as for Serbia."{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=90}} Though the trial ended on 23 October, sentencing did not occur until five days later. Čubrilović was convicted of treason and given a sixteen-year sentence.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=346}} He had initially been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. When asked his religious beliefs, he identified as an [[Atheism|atheist]], prompting the judges to add another three years.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=212}} A further three were added after he refused to express remorse for the Archduke's death and blamed Austria-Hungary for starting the war.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=341}} His brother Veljko was sentenced to death and hanged.{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=55}}

Čubrilović was initially sent to serve out his sentence in [[Zenica]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=351}} On 2 March, he and some of his co-conspirators were relocated to the Möllersdorf military prison, near [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=353}} They were re-tried in [[Travnik]] on 14 June 1915, and had several years added to their sentences.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=347}} Čubrilović was subsequently moved back to Möllersdorf. On 13 September 1917, the authorities decided to move almost all the surviving conspirators to Zenica prison. He remained imprisoned in Zenica until the end of the war.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=361}}

==Interwar period==
Čubrilović completed his high school education in Sarajevo in 1919. First, he enrolled at the [[University of Zagreb]] to study history, but later transferred to the [[University of Belgrade]], where he received a [[Bachelor's degree]] in history in 1922. In 1929, he obtained his [[Ph.D]] at the University of Belgrade with a thesis titled "The Bosnian Uprising 1875–1878". In the meantime, he had worked as a history teacher at high schools in [[Sremska Mitrovica]], Sarajevo and Belgrade. The historian [[Vladimir Ćorović]] subsequently selected Čubrilović as his personal assistant. In 1934, Čubrilović became a [[docent]] at the university. From 1921 to 1939, he was an active member of the [[Agrarian Party (Yugoslavia)|Agrarian Party]].{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=3}}

In 1937, Čubrilović delivered a lecture to the [[Serbian Cultural Club]] in which he outlined possible methods the Yugoslav government could use to coerce [[Albanians]] into leaving Kosovo. Čubrilović argued that the only way to "deal" with the Albanians was to use the "brute force of an organized state". "If we do not settle accounts with them," he opined, "in 20–30 years we shall have to cope with a terrible irredentism."{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=149}} He was highly critical of government attempts to [[Colonisation of Kosovo|colonize]] parts of Kosovo as he felt they were ineffective.{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=23}}{{efn|Between 1918 and 1945, about 45,000 Albanians left Kosovo, mostly to Turkey. They were replaced by 60,000 Serb settlers in the [[interwar period]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=100}} Tens of thousands of these settlers were expelled by the Albanians during [[World War II]] and were not allowed to return to Kosovo by Tito's post-war government.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=150}}}} Čubrilović also criticized the government for not having seized the opportunity presented by a 1918–21 revolt among Kosovo Albanians to force them out of the region. He stated that the benefits of the forced expulsion of Albanians outweighed any risk since "a threat to Yugoslav security would be removed". He reasoned: "At a time when Germany can expel tens of thousands of Jews and Russia can shift millions of people from one part of the continent to another, the shifting of a few Albanians will not lead to the outbreak of a world war."{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=23}} The content of the lecture was preserved in writing, came into the possession of Yugoslavia's military intelligence service and was preserved at the Military Archive in Belgrade.{{sfn|Bjelajac|2007|p=223}} It was not made public until 1988.{{sfn|Anžulović|1999|loc=p. 199, note 66}} In the ensuing decades, Albanian historians have referred to it as evidence of a plot to evict Kosovo's Albanian population, usually claiming it was written at the request of the Yugoslav General Staff. However, there is no evidence to this effect.{{sfn|Bjelajac|2007|p=223}} Professor [[Sabrina P. Ramet]] doubts the lecture had much influence on the Yugoslav authorities, who were already long committed to seeing Kosovo Albanians leave the province and emigrate to Turkey.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=100}}

==World War II and later life==
In 1939, Čubrilović became a professor at the University of Belgrade.{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=3}} In April 1941, the [[Axis powers]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]], and Čubrilović was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in the coastal town of [[Risan]].{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=4}} From there, he was transferred to Belgrade and imprisoned at the [[Banjica concentration camp]], where he remained for much of the war.{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=4}}{{sfn|Nešović|1981|p=728}} Once German forces had been forced out of Serbia, Čubrilović became an advisor to Yugoslavia's new [[Communism|communist]] leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]].{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=63}} The anti-Serb pogroms of World War II, particularly those orchestrated by the Albanians, again directed Čubrilović's attention to the status of Yugoslavia's national minorities.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=150}} On 17 November 1944, in Belgrade, Čubrilović presented a memorandum titled "The Minority Problem in the New Yugoslavia" ({{lang-sh-Latn|Manjinski problem u novoj Jugoslaviji}}) to the communist authorities.{{sfn|Elsie|2010|p=69}} In it, he advised Tito's government to expel all of Yugoslavia's Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Romanians and Albanians. Indeed, virtually all ethnic Germans living in the country were forced out, as were many Hungarians and Romanians. "The minority problem," Čubrilović wrote, "if we don't solve it now, will never be solved."{{sfn|Judah|2002|pp=31–32}} At the time, such suggestions did not come across as particularly radical given that they coincided with the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|mass expulsion of Germans]] from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=150}}

In early 1945, Čubrilović was appointed Minister of Agriculture in Tito's government.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=311}} In August of that year, he pushed for the implementation of the Law on State Agricultural Farms, which emphasized the need to undertake economic measures that would rebuild and strengthen Yugoslavia's agricultural sector.{{sfn|Bokovoy|1998|pp=45, 61}} Čubrilović was later appointed Minister of Forestry.&lt;ref name="UBL"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Banja Luka]]|title=Academician Prof. Dr. Vaso Čubrilović|url=http://www.unibl.rs/en/page/Academician-Prof-Dr-Vaso-Subrilovic/5|access-date=2015-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011018/http://www.unibl.rs/en/page/Academician-Prof-Dr-Vaso-Subrilovic/5|archive-date=2015-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he became a correspondent of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU), and in 1961, he was granted full membership. Čubrilović was also a correspondent of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav]] and [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] academies of sciences and arts, and a regular member of the [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. In 1976, he became an honorary member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Matica Srpska|1997|p=4}} In his later years, Čubrilović distanced himself from the Pan Slav, and later nationalist, ideologies of his youth.{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=63}} Referring to Franz Ferdinand's assassination, he said: "We destroyed a beautiful world that was lost forever due to the war that followed."{{sfn|Sugar|1999|p=70}} In 1986, he expressed public disapproval of the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU memorandum]], which argued that Yugoslavia's Serbs were being discriminated against and called for a fundamental reorganization of the state.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|loc=p. 191, note 4}} In 1987, the [[Presidium of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Presidency]] awarded Čubrilović the [[Order of the Yugoslav Star]].{{sfn|Gaber|Kuzmanić|1989|p=51}} He died in Belgrade on 11 June 1990, aged 93.{{sfn|Elsie|2010|p=69}} At the time of his death, he was the last surviving participant in the conspiracy to kill Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Sugar|1999|p=70}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5748">'''William O'Connor Morris''' (26 November 1824, [[Kilkenny]] – 3 August 1904) was an Irish county court judge and historian.&lt;ref name=DNB12&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Morris, William O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;{{cite journal|title=Morris, His Honour Judge William O'Connor|journal=Who's Who|year=1904|page= 1095|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014517331;view=1up;seq=1119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Morris was educated at [[Epsom College]] in Surrey and a school at [[Laugharne]] in Wales, before matriculating in 1843 at [[Oriel College, Oxford]]. He graduated there in 1848 after a leave of absence of a year and a half in 1846–1847 due to his family's financial difficulties connected with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. Three years after leaving Oxford, he entered the [[King's Inns]] in Dublin as a law student. He was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1852 and was [[Call to the bar|called to the Irish bar]] in 1854. He became a professor of common and criminal law in the King's Inns in 1862. In 1863 he was appointed Special Commissioner of Irish Fisheries but was compelled to resign due to a differing opinion with [[Sir Robert Peel]].&lt;ref name=DNB12/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt;

Morris married in 1858 and through his wife's inheritance became owner of the Gartnamona estate.&lt;ref name=DNB12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartnamona House|website=Mapcarta|url=http://mapcarta.com/18273958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, an acquaintance of [[Henry Reeve (journalist)|Henry Reeve]], contributed articles on history and other subjects to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' and, less often, to the ''[[English Historical Review]]''. He also reviewed books on military history for ''[[The Times]]''. As a landlord he was keenly interested in land tenure in Ireland, and the [[Irish Land Acts|Land Act of 1870]] incorporated many of his ideas. He was appointed a county court judge for [[County Louth]] in 1872 and after six years was transferred to [[County Kerry]]. At his own request he was transferred in 1886 to the county judgeship of the united counties of [[County Sligo|Sligo]] and [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]] and thereafter devoted most of his efforts to literary work.&lt;ref name=DNB12/&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Georgiana Kathleen Lindsay on 16 March 1858;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgiana Kathleen Lindsay|website=thepeerage.com|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2090.htm#i20899}}&lt;/ref&gt; the marriage produced five daughters and one son.&lt;ref name=DNB12/&gt;

Elpeleg was born in 1926 in Baranow, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] to his parents Rivka (née Zayfntreger) and Yosef Elphlang. His father was a carpenter and his mother a house wife. Elpeleg was the second of four siblings: Hadasa (1924), David (1928) and Yerachmiel (1929). In 1934 the family came to Israel and settled in the Makabi-Tzrifim neighbourhood in Jaffa. Following David Ben-Gurion instruction that officers should change their family name to a Hebrew one, Elpeleg changed his name from Elphlang to Elpeleg.
In the mid-1950s Elpeleg was the military governor of [[Triangle (Israel)|the Triangle]] and from 1956 to 1957 the military governor of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Bitterlemons&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediamonitors.net/zvielpeleg1.html |title=Respect their philosophy of survival (end note bio) |first=Zvi |last=Elpeleg |publisher=Bitterlemons.org / Media monitors
