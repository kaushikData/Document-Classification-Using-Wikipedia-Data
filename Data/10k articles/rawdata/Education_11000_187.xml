The program is divided into two branches: the Writing Program (with several advanced tiers for mentorship-driven workshops) and the Executive Program, which trains students in the development and production side of the business. Both programs typically take place side-by-side in the summer.

Act One is located on Beachwood Drive in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].

== History ==
[[File:ACT1Class_Summer_2009.jpg|thumb|Summer 2009 Act One students]]
Act One was formed in January 1999 as an educational outreach to writers of the Christian entertainment fellowship Inter-Mission; initial funding was provided by the [[Stratford Foundation]]. A core group of Hollywood professionals came together with Act One's first class in hopes of passing on their experience. According to their promotional material, Act One's goal is not to produce explicitly religious entertainment, but movie and TV projects that respect and serve the global audience.

Act One was first stationed at Hollywood Presbyterian Church before relocating to their current location on Beachwood Drive.

== Academics ==
=== Writing Program for Screen and Television===
The Writing Program was created the same year as Act One, and until 2009 was an intensive one-month course devoted to teaching the rigors of screenwriting; a [[TV track]] was added in 2002, allowing a select group of writing students to participate in a mockup of a real TV writer's room. [[File:WritingMeeting_Batali.jpg|thumb|Faculty Instructor Dean Batali making a point at a writer's meeting, July 2009]]

=== Producing and Entertainment Executive Program ===
The 14-month Certificate Program provides students a strong foundation in producing for mainstream screen and television, and prepares them for entry-level careers in the entertainment industry, which focus on becoming a producer or entertainment executive. Students in the 14-month Certificate Program get a broad overview of all aspects of the business of Hollywood, along with specialized instruction in creative development, physical production, and marketing and distribution. The 14-Month Certificate Program kicks-off with the two-week Producinhg Seminar, then an eight-week internship at a studio or production company along with a Producing Workshop.  Concentration in specialized areas of producing come next, and The Producer’s Spiritual Journey runs concurrently and rounds out the program.

The first was '''''Americans at Work''''', a 30-minute show heard on in the late evening on Thursdays, Saturdays and Tuesdays beginning April 28, 1938. By 1939, it was a successful component of the Thursday night CBS schedule with Brewster Morgan directing. The unscripted show used an interview format to cover diverse occupations, from working class individuals to such famed figures as [[Walt Disney]]. Many episodes were unscripted. It continued until April 23, 1940.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt;

'''''Living History''''', first broadcast May 4, 1938, was scheduled on Tuesday evenings. This 15-minute historical drama returned four years later for a run in the spring and summer of 1942 from March 3 until June 30.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt;

Hosted by historian [[Allan Nevins]], the 15-minute '''''Adventures in Science''''' covered a wide variety of medical and scientific topics. It was broadcast on several different days of the week from March 17, 1938, until August 18, 1957.&lt;ref name=dunning/&gt;

'''All Bengal Teachers Association''', a movement of teachers (excluding the Teachers and non-Teaching staff of schools under direct control of Government of West Bengal) in the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. ABTA is one, although not the only, teachers and non-teaching staff's wing which is predominantly  run by teachers or non-teaching staff of the Government Sponsored/aided schools who are either members or supporters of [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], though it is not directly affiliated to CPI(M). There are many members of this organization who are not in the same political league as CPI(M), still they become member because it is by far the largest Teacher's Body of West Bengal. Though not many, but some of the members of ABTA are from Privately managed schools also. ABTA is by far the largest teachers organization in the state.It was established in 1921. Acharya Prfulla Chandra Roy was the president of the Association at the initial stage. Present Secretary of A.B.T.A. is Utpal Roy (as of June 2012). Number of members in the government and govt-aided schools of West Bengal are not less than 1,40,000.This amounts to 70 per cent of the total teachers of the state(i.e.west Bengal)

'''Fredrik Ludvig Andreas Vibe Aubert''' (28 January 1851&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1913) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] art educator, [[art historian]] and art critic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/2/0380.html ''Aubert, Fredrik Ludvig Andreas Vibe'' (Project Runeberg: Salmonsens konversationsleksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Andreas Aubert was the son of  [[Ludvig Cæsar Martin Aubert]] (1807-1877) who was a classical scholar and professor of philology at the [[University of Oslo]].
His elder brother [[Ludvig Mariboe Benjamin Aubert]] (1838-1896) was a jurist and professor. His sister-in-law was novelist [[Elise Aubert]] (1837- 1909). He was married to Martha Johanne Védastine Moe (1855–1933), becoming the son-in-law of Bishop [[Jørgen Moe]] (1813-1882) and brother-in-law of writer [[Moltke Moe]] (1859-1913).

Andreas Aubert  was a student at [[Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry]] (1869–71), before he began to study theology. He studied theology  [[cand.theol.]] (1877) and then worked as a teacher at Aars og Voss' skole (1878–1895). He was also employed as an art critic at ''[[Morgenbladet]]'', ''[[Aftenposten]]'' and   ''[[Dagbladet]]''.
Andreas Aubert wrote extensively about Norwegian artist, [[Johan Christian Dahl]] starting with an autobiography titled ''Professor Dahl. Et stykke af Aarhundredets Kunst- og Kulturhistorie'' in 1893. As an art historian, his major works were the fundamental studies of the art of  [[Johan Christian Dahl]] which won him an annual government scholarship in 1895 and ended his teaching career. He became a professional art historian, critic and researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Andreas_Aubert|title= Andreas Aubert|publisher =Norsk biografisk leksikon 
|author=Nils Messel|accessdate= April  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aubert also championed [[Edvard Munch]],  [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Max Klinger]], [[Gabriel von Max]], and [[Vilhelm Hammershøi]]. He described them as "[[neurasthenic]]s", by which he meant that their art was oriented toward the psychological. He had an important role in restoring the legacy of the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], now considered the leading artist of that period, toward the end of the 19th century.

The '''Bachelor of Science Degree in Paramedicine''' is a four-year academic degree in the science and principles of [[paramedicine]], granted by a [[tertiary education]] university or similarly accredited school. Though one is eligible to sit for the US National Registry examination, administered by the [[National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]] (NREMT), to become a Registered [[Paramedic]] after graduating from either a two-year program with an associate degree (A.A.S.; ADP) or from a highly concentrated certificate program, the '''BSP''' degree prepares Paramedics for roles as EMS leaders, system directors, and community/industrial health and safety positions. Paramedics with a BSP are recognized to excel as teachers, researchers, and clinicians. While the BSP alone serves to well prepare the healthcare provider, it also serves as a phenomenal base for further medical training such as Medical School (MD,DO) or Physician Assistant (PA) programs.

The '''Bourse du Travail''' (French for "labour exchanges"), a French form of the [[labour council]], were working class organizations that encouraged [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]], education, and [[self-organization]] amongst their members in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Role==

===Labour===
Early [[French Third Republic|Third Republic France]] was a time of dramatic social and economic change. With the tremendous growth of industrial capitalism in the last twenty years of the 19th century and the continued migration of workers to cities, the traditional system of meeting places for those seeking work was overtaxed.  Skilled  and unskilled trades alike had gradually developed systems to match those seeking work with employers, but the legalisation of trades unions in 1884, helped formalise these structures.  Employers, too, were creating private labour placement offices.&lt;ref&gt;Casey Harison. The Rise And Decline Of A Revolutionary Space: Paris' Place De Greve And The Stonemasons Of Creuse, 1750-1900 - Critical Essay in the Journal of Social History: Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican government of [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]] relied upon the support of working class voters, and so helped create the first Bourses du Travail under the control of newly legalised labour unions. Socialists and radicals, elected to city offices in some areas, made the funding of Bourses du Travail a priority. As the system expanded, radicals in local government extended aid. The ''loi du 14 mars 1904'' mandated that every city of over ten thousand inhabitants had to create a ''bureau de placement'', establishing job offices and undercutting employer run placement agencies.  These government offices were usually placed in the local Bourses du Travail.&lt;ref&gt;David Rappe,''La Bourse du travail de Lyon'', Lyon, Atelier de création libertaire, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With government support came government regulation. While there was no legal obligation for the state or the municipality to put in place these buildings, their construction helped both the [[workers' movement]] and [[surveillance]] of its activities. Business interests and the police saw the formalisation of Bourses du Travail as a way to channel the labour movement away from revolutionary change or to keep an eye on those who promoted it.

===Role in revolutionary ideology===
{{Libertarian socialism}}
The ideology behind the explosion in Bourses du Travail, popularized by revolutionary syndicalists like [[Fernand Pelloutier]], intended to create  in them the key organizational component of radical economic transformation.  By acting as future co-ordinating bodies, facilitating communication between ''syndicates'' (unions), the Bourse du Travail would co-ordinate production and consumption in the absence of both the state and the private ownership of the means of production. These institutions were central to the notion of [[Syndicalism|Revolutionary Syndicalism]] which dominated the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]], France's largest labor federation in the first twenty years on the 20th century. Pelloutier and other revolutionary syndicalists argued that the Bourses—small scale, local, self made—were the guarantee that the CGT would remain both directly democratic and revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelloutier.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=193&amp;idparent=190 David Berry. Anarchism, Syndicalism and the Bolshevik Challenge in France, 1918-1926 Part III : Syndicalism and the anarchist diaspora. 2006 on pelloutier.net]&lt;/ref&gt;  They saw labor organizations as interconnecting in three ways: a national federation uniting each specific union (traditional craft or trade unions); a national federation of ''all'' unions (in this case, the CGT); and all local workers, across union and political boundaries, united in the Bourse du travail.  Supporters of the Bourse movement believed this structure last should become the most important form of workers'  association.&lt;ref&gt;For close examination of these tensions see:
*Kenneth H. Tucker.  French Revolutionary Syndicalism and the Public Sphere. Cambridge University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-521-56359-3}} For both the history of these tensions and theoretical examination.
*Kathryn E. Amdur.  Syndicalist Legacy. University of Illinois (1986) {{ISBN|0-252-01238-0}} for how the federation of unions and the federation of single trades in fact triumphed in two towns in the period after WWI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===
The other major change of this period was the Republican promulgation of [[Laic laws]], taking education out of the hands of the [[Catholic church]], and eventually taxing and regulating Church institutions. Bourses du Travail, like civil marriage or lay funerals, filled a communal role once played by local parishes.&lt;ref&gt;See also on Wikipedia: [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State]], [[Laïcité#France]], and [[Anti-clericalism#France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourses du Travail were centres of [[working class culture]].  Almost every one contained lending libraries, classrooms, meeting halls, and theatres.  Family and community celebrations took place here (away from the church), as did classes and political discussions, formal meetings and light entertainment.  The Bourses du Travail buildings are still often the locations of theatres and concert venues.

==History==

===Birth in the Third Republic===
[[File:La Bourse du Travail par (...)Ducoux François-Joseph btv1b53014361z.jpg|thumb|''La Bourse du Travail'' Ducoux (1851)]]
The idea of French labour exchanges far predates the institution.  In 1790, at the height of the [[French Revolution]], an abortive Bourse du Travail was established in Paris. The [[loi Le Chapelier]] of 1791 outlawed this and any other labour organisation, and despite the brief legalisation during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], unions remained illegal until 1884. Adolphe Leullier presented in 1845 a similar project which he called the  ''Bureau central des ouvriers''.

The idea of creating a Labour Exchange (''Bourse du travail'') is credited to the economist [[Gustave de Molinari]] in 1845.
In February 1851 [[François Joseph Ducoux]] submitted a bill to the Legislative Assembly that proposed to establish a state-run Labour Exchange in Paris.
His project was also submitted to the Paris Municipal Commission.
The project was abandoned, but later revived in 1875 and 1883 and eventually came into force in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |language=fr |ref={{harvid|Notice bibliographique : La Bourse du Travail ... BnF}}
 |title=Notice bibliographique : La Bourse du Travail |publisher=BnF: Bibliotheque nationale de France |url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb41520017m |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, workers petitioned the Paris municipal council to establish a Bourse du Travail, which was rejected. Labour organisations had existed underground or by other names, but their new status led to an explosion of radical activity. The French Revolutionary tradition was evolving into the economic sphere of union organising, rather than the seizure of power (exemplified by [[Auguste Blanqui]]).

The first Bourse du Travail, in Paris, was begun in 1887. A building on [[rue JJ Rousseau]] was donated by the Socialist municipal council, and a second on [[rue du Château d’eau]] was created in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Both survive and operate as union and community centers today. See:

===''Fédération des Bourses de travail'' and the CGT===
''See also [[:fr:Confédération générale du travail|fr:Confédération générale du travail]], [[:fr:Charte d'Amiens|fr:Charter of Amiens]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism]]''

The ''Fédération des Bourses de travail'' (Federation of Labour Exchanges) was created in 1892 at the Congress of [[Saint-Etienne]] by [[Fernand Pelloutier]] to [[federate]] each city's workers' organisations. It was first led by [[Bernard Resset]] (1892), then [[Rieu Cordier]], then Fernand Pelloutier (1895) and from 1901 to 1918 by [[Georges Yvetot]].

The Federation of Labour Exchanges merged in 1895 with the [[Fédération nationale des syndicats]] (National Federation of Trade-Unions), which had been created in 1886, giving rise to the [[Confédération générale du travail]] (CGT), which was dominated by a [[Syndicalism|revolutionary syndicalist strategy]] until 1921.

It was the FBT that, as much as any organization, created the CGT.  At their [[Nice]] congress in 1901 the fédération des Bourses du Travail formally proposed the creation of and fusion with the CGT which took place in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forez-info.com/encyclopedie/memoire_et_patrimoine/la_bourse_du_travail_de_saint-etienne.html La Bourse du travail de Saint-Etienne on forez-info.com.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the leaders of the Bourse du Travail went on to lead the CGT, and the FBT was a co-equal partner with individual unions in the CGTs founding.  Bourses have thus been called the ''mère des syndicat'' (the mother of unions) for their role.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Yves Martin.  Aux origines de la Bourse du Travail de St-Nazaire de 1892 à la fin du siècle, in Cahier de l'AREMORS n°3 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Structurally, individual Bourses comprised the ''building'' itself (and its social, education, and other practical resources), and the Bourse as a council of local unions.  Unions paid a fee to join the bourse, though CGT affiliated unions were often exempted, and sent representatives to regular meetings of all the local unions. The administration of the bourse was by elected representatives.  Contrary to Pelloutier's vision, these representatives came from a variety of ideological backgrounds which both represented the local political leanings of unions, but also the wider political left in the area.  In many towns there were socialist municipal councils and mayors, either in [[Jules Guesde]]'s [[French Workers' Party]], the [[Jean Jaurès|Jauresin]] [[Possibilism (French Socialist)|possibilists]] of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), or independent reformers of the [[Aristide Briand|Briand group]].  This leaves aside the constellation of syndicalist focused socialists (like [[Jean Allemane]]'s [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (France)|Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party]]), cooperativists, and [[individualist anarchist]] workers who sometimes played active roles in their local Bourse.  In most places [[anarcho-syndicalism]] was but one small faction in both the bourses ''and'' the CGT, and so the bourses took on roles of a [[reformist]], or [[Marxist]], or strictly trade unionist character which presaged the CGT split.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn E. Amdur, is especially good on teasing out the complexity and variation of this. See especially all of Chapter 2, pp57-64, pp. 126-133, and 196-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the PCF and decline of the Bourse===
The birth of the [[French Communist Party]] began the decline of the Bourse du Travail movement. The CGT, which had regrouped the individual organisations, was swept up in the ideological tumult of the post war years.  It became, like much of the French left, dominated by the Communists ideological vision, which saw the loose federalism of Revolutionary Syndicalism as a reason for the failure of the 1918-1919 strike wave. In 1921, the CGT revised its structure, eliminating the local Bourses du Travail as constituent organisation of the Union, and replacing them with a network of ''Unions Locales''. From here on, the CGT followed a British and American model of local trade specific unions, federated into a single national structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelloutier.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=193&amp;idparent=190 David Berry. Anarchism, Syndicalism and the Bolshevik Challenge in France, 1918-1926 Part III : Syndicalism and the anarchist diaspora. 2006 on pelloutier.net]
And for the United States echo of this process, see William E. Forbath. Not So Simple - labor politics of Sam Gompers in Labor History: May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A split, eventually into three federations, created a [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO)-dominated CGT, the [[United General Confederation of Labour]] (Confédération générale du travail - unitaire or CGTU), where communists cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists, and the [[Revolutionary Trade Unionist General Confederation of Labour]] (Confédération générale du travail - syndicaliste révolutionnaire or CGTSR) in 1923 when the communists gained control of the CGTU. (The CGT and CGTU reunited in 1936, and remained close to the [[French Communist Party]].)  Predictably, these often bitter party divisions in the labor movement made the local and inclusive vision of the Bourses impossible.

The Bourses du Travail survived, often as a single organisation union hall, while the history of splits in the French labour movement saw the buildings pass from one hand to another, revert to municipalities, or disappear entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [http://www.ul-fo-lille.com/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=30 The Bourse in Lille], for example passed to the [[Force Ouvrière|Force Ouvriere union]], while  [http://www.bourse-troyes.ouvaton.org/ the Troyes Bourse was abandoned].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

===Buildings and communities===
Bourse du Travail buildings and institutions remain in most large French cities.  Many are headquarters of the local unions which are federated into the [[Confédération nationale du travail]], or of other unions which split from the [[French Communist Party]].   Many bourse were central as places of organizing and resistance during [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]. In some places municipal governments have retained ownership, or community and radical groups have taken them over.  Some have simply been sold off for office space or torn down.

In Lille, one of the earliest bourses remains as the home of five unions and a radical community center, and came center stage in the resistance to the deportation of [[undocumented immigrants]], when 460 ''sans-papiers'' staged a 30-day hunger strike to oppose government policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Bourse du travail de Lille|French Wikipedia:Bourse du Travail de Lille]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===
The Bourse du Travail concept has been central to [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalists]] across the globe, and the model greatly influenced [[Council communism]] and other forms of [[left communism]].  Anarchists  of many stripes point to the Bourse du Travail as an example of a directly democratic, small scale federalist institutional structure.

==Outside France==
The Bourse du Travail idea was exported along with [[French colonial empires|French imperialism]].  The FBT's full name was actually ''Fédération des Bourses du Travail de France et des Colonies'', though in practice  this meant there were sections in the French [[Pied-noir|settler]] dominated parts of [[Algeria]].  These declined with their French counterparts, and did not survive the [[Algerian War|anticolonial struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ayache. Essai sur la vie syndicale en Algerie, l'annee du Centenaire (1930) in [[Le Mouvement social]], No. 78, Special Issue: Le Mouvement Ouvrier Francais et l'Afrique du Nord. (Jan. - Mar., 1972), pp. 95-114&lt;/ref&gt;

In Subsaharan Africa, Bourses du Travail were implanted in two ways.  In French controlled regions, labor unions were organized by the CGT in the 1930s and 1940s.  Their labour halls were styled Bourses du travail, some of which remain as centers of union activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/200.html  Guy Bertrans Wonkam La grève au Labogenie préoccupe la Cstc in Le Quotidien Mutations (Yaoundé), 16 December 2003], for current bourses in the [[Republic of Cameroon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of [[Belgian Congo]] created a Bourse du travail at [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] in 1910 as a state controlled hiring hall, in an attempt to lure labor to areas of planned industrial (mostly mining) concentration.  Attempts by local officials to recast this cynically created employment agency into a more worker run operation suggest that the idea of a Bourse du travail never lost its syndicalist connotations.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When Buttgenbach, managing director of the UMHK, proposed the creation of the BTK to the colonial minister Renkin, the minister promptly called an assembly of the major employers in Katanga, resulting in the creation, as a private enterprise, of the Bourse in July 1910. However, the administration's views on the functioning of the institution were inconsistent with the view of the BTK as a monopolistic, state-run and coercive labour bureau."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Carmine Benincasa''' (born 17 December 1947 in [[Eboli]]) is an Italian art critic and [[Art History|art historian]] professor.

== Biography ==
'''Carmine Benincasa''' was born in [[Eboli]] in the south of Italy. After studying in a religious school he moved to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

He was a professor of art history at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata]], the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Florence]] and Professor of History of Art at the [[Faculty of Architecture]] of the [[University La Sapienza]] in Rome. During this period he met intellectuals like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0357919&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Bruno Zevi]] and many more.

From 1978 to 1982 he was a member of the [[Venice Biennale]] Visual Arts Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/10/16/biennale-il-psi-fa-incetta-di-poltrone.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Environment. In 1994 he was briefly accused and incarcerated for defrauding collectors by validating and selling false artworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/07/08/critico-arte-professore-in-cella-per.html&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Benincasa was eventually cleared of every wrongdoing by the [[Supreme Court of Italy]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id%3D239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000431/http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id=239 |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benincasa has published numerous essays, articles and monographs on artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Mario Ceroli]], [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Joan Mirò]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]]. He has also organized many international exhibitions, including a section of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982.

Benincasa is currently chief editor of the Italian edition of ''[[Cahiers d'Art]]''.

'''Continuous assessment''' is a form of educational examination that evaluates a student's progress throughout a prescribed course. It is often used as an alternative to the final [[Test (assessment)|examination]] system.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}} Proponents of continuous assessment argue that the approach allows tracking of progress and has a chance of offering students more support, guidance, and opportunities to improve during the course or programme.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}

== Characteristics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
* Comprehensive
* Cumulative
* Diagnostic
* Formative
* Guidance-oriented
* Systematic in nature

== Advantages ==

Continuous assessment can help students learn in the following ways:
# Continuous assessment can provide early indications of the performance of students.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}
# '''An increased sense of inclusiveness:''' Continuous assessment provides students with a constant stream of opportunities to prove their mastery of material and sends the message that everyone can succeed if given enough time and practice. This reduces the anxiety around testing and heightens the emphasis on the learning itself.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}
# '''Higher learning standards for all:''' In a system of continuous assessment, advanced students can progress through material at their own pace and remain engaged by pursuing more challenging work as they master the basics.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}

==Disadvantages==

# ''' Greater study pressure:''' Unlike the final exam system, students and teachers need to focus throughout a course or programme, as all work counts towards the final grade. This may cause learners to feel more stressed. Under the final exam system, students may "cram", or study for long hours, before the test in order to get a good grade. Thus, they only have to work hard for a shorter period.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}
# ''' Risk of plagiarism:''' As homework and assignments become more important, students may not feel secure just showing their own knowledge. Instead, they may plagiarize other's work in order to secure a better score{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}

== Formative assessment ==

Continuous assessment will often include some form of formative assessment. The formative assessment covers the range of informal diagnostic tests a teacher can use to assist the process of learning by their students. This may include activities such as weekly pop quizzes or preparatory assignments. Prescriptive but ungraded feedback enables students to reflect on what they are learning and why. The goal is to improve performance and achieve successful outcomes. Robert Stake, Director of the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation, likens formative assessment to a cook tasting a soup before serving it to a guest. Despite its advantages, formative assessment can be time-consuming, and incentives in education systems tend to favor more objective assessments.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}

An advantage of formative assessment for learning is that it is ongoing. This allows for incremental feedback to identify problems at their earliest stages. For example, a student can correct conceptual errors before undertaking work on a term paper. As a student works on a topic, input from the teacher can inform, guide, and validate each step of the process. Cheating and plagiarism remain significant problems in academic settings. Compared to graded summative assessments like final exams, ungraded formative assessments reduce the temptation to cheat. This allows students to focus on learning instead of grades.{{citation_needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23688">{{distinguish|Dark Enlightenment}}The '''Counter-Enlightenment''' was a term that some 20th-century commentators have used to describe multiple strains of thought that arose in the late-18th and early-19th centuries in opposition to the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. 

Though the first known use of the term in English was in 1949 and there were several uses of it,&lt;ref&gt;Listed by Henry Hardy in the second edition of Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. xxv, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; including one by [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Counter-Enlightenment is usually associated with [[Isaiah Berlin]], who is often credited for re-inventing it. The starting point of discussion on this concept in English started with Isaiah Berlin's 1973 Essay, ''The Counter-Enlightenment''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62895765|title=Counter-enlightenments : from the eighteenth century to the present|last=1965-|first=Garrard, Graeme,|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0203645669|location=Abingdon [England]|oclc=62895765}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' He published widely about the Enlightenment and its challengers and did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterized as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]], and organic,&lt;ref&gt;Aspects noted by Darrin M. McMahon, "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77–112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  which he associated most closely with [[German Romanticism]].        

==Development and significant people==
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre]] was one of the more prominent altar-and-throne counter-revolutionaries who vehemently opposed Enlightenment ideas.]]

=== '''Early Stages''' ===
Despite criticism of the Enlightenment has emerged as a widely discussed topic in twentieth-century thought, the term 'Counter-Enlightenment' was underdeveloped. It was first mentioned briefly in English in [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]]'s 1949 article "Art, Aristocracy and Reason" in ''[[Partisan Review]].'' He used the term again in his 1958 book on existentialism, ''Irrational Man,'' however, his comment on Enlightenment criticism was very limited&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In Germany, the expression "Gegen-Aukflärung" has a longer history. It was probably coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in "Nachgelassene Fragmente" in 1877&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Werke: Kristische Gesamtausgabe|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1877|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Lewis White Beck]] used this term in his ''Early German Philosophy'' (1969), a book about Counter-Enlightenment in Germany. Beck claims that there is a counter-movement arising in Germany in reaction to [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick II]]'s secular authoritarian state. On the other hand, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and his fellow philosophers believe that a more organic conception of social and political life, a more vitalistic view of nature, and an appreciation for beauty and the spiritual life of man have been neglected by the eighteenth century&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== '''Isaiah Berlin''' ===
[[Isaiah Berlin]] established this term's place in the [[history of ideas]]. He used it to refer to a movement that arose primarily in late 18th- and early 19th-century Germany against the [[rationalism]], [[universalism]] and [[empiricism]], which are commonly associated with the Enlightenment. Berlin's essay "The Counter-Enlightenment" was first published in 1973, and later reprinted in a  collection of his works, ''Against the Current'', in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/ac/counter-enlightenment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been more widely used since.

[[File:Johann Georg Hamann (1730 –1788).jpg|thumb|[[Isaiah Berlin]] traces the Counter-Enlightenment back to [[J. G. Hamann]] (shown).]]

Berlin argues that, while there were opponents of the Enlightenment outside of Germany (e.g. [[Joseph de Maistre]]) and before the 1770s (e.g. [[Giambattista Vico]]), Counter-Enlightenment thought did not start until the Germans 'rebelled against the dead hand of France in the realms of culture, art and philosophy, and avenged themselves by launching the great counter-attack against the Enlightenment.' This German reaction to the imperialistic universalism of the French Enlightenment and Revolution, which had been forced on them first by the francophile [[Frederick II of Prussia]], then by the armies of Revolutionary France and finally by [[Napoleon]], was crucial to the shift of consciousness that occurred in Europe at this time, leading eventually to [[Romanticism]]. The consequence of this revolt against the Enlightenment was [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. The opponents to the Enlightenment played a more crucial role than its proponents, some of whom were [[monists]], whose political, intellectual and ideological offspring have been [[terreur]] and [[totalitarianism]].

=== '''Darrin McMahon''' ===
In his book ''Enemies of the Enlightenment'' (2001), historian [[Darrin McMahon]] extends the Counter-Enlightenment back to pre-Revolutionary France and down to the level of '[[Grub Street]],' thereby marking a major advance on Berlin's intellectual and Germanocentric view. McMahon focuses on the early opponents to the Enlightenment in France, unearthing a long-forgotten '[[Grub Street]]' literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries aimed at the ''[[Philosophy|philosophes]]''. He delves into the obscure world of the 'low Counter-Enlightenment' that attacked the ''[[encyclopédistes]]'' and fought to prevent the dissemination of Enlightenment ideas in the second half of the century. Many people from earlier times attacked the Enlightenment for undermining religion and the social and political order. It later became a major theme of conservative criticism of the Enlightenment. After the French Revolution, it appeared to vindicate the warnings of the ''[[Antiphilosophy|anti-philosophes]]'' in the decades prior to 1789.

=== '''Graeme Garrard''' ===
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Graeme Garrard]] traces the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment to [[Rousseau]].]]

[[Cardiff University]] professor Graeme Garrard claims that historian [[William Everdell|William R. Everdell]] was the first to situate Rousseau as the "founder of the Counter-Enlightenment" in his 1971 dissertation and in his 1987 book, ''Christian Apologetics in France, 1730–1790: The Roots of Romantic Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Graeme | last = Garrard | quote = To my knowledge, the first explicit identification of Rousseau as "founder of the "Counter-Enlightenment" appears in William Everdell's study of Christian apologetics in eighteenth-century France. | title = Rousseau's Counter-Enlightenment: A Republican Critique of the ''Philosophes'' | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1996 article, "the Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity", in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' (Vol. 90, No. 2), [[Arthur M. Melzer]] corroborates Everdell's view in placing the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment in the religious writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau,]] further showing Rousseau as the man who fired the first shot in the war between the Enlightenment and its opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melzer|first=Arthur M.|date=1996|title=The Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity|url=www.jstor.org/stable/2082889|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=90|pages=344-360|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Graeme Garrard]] follows Melzer in his "Rousseau's Counter-Enlightenment" (2003). This contradicts Berlin's depiction of Rousseau as a ''[[philosophe]]'' (albeit an erratic one) who shared the basic beliefs of his Enlightenment contemporaries. But similar to McMahon, Garrard traces the beginning of Counter-Enlightenment thought back to France and prior to the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement of the 1770s. Garrard's book ''Counter-Enlightenments'' (2006) broadens the term even further, arguing against Berlin that there was no single 'movement' called 'The Counter-Enlightenment'. Rather, there have been many Counter-Enlightenments, from the middle of the 18th century to 20th-century Enlightenment among critical theorists, postmodernists and feminists. The Enlightenment has opponents on all points of its ideological compass, from the far left to the far right, and all points in between. Each of the Enlightenment's challengers depicted it as they saw it or wanted others to see it, resulting in a vast range of portraits, many of which are not only different but incompatible.

=== '''James Schmidt''' ===
The idea of Counter-Enlightenment has evolved in the following years. The historian James Schmidt questioned the idea of 'Enlightenment' and therefore of the existence of a movement opposing it. As the conception of 'Enlightenment' has become more complex and difficult to maintain, so has the idea of the 'Counter-Enlightenment'. Advances in Enlightenment scholarship in the last quarter-century have challenged the stereotypical view of the 18th century as an '[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]', leading Schmidt to speculate on whether the Enlightenment might not actually be a creation of its opponents, but the other way round. The fact that the term 'Enlightenment' was first used in 1894 in English to refer to a historical period supports the argument that it was a late construction projected back onto the 18th century.

==The French Revolution==
[[File:Edmund Burke by James Northcote.JPG|thumb|Political thinker [[Edmund Burke]] opposed the [[French Revolution]] in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.]]

By the mid-1790s, the [[Reign of Terror]] during the French Revolution fueled a major reaction against the Enlightenment. Many leaders of the French Revolution and their supporters made [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], as well as [[Marquis de Condorcet]]'s ideas of reason, [[progress]], anti-clericalism, and emancipation central themes to their movement. It led to an unavoidable backlash to the Enlightenment as there were people oppose to the revolution. Many counter-revolutionary writers, such as [[Edmund Burke]], [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Augustin Barruel]], asserted an intrinsic link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. They blamed the Enlightenment for undermining traditional beliefs that sustained the [[ancien regime]]. As the Revolution became increasingly bloody, the idea of 'Enlightenment' was  discredited, too. Hence, the French Revolution and its aftermath have attributed to the development of Counter-Enlightenment thought.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}  

[[Edmund Burke]] was among the first of the Revolution's opponents to relate the ''philosophes'' to the instability in France in the 1790s. His ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) refers the Enlightenment as the principle cause of the French revolution. In Burke's opinion, the ''philosophes'' provided the revolutionary leaders with the theories on which their political schemes were based on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

[[Augustin Barruel]]'s Counter-Enlightenment ideas were well developed before the revolution. He worked as an editor for the anti-''philosophes'' literary journal, ''[[:fr:L'Année_littéraire|L'Année Littéraire]]''. Barruel argues in his ''[[Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism]]'' (1797) that the Revolution was the consequence of a conspiracy of ''philosophes'' and freemasons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

In ''Considerations on France'' (1797),  [[Joseph de Maistre]] interprets the Revolution as divine punishment for the sins of the Enlightenment. According to him, "the revolutionary storm is an overwhelming force of nature unleashed on Europe by God that mocked human pretensions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;."

==Romanticism==
In the 1770s, the '''[[Sturm und Drang]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' movement started in Germany. It questioned some key assumptions and implications of the ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Auflärung]]'' and the term '[[Romanticism]]' was first coined. Many early Romantic writers such as [[Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis|Federich von Hardenberg]] ([[Novalis|Novalis)]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] inherited the Counter-Revolutionary antipathy towards the philosophes. All three directly blamed the ''philosophes'' in France and the ''Aufklärer'' in Germany for devaluing beauty, spirit and history in favour of a view of man as a soulless machine and a view of the universe as a meaningless, disenchanted void lacking richness and beauty. One particular concern to early Romantic writers was the allegedly anti-religious nature of the Enlightenment since the ''philosophes'' and ''[[Aufklarer]]'' were generally [[deists]], opposed to [[revealed religion]]. Some historians, such as [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], nevertheless contend that this view of the Enlightenment as an age hostile to religion is common ground between these Romantic writers and many of their conservative Counter-Revolutionary predecessors. However, not many have commented on the Enlightenment, except for Chateaubriand, Novalis, and Coleridge, since the term itself did not exist at the time and most of their contemporaries ignored it&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[File:Goya - Caprichos (43) - Sleep of Reason.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'', c. 1797, 21.5 cm × 15 cm. One of the most famous prints of the ''[[Caprichos]]''.]]
The philosopher [[Jacques Barzun]] argues that Romanticism has its roots in the Enlightenment. It was not anti-rational, but rather balanced rationality against the competing claims of intuition and the sense of justice. This view is expressed in Goya's ''Sleep of Reason'', in which the nightmarish owl offers the dozing social critic of ''[[Los Caprichos]],'' a piece of drawing chalk. Even the rational critic is inspired by irrational dream-content under the gaze of the sharp-eyed lynx.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon, ''The Sleep of Reason'']&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Brown makes much the same argument as Barzun in ''Romanticism and Enlightenment'', questioning the stark opposition between these two periods.

By the middle of the 19th century, the memory of the French Revolution was fading and so was the influence of Romanticism. In this optimistic age of science and industry, there were few critics of the Enlightenment, and few explicit defenders. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is a notable and highly influential exception. After an initial defence of the Enlightenment in his so-called 'middle period' (late-1870s to early 1880s), Nietzsche turned vehemently against it.

==Totalitarianism==
In the intellectual discourse of the mid-20th century, two concepts emerged simultaneously in the West: enlightenment and [[totalitarianism]]. After [[World War II]], the former re-emerged as a key organizing concept in social and political thought and the history of ideas. The Counter-Enlightenment literature blaming the 18th-century trust in reason for 20th-century [[totalitarianism]] also resurged along with it. The ''locus classicus'' of this view is [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), which traces the degeneration of the general concept of enlightenment from ancient Greece (epitomized by the cunning 'bourgeois' hero Odysseus) to 20th-century fascism. They mentioned little about Soviet [[communism]], only referring to it as a regressive totalitarianism that "clung all too desperately to the heritage of bourgeois philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Adorno &amp; Horkeimer, [[Dialectic of Enlightenment]], 1947, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;.

The authors take 'enlightenment' as their target including its 18th-century form – which we now call 'The Enlightenment'. They claim it is epitomized by the [[Marquis de Sade]]. However, there were philosophers rejecting Adorno and Horkheimer’s claim that Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roche, "Much Sense the Starkest Madness: de Sade’s Moral Scepticism." ''Angelaki'' Volume 15, Issue 1 April 2010, pages 45 – 59. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a925285995~db=all~jumptype=rss].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many postmodern writers and feminists (e.g. Jane Flax) have made similar arguments. They regard ''the'' Enlightenment conception of reason as totalitarian, and as not having been enlightened enough since. For Adorno and Horkheimer, though it banishes myth it falls back into a further myth, that of individualism and formal (or mythic) equality under [[instrumental reason]].

[[Michel Foucault]], for example, argued that attitudes towards the "insane" during the late-18th and early 19th centuries show that supposedly enlightened notions of [[moral treatment|humane treatment]] were not universally adhered to, but instead, the [[Age of Reason]] had to construct an image of "Unreason" against which to take an opposing stand. Berlin himself, although no postmodernist, argues that the Enlightenment's legacy in the 20th century has been [[monism]] (which he claims favours political authoritarianism), whereas the legacy of the Counter-Enlightenment has been pluralism (associates with liberalism). These are two of the 'strange reversals' of modern intellectual history.

==Perversion of reason==
What seems to unite all of the Enlightenment's disparate critics from 18th-century religious opponents, counter-revolutionaries, to Romantics, to 20th-century conservatives, feminists, [[critical theorists]] and environmentalists is a rejection of what they consider to be the Enlightenment's perversion of [[reason]]: the distorted conceptions of reason associate with the Enlightenment in favour of a more restricted view of the nature, scope and limits of human rationality. Debates have occurred over the scope, meaning and application of reason, not over whether it is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, essential or inessential per se. Some charge that the Enlightenment inflated the power and scope of reason, while others claim that it narrowed it.

==The program==
The program was 9 weeks of remote work (called Phase 0) and then 9 weeks of intensive onsite training in professional [[web development]], including [[Ruby on Rails]], [[HTML5]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1815287/hacker-school-helps-solve-silicon-valleys-hiring-problem |title=A Hacker School That Helps Solve Silicon Valley's Hiring Problem |author=E.B.

The program valued learning by building and doing; in contrast to traditional classrooms, Dev Bootcamp students worked through a series of programming challenges, usually working in pairs or small groups, which culminated in a final group project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/13/dev-bootcamp/ |title=This Dev Bootcamp Will Make You More Hireable in 9 Weeks |author=Fran Berkman |newspaper=Mashable|date=13 December 2012|access-date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://devbootcamp.com/learn-more/ About].

Core class hours were weekdays 9am-6pm in San Francisco and 8am-5pm in Chicago. However, most students stayed nights and weekends, which amounted to an approximate 70–80 hours per week.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt; Dev Bootcamp organized hiring days for technology companies to interview students.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt; They then collected a [[Referral recruitment|referral fee]] from employers that hire their graduates, and they passed along part of that fee to the graduate in the form of a hiring bonus.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;

In 2015, Dev Bootcamp tested a remote teaching model in a pilot program in [[Columbus, Ohio]], which was canceled after the first round even though four of its 14 enrollees had already found jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dev Bootcamp ends Columbus pilot despite 2Checkout, CoverMyMeds, Cardinal Solutions hiring grads|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2015/05/dev-bootcamp-columbus-got-beginning-coders-jobs.html|website = Columbus Business First|accessdate = 2015-09-29|date = May 28, 2015|last = Ghose|first = Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced it was closing its doors on July 23, 2017 via a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/kaplan-owned-dev-bootcamp-shut-closing-seattle-coding-school-sites/|title=Kaplan-owned Dev Bootcamp to shut down, closing Seattle coding school and other sites|date=2017-07-13|work=GeekWire|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Phases===
The program was divided into three core phases, each lasting three weeks. In the first phase, students learned some of the fundamentals of computer programming in Ruby, including algorithms and database querying. The next phase introduced front-end technologies and combined them with previously learned material. The final phase brought everything full-circle with the [[Ruby on Rails]] framework. In this phase, students built a web application from scratch.&lt;ref name="devbootcamp.com"&gt;[http://devbootcamp.com/faq/ FAQ] "Dev Bootcamp FAQ"&lt;/ref&gt;

Students were also required to remotely complete 9 weeks of preparation material before the on-location courses began.&lt;ref name="devbootcamp.com"/&gt;

'''Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP)''' is a series of musical experiences that early childhood educators can promote to young children (birth through Age 8) during the traditional school day.  These experiences are grounded in a plethora of research studies both in the field of music education and early [[Early childhood education|childhood education]]. Essentially, DAMP provides young children with optimal learning experiences in which have a profound influence on young children’s social, emotional, physical, and [[intellectual development]].

== History of Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice ==
Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP) was coined in 2011 by music education researcher Dr. Guerino Terracciano while conducting a study for the effect of a hands-on music education in-service program on [[early childhood education|early childhood educators’]] attitude, knowledge, and self-efficacy for providing DAMP in the learning environment with young children.  Terracciano&lt;ref&gt;Terracciano, G. (2011). A Hands-On Music Education In-Service Program for Early Childhood Educators: A Quasi-Experimental Study. (Doctoral Dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database.&lt;/ref&gt; states the following:
Several studies have investigated the effect of [[music education]] on the early childhood educators’ capacity for promoting Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP) in the learning environment with young children (de l’Etoile;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de l’Etoile,|first=S.|title=An In-Service Training Program in Music for Child-Care Personnel Working with Infants and Toddlers|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholas, B. L.|title=The influence of an inservice music education program on young  Children’s responses to music (Doctoral Dissertation).|year=1993|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers, Hallam, Creech, &amp; Preti;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=L.|author2=Hallam, S. |author3=Creech, A. |author4=Preti, C. |title=‘Learning about what constitutes  effective training from a pilot programme to improve music education in primary schools’|journal=Music Education Research|year=2008|pages=485–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders &amp; Baker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=T.|author2=Baker, D. S.|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|year=1991|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).  For example, these studies show that when providing educators with quality musical resources, they are able to gain the confidence and the knowledge to successfully promote musical experiences during the traditional school day.  On the other hand, these studies also suggest that music education has an effect on the young child’s social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development.  Music education in relationship to cognitive development has been acknowledged throughout history (Dewey;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=J.|title=The school and society|year=1898|publisher=The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=H.|title=Frames of mind: The theory of multiple intelligences|year=1993|publisher=New York:  Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins, Griess, Carither, &amp; Castillo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=K.|author2=Griess, K. J. |author3=Carither, K. |author4=Castillo, D. M. |title=It’s all in the game:  Designing and playing board games to foster communication and social skill|journal=YC Young Children|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).  For example, in the areas of [[language development|language]] and [[literacy]] development young children have the propensity to learn their everyday spoken language by acquiring the vocabulary words through active engagement during music activities (Moomaw &amp; Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moomaw|first=S.|author2=Davis, J. A.|title=STEM comes to preschool|journal=YC Young Children|year=2010|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). (p.&amp;nbsp;1)

==Types of Developmentally Appropriate Musical Practice (DAMP)==

===Music and movement===

According to the book titled ''Smart Moves'', learning is not all in our head.  Hannaford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannaford|first=C.|title=Why learning is not all in your head|year=1995|publisher=Great Ocean Publisher|location=Atlanta, Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  stated that the more young children move the better they will learn. As a result, movement stimulates neurological development, which explains the potential it has on the learning process.  Consequently, Gordon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=E.|title=Rhythm: Contrasting the implications of audiation and notation|year=2000|publisher=GIA Publication, Inc|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that promoting movement while learning has the potential to expand the child’s nerve network wiring system, therefore facilitating understanding of the element of rhythm.  Gordon’s [[empirical research]] goes on to explain that young children construct musical understanding through movement.  Gordon looked at movement as an important learning process that the body must undergo in order for the learner to gain a comprehensive understanding of various elements of music, such as [[rhythm]] and [[melody]].

===The child’s singing voice and musical instruments===

Giving students the [[autonomy]] to pursue music has shown positive results in students acquiring an interest of the subject. For example, Kemple, Batey, and Hartle&lt;ref&gt;Kemple, K. M., Batey, J. J. &amp; Hartle, L. C. Music play: Creating centers for musical play and exploration. YC Young Children, 59(4).&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that exploration and play become vehicles for musical growth. When young children are given access to play a simple instrument, they unintentionally ‘construct’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=J.|title=The psychology of intelligence|year=1950|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegar Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  specific knowledge and information that relates to an area of interest. Fundamentally, through autonomous engagement young children develop intuitively an interest that the classroom teacher is not able to foster through direct instructional methods.

===Identifying sounds===

Children’s musical interest may vary from exploring a specific instrument&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, D. Music in our lives. National Association of the Education of Young Children. Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; to listening to a type of musical literature that the child finds interesting because of his or her cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=F.|title=Sensitivity to the social and cultural contexts of the play of young  children|year=2003|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, early childhood musical interest lies with the involvement that the child is actively engaged in the learning milieu.  Morin’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=F.|title=Cultivating music play: The need for changed teaching practice|journal=General Music Today|year=2001|volume=14|series=2|pages=pg. 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  article suggests that in order for students to develop a personal interest during the exploration of music, they need opportunities and experiences that have been aligned by the educator as developmentally appropriate. In essence, Morin communicates about the importance of giving young children ample opportunities to explore, manipulate, and play in the classroom.

===Emergent literacy skills and musical concepts and methods===

Historically, [[music]] education has been deemed an important subject in the lives of young children during their daily learning experiences (Monroe;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=W.|title=Comenius and the beginning of educational reform|year=1900|publisher=Scribner’s|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rousseau|first=J.|title=Rousseau on education|year=1928|publisher=Edward  Arnold|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|first=D.|title=Montessori music for young children|journal=Young Children|year=1983|volume=39|series=1|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brosterman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brosterman|first=N.|title=Brosterman, N. Inventing kindergarten. New York: Abrams.|year=1997|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). Since 1838, The Boston School Committee in the United States adopted music as a branch of instruction in their public school system for the purpose of positively affecting students’ academic potential (Abeles, Hoffer, &amp; Klotman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abeles|first=H.|title=Foundations of music education|year=1994|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). During this period, music was given importance, based on the assumption that it could humanize, refine, and elevate our elementary learning communities through listening and singing (Greata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greata|first=J.|title=An introduction to music in early childhood education|year=2006|publisher=Thomson   Delmar Learning|location=New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Subsequently, one of the first decisions for music instruction was related to its capacity and potential in fostering intellectual growth (Dewey;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=J.|title=The school and society|year=1898|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seefeldt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seefeldt|first=C.|title=Art-serious work.|journal=Young Children|year=1995|volume=50|series=3|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

'''Dinosaur Zoo''' is an educational app built as a collaboration between Swedish-based Dotnamestudios and UK-based Thumbspark interactive and was first released for [[Apple, Inc.|Apple's]] [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]]. It is available exclusively through Apple's app store and ported to the [[iPad]] [[Handheld game console|console]] and [[iPhone]] as a universal build, free additional dinosaurs are periodically added. It is an attempt to take the serious prehistoric digital reconstructions and information from leading paleontologists and expose them together with current knowledge on specific species in a more accessible medium. Dinosaur Zoo was released on [[iTunes]] May 2011.

Users tap, stroke and roar at the screen and the various animals display their hunting and defensive techniques. Pop-up panels give a detailed account of the animal based on current palentological knowledge. Additional animals then become available in the form of extension packs for users to customise their menagerie.

==Gameplay==

'''Interaction'''
[[File:dinosaur Zoo monolophosaurus in game.png|thumb|left|Monolophosaurus bites at a tap on the screen.]]
The users are provided with prehistoric animals in a suitable environment and the animals react to tapping, stroking and sound by demonstrating their defense strategies or hunting techniques. 
Gameplay is limited to simple interaction and there are no points, level-based reward system or assets which can be unlocked.

===Information===
The current state of paleontological knowledge is given in graphics and brief, accessible explanations.
A series of panels supply maps where the fossils were discovered, paleogeographical maps showing where and when the animal lived, and the animal's vital statistics.
Accurate rotating digital reconstructions with highlighted paleontological aspects show our current physiological understanding of the animal.

==Production==
Production began in 2010 and was completed and released in May 2011. Dinosaur Zoo was initially developed under the name Dinosaur Safari but later renamed in order to shorten the name for iTunes. The project was directed by Andrew Kerr and code development was provided by Thumbspark. Digital models and animation were provided by Dotnamestudios.

==Development==
An iPhone version is now available for ''[[iPhone|Iphones]]'' and an android tablet version is currently under discussion but awaiting a clear market leader in the Android tablet market.

'''Distribution'''
Dinosaur Zoo is currently solely distributed through iTunes and is available only for iPads and iPhones.

==Accuracy==
&lt;br /&gt;'''MODELS'''
All the dinosaur models have been signed off as accurate by leading palentologists and many have appeared in several other publications such as [[Prehistoric Life (book)|Prehistoric Life: The definitive guide]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DK Publishing |title=Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7566-5573-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dinosaur World &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carlton |title=Dinosaur World |publisher=Carlton |location=Oxford |year=2011 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Dinosaurs: A Visual Encyclopedia
&lt;br /&gt;'''COLORATION'''
The coloration is still a matter of conjecture as solid evidence of particular dinosaur colouration is scant although recent clues from the recently discovered [[Hadrosaur]] and fossilized skin fragments from [[sinosauropteryx]] suggest both crytic patterns and bright colours are in evidence.
&lt;br /&gt;'''ENVIRONMENTS'''
[[File:dinosaur zoo kentosaurus.png|thumb|left|Kentrosaurus with modern-day blue-bells in the background.]]
Critics have suggested two errors in the background environments, the blue-bell flowers in the [[Kentrosaurus]] environment and the modern variety of banana trees in the [[Muttaburrasaurus]] environment were unlikely to be present during the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] Periods.
&lt;br /&gt;'''AUDIO'''
In the audio of some scenes, there are sounds of modern-day frogs, although it is again conjecture to assume prehistoric frogs sounded much different.
&lt;br /&gt;'''PALEOGEOGRAPHIC MAPS'''
The maps are accurate in form, although the pin-point location is somewhat broad.
&lt;br /&gt;'''SCALE'''
On the “relative to an average human male” scale, Dinosaur Zoo has tended towards the maximum size of each animal rather than the median.
&lt;br /&gt;'''TIME PERIODS'''
The time periods are mostly accurate, except for the [[Ornithocheirus]], which is said to live in the [[Middle Jurassic]], when in reality it lived in the [[Early Cretaceous]]; this was most likely a mistake.

'''Formative assessments''' are check points during the [[learning process]]. Unlike [[summative assessment]]s, that check for understanding at the end of learn, formative assessments come in during learning. and “Formative assessments support learning during the learning process. They serve as practice for students, just like a meaningful [[homework]] assignment. They check for understanding along the way and guide teacher decision making about future instruction.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 25 Quick Formative Assessments for a Differentiated Classroom|last = Dodge|first = Judith|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formative assessments give teachers a chance to break down complex ideas into smaller understandable pieces. This allows teachers to correct “mistakes” and fine tune skills before summative assessments.

'''I thought you said sports?'''

While formative assessment is mostly talked about in the classroom it can also be used in [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]]. Think about the process in learning a new sport. We take the whole sport and break it down into simple steps. Along the way we have coaches giving us specific feed back.  We don’t teach a new sport to kids by having them go out and play in a game right away. If we did, our feedback after our summative assessment (their game) would likely be negative. Instead along the way we break sports up into drills and game like situations. This allows coaches to give athletes feedback and make corrections before the game. The process of breaking “chunking” a sport can be broken down into three parts: drill, situations, and competitions. Each one of these is a stepping stone to the next. Even during competitions adjustments and learning can occur.

'''Drill'''

We take a sport and break it down to simple moves. Like dribbling a [[basketball]] or shooting a [[single leg takedown]]. While we are working on simple moves, coaches are looking for specific things. Where are the athlete’s eyes? Are their feet moving in the right direction? These things are considered our success criteria for each drill. Coaches use these to give athletes’ feedback in order for them to successfully complete the drill. By providing good feedback like, “keep your eyes up when dribbling,” or, “your left foot is sliding to the right,” coaches are giving pointers to the learner that they can immediately work on correcting. "The principle of specificity in training states that the body will adapt to the specific imposed [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. Therefore, if an athlete desires to improve in a specific skill, movement, or exercise, he or she must perform that exercise in training with multiple variations, or tweaks, to that drill. Because of the complexity of the human structure and human movement, specificity is paramount in training to reach the desired outcome. Another layer to this philosophy is that if the test is the exercise, then if the exercise is properly tweaked (complex variations), it will provide the best opportunity for an improved outcome '''."'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Training for Speed, Agility, and Quickness-3rd Edition|last = Ferrigno and Brown|first = Vance and Lee|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to achieve the desired outcome is to drill and tweak until we get to the desired outcome.

'''Takedown Drill -'''  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfu1ikO__-s

'''Situations'''

Coaches put athletes in live situations all the time. [[Full-court press]]es, [[fumble]]s on the football field, [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]]ing with man on bases are just a few examples. These situations are assessing a team's response to the situation. The coach can tell if the team has specifics areas they need to work on. Maybe the pitcher needs to cover first base, but was unaware of that until the situation. By chunking up a game into situations coaches are able to simulate games while keeping the ability to give instruction and instant feedback. "[[Simulation]] training enables athletes to develop and master the skills they will need to maintain optimal focus and perform their best in competition. In simulated competitions, athletes become aware of what they will confront in actual competition." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applying Sport Psychology: Four Perspectives|last = Taylor and Wilson|first = Jim and Gregory|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Competitions'''

The last way coaches can use formative assessment is during a competition. While some may see this as the summative assessment, I believe that happens as a team looks back on the season as a whole. During competitions coaches might praise specific things and athlete is doing, “good coverage on the receiver, turn your hips with him right away.” Coaches can also give feedback during halftime or the end of a quarter. “We are giving the [[quarterback]] open passing lanes in the middle. Our middle [[linebacker]] should line up five yards off the ball instead of three.” These are formative assessments made during the progression of competitions.

{{Glossary of education-related terms TOC}}

==M==
* '''[[Mastery learning]]:''' An instructional method that presumes all children can learn if they are provided with the appropriate learning conditions. Specifically, mastery learning is a method whereby students are not advanced to a subsequent learning objective until they demonstrate proficiency with the current one.
* '''[[Master's in European Business|MEB]]:''' A [[Master's degree|Master's]] in European Business providing knowledge and skills both in Economics and Management.
* '''[[Mathematics education]]:''' The study of practices and methods of both the teaching and learning of [[mathematics]]. Furthermore, mathematics educators are concerned with the development of tools that facilitate practice and/or the study of practice. Mathematics education has been a hotly debated subject in modern society. There is an ambiguity in the term for it refers both to these practices in classrooms around the world, but also to an emergent discipline with its own journals, conferences, etc. The main international body involved is the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction.
* '''[[Medical education]]:''' Education related to the practice of being a [[medical doctor|medical practitioner]], either the initial training to become a doctor or further training thereafter.
:Medical education and training varies considerably across the world. Various teaching methodologies have been utilised in medical education, which is an active area of educational research.

* '''[[Memory]]:''' The ability of the brain to store, retain, and subsequently recall information. Although traditional studies of memory began in the realms of [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth century put memory within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In the recent decades, it has become one of the principal pillars of a new branch of science that represents a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]], called [[cognitive neuroscience]].
* '''[[Mentoring]]:''' A developmental relationship between a more experienced '''mentor''' and a less experienced partner referred to as a mentee or protégé. Usually - but not necessarily - the mentor/protégé pair will be of the same sex.
:The roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of [[Mentor]] in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]]. Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess [[Athena]] takes on his appearance in order to guide young [[Telemachus]] in his time of difficulty.
:Historically significant systems of mentorship include [[apprentice|apprenticing]] under the medieval [[guild]] system, and the [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship system practiced by both [[Rabbi]]nical [[Judaism]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] church.

[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|150px|right|thumb|University (1350s).]]
* '''[[Medieval university]]:''' The first [[Europe]]an medieval institutions generally considered to be [[universities]] were established in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[England]] in the late 11th and the 12th Century for the study of [[Liberal arts|arts]], [[law]], [[medicine]], and [[theology]]. These universities evolved from much older schools and monasteries, and it is difficult to define the first date at which they became true [[universities]] for teaching higher education, although the lists of [[studium generale|studia generali]] for higher education in Europe held by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] are a useful guide. Some other institutions such as the imperial university of [[Constantinople]] claim that they changed from schools to universities as early as the 11th Century.
* '''[[Medieval university (Asia)]]:''' Medieval universities did not exist in Asia in the strict sense of the phrase. However, there were important centres of learning that can be compared to the universities of Europe. Unlike the European universities, non-western institutions of higher learning were never known to issue degrees to their graduates and therefore do not meet what many hold to be the technical definition of [[university]]. This does not, however, bar their importance to the history of non-western cultures.
* '''[[Meta-]]:''' In [[epistemology]], the prefix '''meta-''' is used to mean ''about (its own category)''. For example, [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] is data about data (who has produced it, when, what format the data is in and so on). Similarly, meta-memory in psychology means an individual's intuition about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. Any subject can be said to have a ''meta-theory'', which is the theoretical consideration of its foundations and methods.
* '''[[Metacognition]]:''' Refers to [[thinking]] about [[cognition]] ([[memory]], [[perception]], [[calculation]], [[association (psychology)|association]], etc.) itself. Metacognition can be divided into two types of [[knowledge]]: explicit, [[conscious]], factual knowledge; and implicit, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], procedural knowledge. The ability to think about thinking is unique to sapient species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience. Metacognition is practiced to attempt to regulate one's own cognition, and maximize one's potential to think, [[learning|learn]] and process stimuli from the surroundings.

[[Image:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Allegory of Music, by Lorenzo Lippi]]
* '''[[Methodology]]:''' Strictly speaking is the study and knowledge of methods; but the term is frequently used pretentiously to indicate a method or a set of methods. In other words, it is the '''study''' of techniques for problem-solving and seeking answers, as opposed to the techniques themselves.
* '''[[Military education and training]]:'''Process that intends to educate in combat and in situations of war.
* '''[[Mind map]]:''' (or '''mind-map''') A [[diagram]] used for linking [[words]] and [[idea]]s to a central key word or idea. It is used to [[visualization (graphic)|visualize]], [[taxonomic classification|classify]], [[structure]], and [[generation|generate]] ideas, as well as an aid in study, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]].
* '''[[Mind uploading]]''' The [[Futurology|futurist]] high technology to rapidly increase the speed of information exchange to neurology. A form of education that focuses on extreme time efficiency.
* '''[[Motivation]]:''' The driving force behind all [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s of [[human beings]] and other [[animal]]s. It is an internal state that activates behavior and gives it direction. [[Emotion]] is closely related to motivation, and may be regarded as the subjectively experienced component of motivational states.
* '''[[Music education]]:''' Comprises the application of [[education]] methods in teaching [[music]].

==N==

* '''[[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], Inc.:''' ('''NAACP LDF''' or simply '''LDF''') A leading [[United States]] [[civil rights]] organization. It was founded in 1940 under the leadership of [[Thurgood Marshall]] as part of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and spun out as a separate organization in 1957.
* '''[[National Educational Television]]:''' ('''NET''') was an educational [[television]] [[television network|network]] in the [[United States|USA]] from 1952 until 1970 and was the predecessor of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]].
* '''[[National postgraduate representative body]]:''' Exists in many countries representing [[postgraduate]] students/researchers undertaking their [[doctorate]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) or [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]]. Some have a broader remit to represent all postgraduates, including those taking [[Master's degree]]s. A few countries have no specific body but are represented by a national body representing all students, including [[undergraduates]]. In Europe many of the national organisations have come together under the federation [[Eurodoc]].
* '''[[Network of practice]]:''' Builds on the work on [[community of practice|communities of practice]] by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in the early 1990s, [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid (2000) developed the concept of networks of [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] (often abbreviated as NoPs).  This concept refers to the overall set of various types of informal, emergent [[social networks]] that facilitate [[learning]] and [[knowledge]] sharing between individuals conducting practice-related tasks.  In other words, networks of practice range from communities of practice to electronic networks of practice (often referred to as virtual or electronic communities).
* '''[[Nines System]]:''' The informal name for a [[grade (education)|grading scale]] often used at educational institutions in [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, particularly the [[United States]].
:The system owes its name to the fact that each of the top four letter grades in it cover a range of nine points.  The minimum passing mark under it is almost always 65%, or five points higher than in the more widely used [[Tens System]].

[[Image:Mindmap.gif|thumb|right|150px|Notes on a mind map]]
* '''[[Normal school]]:''' An [[educational]] [[institution]] for training [[teacher]]s. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or ''norms'', hence its name. The term ''normal school'' is now archaic in all but a few countries. In [[New Zealand]], for example, normal schools are affiliated with [[Teachers college]]s. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', normal schools in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] trained [[Primary education|primary school]] teachers, while in [[Europe]], normal schools educated primary, [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]]-level teachers.
* '''[[Notetaking]]:''' The practice of [[writing]] pieces of information, often in an informal or unstructured manner.  One major specific type of notetaking is the practice of writing in [[shorthand]], which can allow large amounts of information to be put on [[paper]] very quickly.  Notes are frequently written in [[notebook]]s, though any available piece of paper can suffice in many circumstances&amp;mdash;some people are especially fond of [[Post-It]] notes, for instance.  Notetaking is an important [[skill]] for [[student]]s, especially at the [[college]] level.  Many different forms are used to structure information and make it easier to find later.  [[Computer]]s, particularly [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) are beginning to see wide use as notetaking devices.
* '''[[Numeracy]]:''' A term that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] as a contraction of "numerical literacy". In the [[United States]], it is somewhat better known as "[[Quantitative Literacy]]," and is familiar to [[mathematics|math]] [[mathematics education|educators]] and [[intellectual]]s but not in the common usage. Innumeracy is the absence of numeracy.

[[File:Kaitlyn reads a book..jpg|right|thumb|150px|Young children learn very quickly.]]
* '''[[Nursery school]]:''' (or '''preschool''') A [[school]] for the [[education]] of very young [[children]] (generally five years of age and younger).  These schools range from schools which seek to teach young children to schools which only provide childcare with little educational benefits.  Schools which focus on education generally teach early social skills including interpersonal interaction, being a part of a [[peer group|group of peers]], and [[classroom]] skills such as following the instructions of a [[teacher]].  Some formal education also takes place, such as early reading or language skills.  Some nursery schools have adopted specialized methods of teaching, such as [[Montessori method|Montessori]], High Scope, [[Reggio Emilia approach]] and various other pedagogy.

==O==

* '''[[Educational aims and objectives|Objective]]:''' An educational objective is a statement of a goal which successful participants are expected demonstrably to achieve before the course or unit completes.
* '''[[Objectivity (philosophy)]]:''' Has various meanings in [[philosophy]], and is surely one of the most important philosophical problems, since it concerns the [[epistemology|epistemological]] status of [[knowledge]], the problem of an [[objective reality]] and the question of our [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] relationship to others [[object (philosophy)|object]]s in the [[world]].
* '''[[Obscurantism]]:''' Opposition to extension or dissemination of [[knowledge]] beyond certain limits and to questioning [[dogma]]s. Obscurantism is the opposite of [[freethought]] and is often associated with [[religious]] [[fundamentalism]] by its opponents. Indeed, it is a commonly raised accusation in debates on [[academic freedom]], with [[anti-communism|anti-communists]] and others associating it with the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] and his followers (including [[Karl Marx]]) and more recently with opponents of [[Martin Heidegger]] doing the same.
* '''[[Observation]]:''' An activity of a [[sapience|sapient]] or [[Sentience|sentient]] [[life|living being]], which senses and assimilates the [[knowledge]] of a [[phenomenon]] in its framework of  previous knowledge and [[idea]]s.
* '''[[Observational learning]]:''' (or '''social learning''') Learning that occurs as a function of observing, retaining and replicating behavior observed in others. It is most associated with the work of psychologist [[Albert Bandura]], who implemented some of the seminal studies in the area and initiated '''social learning theory'''. Although observational learning can take place at any stage in life, it is thought to be particularly important during [[childhood]], particularly as [[authority]] becomes important.
* '''''[[Of Education]]:''''' Published in 1644, first appearing anonymously as a single eight-page quarto sheet (Ainsworth 6).  Presented as a letter written in response to a request from the Puritan educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]], it represents [[John Milton]]'s most comprehensive statement on educational reform, and gives voice to his views “concerning the best and noblest way of education”.  As outlined in the tractate, education carried for Milton a dual objective:  one public, to “fit a man to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war”; and the other private, to “repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love Him, to be like Him, as we may the nearest by possessing our soul of true virtue”.
* '''[[Open problem]]:''' A problem that can be formally stated and for which a solution is known to exist but which has not yet been solved. It is common in [[graduate school]]s to point out open problems to students.
* '''[[Operant conditioning]]:''' (so named by [[psychologist]] [[B. F. Skinner]]) The modification of [[behavior]] brought about over time by the consequences of said behavior. ''Operant conditioning'' is distinguished from [[Pavlovian conditioning]] in that operant conditioning deals with voluntary behavior explained by its consequences, while [[Pavlovian conditioning]] deals with involuntary behavior triggered by its [[wikt:antecedent|antecedent]]s.

[[Image:CircleOfFriends.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Participants on a [[ropes course]].]]
* '''[[Outdoor education]]:''' (also known as '''adventure education''') Usually refers to organized learning that takes place in the [[outdoors]]. Programs often involve residential or [[Travel|journey]]-based experiences in which students participate in a variety of adventurous challenges such as [[hiking]], [[climbing]], [[canoeing]], [[ropes course]]s, and [[group-dynamic game|group games]]. Outdoor education programs draw upon the philosophy and theory of [[experiential education]] and may also focus on [[environmental education]].
* '''[[Overlearning]]:''' A [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] concept according to which newly acquired skills should be practiced well beyond the point of initial mastery, leading to [[automaticity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3071">'''HSED''' or '''High School Equivalency Diploma'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/HSED|publisher=Farlex|title=HSED|journal=TheFreeDictionary|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''HEP'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/hep/index.html|accessdate=2009-06-24|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|title=Migrant Education--High School Equivalency Program }}&lt;/ref&gt; is comparable to achieving a high school diploma instead of simply proving the skills by taking the [[GED]]. Sometimes it can be synonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.education.alberta.ca/students/grad/hsed.aspx|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2009-06-24|page=About High School Equivalency Diploma}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When spelled ''HSed'' it can mean ''home schooled''.

In some places, such as [[Wisconsin]], the ''HSED'' is equivalent to a high school diploma because the Department of Public Instruction awards the credential.  It is different from the [[GED]] which only certifies the individual has the equivalent of a traditional high school education.  Similar programs can be found in other states such as California.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.chspe.net/about/|publisher=Sacramento County Office of Education |title=California High School Proficiency Examination|accessdate=2009-06-24|page=About the Test}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are five ways to achieve the HSED according to the Wisconsin State Law setting up the HSED:

:*PI 5.05 - Take the GED tests and pass three other skill required courses plus a career counseling section.''
:*PI 5.06 - Complete unfinished high school credits at a local high school or college.''
:*PI 5.07 - Attain 24 semester or 32 quarter credits at a university or technical college; electives are allowed.''
:*PI 5.08 - Have a foreign degree or diploma.''
:*PI 5.09 - Go through an approved special high school completion program offered by a technical college or other group.''&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Public Education"&gt;{{citation

The '''History of [[Indian Institutes of Technology]]''' refers to the history of the IITs. It is a collection of events and developments that had a bearing on their past and will affect their future.

==Pre-independence developments==
The concept of the IITs originated even before India gained [[independence]] in 1947. After the end of the Second World War and before India got independence, [[Sir Ardeshir Dalal]] from the [[Viceroy's Executive Council]] foresaw that the future prosperity of India would depend not so much on capital as on technology. He, therefore, proposed the setting up of the [[CSIR India|Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]. To man those laboratories, he persuaded the US government to offer hundreds of doctoral fellowships under the Technology Cooperation Mission (TCM) program. However realizing that such steps can not help in the long run for the development of India after it gains independence, he conceptualized institutes that would train such work forces in the country itself. This is believed to be the first conceptualization of IITs.

==Developments leading to the first IIT==
Dr [[Humayun Kabir]] encouraged Dr [[B. C. Roy]], the Chief Minister of [[West Bengal]] to work on Sir Ardeshir's proposal for an IIT. It is also possible that Sir [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|J.C. Ghosh]], the then Director of the [[Indian Institute of Science]], Bangalore, prompted him to do so. In 1946, Dr Kabir along with [[Sir Jogendra Singh]] of the Viceroy's Executive Council (Department of Education, Health and Agriculture) set up a committee to prepare a proposal, and made Sir [[Nalini Ranjan Sarkar]] the chairman. The Sarkar Committee was taking too much time, but Dr Roy did not wait for the Committee to finalise its report and started working on the interim draft itself. The 22 member committee (in its interim draft) [http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/institute/history.php recommended the establishment] of ''Higher Technical Institutions'' in the Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern regions of the country. These institutes were recommended to have a number of secondary institutions affiliated to them. The draft also urged the speedy establishment of all the four institutions with the ones in the East and the West to be started immediately. The committee also felt that such institutes should not only produce undergraduates but should be engaged in research – producing research workers and technical teachers as well. The standard of the graduates was recommended to be at par with those from elite institutions abroad. They felt that the proportion of undergraduates and postgraduate students should be 2:1.

[[L. S. Chandrakant]] and [[Biman Sen]] in the Education Ministry played significant role in producing a blueprint for a truly autonomous educational institution. Sir [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|J.C. Ghosh]] (later to be the first Director of [[IIT Kharagpur]]) ensured liberal provisions of the IIT Act allowing the IITs to work free from interference from the ''babudom''. It is largely because of the IIT Act that IIT directors were granted authority superseding even some parts of the government. On the ground Bengal had the highest concentration of engineering industries, the Committee suggested that an IIT may be set up in that state. This encouraged Dr. Roy. to use that fragment of a report in order to persuade [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]] to push through a special Act to establish an IIT in Bengal.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nehru laying foundation stone of IITKGP.jpg|thumb|200px|Jawaharlal Nehru laying foundation stone of IIT Kharagpur]] --&gt;

With the recommendations of the Sarkar committee in view and on the basis of blueprint made by L. S. Chandrakant, Biman Sen, and Sir [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|J.C. Ghosh]], the first Indian Institute of Technology was born in May, 1950 at the site of [[Hijli Detention Camp]] in [[Kharagpur]], a town in eastern India. Initially the IIT started functioning from 5, [[Esplanade, Calcutta|Esplanade East]], [[Calcutta]][ (now [[Kolkata]]) and shifted to Hijli in September, 1950 when Sir [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|J.C. Ghosh]] offered the place as a ready made place for the IIT. The present name 'Indian Institute of Technology' was adopted before the formal inauguration of the Institute on 18 August 1951, by [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]]. On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India passed an act known as the ''Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act'' declaring it as an Institute of National Importance. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur in 1956, said:
{{cquote|Here in the place of that Hijli Detention Camp stands the fine monument of India, representing India's urges, India's future in the making. This picture seems to me symbolical of the changes that are coming to India."&lt;ref name="Nehru speech"&gt;[http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/institute/history.php IIT Kharagpur's History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813213137/http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/institute/history.php |date=13 August 2007 }} on IIT Kharagpur's Website. URL accessed on 28 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The next four IITs==
To counter the criticisms of setting up IIT in West Bengal, the draft report suggested that a second IIT may be located in the Western Region to serve the process industries concentrated there. It also added that a third IIT should be considered for the North to promote the vast irrigation potential of the Gangetic basin. Not willing to leave South out (and to make it politically correct), the draft report hinted that a fourth one might be considered for the South too. However, it offered no specific economic justification for the same.

When the pressure started building up to set up IIT in the West, Jawaharlal Nehru sought Soviet assistance in order to set up the institute in Mumbai. [[Krishna Menon]] (the then Defence Minister) and closest to the Russians, got [[Brig Bose]] appointed the first Director of [[IIT Bombay]] when it got established in [[Powai]] in 1958. As a fallout of the prevailing [[Cold War]], the Americans offered to help to set up yet another IIT. The way the Sarcar Committee had suggested, it was established in the North as [[IIT Kanpur]] (in Kanpur, [[Uttar Pradesh]]) in 1959. Dr Kelkar was the first Director of the institute.

At that time, the [[Germany|Germans]] had run up large trade surpluses, and they were persuaded to support an IIT in the South. The Germans had initially decided on [[Bangalore]] as the location but when they visited [[Madras]], [[C. Subramaniam]], the Education Minister, took them round the Governor's estate with frolicking deer roaming among hundreds of venerable banyan trees, and offered the space across the table. The visiting German team was considerably impressed by it and Madras got the fourth IIT in 1959 itself as [[IIT Madras]].

R. N. Dogra the Chief Engineer of [[Chandigarh]] persuaded Prof M. S. Thacker, then Member of the Planning Commission to set up an IIT at [[Delhi]] on the ground that the country was divided into five regions, and all but the North had an IIT each. It was done on the basis of the logic that [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] constituted the Central Region. Hence, officially, Kanpur was located in the Central Region, not the North. This led to the establishment of [[IIT Delhi]] in 1961. The Indian Institutes of Technology Act was suitably amended to reflect the addition of new IITs.&lt;ref name="IIT act"&gt;[http://www.iitb.ac.in/legal/IITsAct.pdf Indian Institute of Technology Act, 1961] on IIT Bombay's Website. URL accessed on 2006-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment of IIT Guwahati and IIT Roorkee==
After the establishment of IIT in Delhi, there was a long gap in any notable development in the history of IITs. However, in the beginning of the 1990s, widespread student agitations in [[Assam]] led to Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] promising another IIT in Assam. Rajiv Gandhi agreed to it on the spot considering it a minor request of IIT although eventually it cost over Rs 1,500 crore. The [[IIT Guwahati]] campus was established in 1994 and started functioning in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IIT, Guwahati|url=http://www.iitg.ac.in/home/pagesin/1|website=Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the 21st century, Dr [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] (the Education Minister of India) made [[University of Roorkee]] into an IIT, making [[IIT Roorkee]] the newest IIT but the oldest institution amongst the seven in 2001.

==Establishment of eight new IITs==
Establishment of the eight new IITs began with decision of the cabinet, which was announced by the Minister of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Arjun Singh, on 28 March 2008 that the government planned to establish more IITs, Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and Central Universities across the country. Six IITs at Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Patna and Ropar began functional from 2008 while other two at Indore and Mandi commenced their sessions from 2009.

==Conversion of IIT (BHU) Varanasi==
In order to establish more IITs in India, MHRD constituted Professor S K Joshi Committee in 2003 and Anand Krishnan Committee in 2005 to recommend names of existing institutes that had the potential of being converted into an IIT institute, both of which had recommended for the conversion of the IT-BHU into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). On 17 July 2008, the government of India issued a press release granting "In principle approval for taking over the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University – a constituent unit of the Banaras Hindu University, a Central University, its conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology and integrating it with the IIT system in the country." After the approval of BHU Executive Council, a Bill was introduced on 4 August 2010 a bill seeking to amend the Institutes of Technology Act 1961 to declare IT-BHU as an IIT. The Bill was eventually signed by the President of India on 20 June 2012 and notified in the gazette on 21 June. The Central Government released a notification on 29 June that as per the Act, the transformation process was complete and the erstwhile IT-BHU was renamed as [[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi]].&lt;ref name="Gazette Notification"&gt;[http://www.itbhuglobal.org/IIT-Amendment-Act-2012.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion of ISM Dhanbad and establishment of six new IITs==
The proposal for conversion of ISM Dhanbad into an IIT had been strongly recommended in 1994 by a Government Committee, headed by Prof. S. Sampath (former Director of IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras). However, no action was taken by the Government over the proposal.

Several years later, in 2007-08, several new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) like IIT Patna were set up without even having a campus, while ISM was not converted into IIT. This was despite the fact that since 1997, ISM was taking in IIT-JEE qualified students (along with the 7 older IIT's and IT-BHU). After the conversion of IT-BHU to IIT-BHU in June 2012, ISM was the only non-IIT institute which admitted IIT-JEE (now called IIT-JEE Advanced) qualified students to its various undergraduate and dual degree programmes. Once admitted into ISM or an IIT through IIT-JEE (Advanced) exam, a student was not permitted to appear in the exam again, and hence could not take admission in an IIT next year (as per rules of the JEE Advanced exam). In this respect, Govt of India treated ISM at par with IITs.

In 2009, ISM got the approval of its Finance Committee, Executive Board and General Council, proposing its conversion to an IIT. This was forwarded to Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Government of India in early 2010. This was followed by a detailed project report on the conversion prepared by EdCIL (a Public Sector Enterprise), on the directions of the HRD Ministry. The ISM Teachers Association and ISM Alumni Association passed resolutions in 2010-11, favoring this conversion. In September 2011, a resolution was passed by the Government of Jharkhand, recommending to the Government of India to convert ISM to an IIT soon.

On 7 May 2012, the Director of ISM gave a detailed presentation highlighting the various aspects of institute and the need for its conversion to an IIT, at the Yojana Bhawan, Planning commission. The meeting was chaired by Narendra Jadhav, Member of MHRD. The conclusion that came to be was inclusion of the conversion in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17).

In June 2012, a Planning Commission panel, on a reference to it from the Union Cabinet, favoured that this conversion be done, during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) and in such a possible way that ISM's core competency in mining and geology is maintained.

The proposal to convert ISM to IIT became a part of the 12th Five Year Plan after its passage by the Prime Minister headed National Development Council or NDC, on 27 December 2012. ISM was the only institute of India selected by NDC to be converted into an IIT in the 12th Five Year Plan.

Finally, the Union Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley, during his budget speech in Parliament on 28 February 2015, had proposed to upgrade ISM Dhanbad into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). On May 25, 2016, the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Modi approved that a bill be introduced in Parliament for converting ISM Dhanbad into an IIT.

On 25 May 2016, the Union Cabinet passed a draft Bill proposed to set up 6 new IITs and convert ISM Dhanbad into a full-fledged IIT. On 19 July 2016 the said Bill, named '''The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2016''' was introduced in the Lok Sabha. '''On 25 July 2016, the mentioned Bill was passed without any opposition by the Lok Sabha.'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://164.100.47.192/Loksabha/Legislation/billspassed.aspx|title=Legislation : Loksaha|last=|first=|date=|website=164.100.47.192|publisher=Lok Sabha, Parliament of India|access-date=2016-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329061429/http://164.100.47.192/Loksabha/Legislation/billspassed.aspx|archivedate=29 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 2016, the IIT Amendment Bill 2016 (for conversion of ISM DHANBAD to IIT(ISM) DHANBAD and including setting up of 6 new IITs ) was passed by Rajya Sabha.

The Bill was eventually signed by the President of India on 10 August and notified in the Gazette of India &lt;ref&gt;http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/171218.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ISM Dhanbad was renamed as [[Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad]]

'''''Ideas''''' is a long-running scholarly [[radio documentary]] show on [[CBC Radio One]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/programming/radio/ideas Ideas]. [[Canadian Communications Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Co-created by [[Phyllis Webb]] and William A. Young, the show premiered in 1965 under the title ''The Best Ideas You'll Hear Tonight''. It is currently hosted by [[Paul Kennedy (host)|Paul Kennedy]] and is broadcast between 9:05 and 10:00 P.M. weekday evenings; one episode each week is repeated on Friday afternoons under the title ''Ideas in the Afternoon''.

The show describes itself as a radio program on contemporary thought. The subject matter of the shows varies, but music, philosophy, science, religion, and especially history are common topics. The show has won many plaudits for its quality and depth.

The series is notable for soliciting programming proposals from people who are not professional broadcasters, and having the successful applicants write and host their own documentaries (aided in production by CBC staff producers).  Many ''Ideas'' programs are multi-part, with two, three, four, or more fifty-five-minute programs devoted to a single topic.  Transcripts and audio recordings of many programs are made available, and sold directly by the CBC.

Notable CBC staff producers who have been associated with the program include [[Bernie Lucht]], [[Geraldine Sherman (Canadian radio producer and journalist)|Geraldine Sherman]], Damiano Pietropaolo, [[Phyllis Webb]], and [[David Cayley]].  Individual programs are produced at CBC Radio One facilities across Canada. Documentarian [[William Whitehead (Canadian writer)|William Whitehead]] also wrote or cowrote a number of shows for ''Ideas''.&lt;ref name=nextchapter&gt;''[[The Next Chapter (radio program)|The Next Chapter]]'', April 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A television version for [[CBC News Network]], ''Ideas on TV,'' was short-lived.  The book ''Ideas: Brilliant Thinkers Speak Their Minds'', edited by Bernie Lucht, commemorated the series' 40th anniversary.

The show broadcasts Canada's annual [[Massey Lectures]], [[LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium|Lafontaine-Baldwin Lecture]], and the [[Munk Debates]]. Since 2006, they have included the [[Henry G. Friesen]] lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcihr.ca/prize/friends-of-cihr-cbc-radio-one-ideas-paul-kennedy Acknowlegements]&lt;/ref&gt;
Audio downloads of many episodes are available from the CBC website, as well as via the CBC Ideas [[podcast]], which was, by popular demand, one of the first to be included in the network's large podcasting initiative begun in 2005. Many episodes are also available for sale on audio CD.

In January 2014, ''Ideas'' broadcast a two-part documentary about Wikipedia entitled "The Great Book of Knowledge", produced and narrated by [[Philip Coulter (Canadian producer)|Philip Coulter]]. Part 1 of the documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2014/01/15/the-great-book-of-knowledge-part-1/ |title=The Great Book of Knowledge Part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  aired on January 15 and Part 2 on January 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2014/01/22/the-great-book-of-knowledge-part-2-1// |title=The Great Book of Knowledge Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2014, both episodes were also available in streaming audio on the ''Ideas'' website, and via subscription to the ''Ideas'' podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/podcasts/|title=Ideas Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosts==
&lt;!-- I'm not happy with the approximate dates  here, but it makes more sense than not listing any hosts for the first years of the program --&gt;

The ImageNet Challenge uses a "trimmed" list of one thousand non-overlapping classes.&lt;ref name=ILJVRC-2015/&gt;

A dramatic 2012 breakthrough in solving the ImageNet Challenge is widely considered to be the beginning of the [[deep learning]] revolution of the 2010s: "Suddenly people started to pay attention, not just within the AI community but across the technology industry as a whole."&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Machines 'beat humans' for a growing number of tasks|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4cc048f6-d5f4-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Financial Times|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dataset==
ImageNet [[crowdsources]] its annotation process. Image-level annotations indicate the presence or absence of an object class in an image, such as "there are tigers in this image" or "there are no tigers in this image". Object-level annotations provide a bounding box around the (visible part of the) indicated object. ImageNet uses a variant of the broad [[WordNet]] schema to categorize objects, augmented with 120 categories of [[dog breeds]] to showcase fine-grained classification.&lt;ref name=ILJVRC-2015&gt;Olga Russakovsky*, Jia Deng*, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, [[Andrej Karpathy]], Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg and Li Fei-Fei. (* = equal contribution) ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. IJCV, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; One downside of WordNet use is the categories may be more "elevated" than would be optimal for ImageNet: "Most people are more interested in Lady Gaga or the iPod Mini than in this rare kind of [[diplodocus]]." In 2012 ImageNet was the world's largest academic user of [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]]. The average worker identified 50 images per minute.&lt;ref name="nytimes 2012"/&gt;

==ImageNet Challenge==
Since 2010, the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a competition where research teams evaluate their algorithms on the given data set, and compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks. The ILSVRC aims to "follow in the footsteps" of the smaller-scale PASCAL VOC challenge, established in 2005, which contained only about 20,000 images and twenty object classes.&lt;ref name=ILJVRC-2015 /&gt; The ILSVRC uses a "trimmed" list of only 1000 image categories or "classes", including 90 of the 120 dog breeds classified by the full ImageNet schema.&lt;ref name=ILJVRC-2015/&gt; The 2010s saw dramatic progress in image processing. Around 2011, a good ILSVRC classification error rate was 25%. In 2012, a [[Deep learning#Convolutional neural networks|deep convolutional neural net]] achieved 16%; in the next couple of years, error rates fell to a few percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robbins|first1=Martin|title=Does an AI need to make love to Rembrandt's girlfriend to make art?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/06/does-an-ai-need-to-make-love-to-rembrandts-girlfriend-to-make-art|accessdate=22 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 2012 breakthrough "combined pieces that were all there before", the dramatic quantitative improvement marked the start of an industry-wide artificial intelligence boom.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; By 2015, researchers reported that software exceeded human ability at the narrow ILSVRC tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=A Learning Advance in Artificial Intelligence Rivals Human Abilities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/science/an-advance-in-artificial-intelligence-rivals-human-vision-abilities.html|accessdate=22 June 2016|work=The New York Times|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as one of the challenge's organizers, Olga Russakovsky, pointed out in 2015, the programs only have to identify images as belonging to one of a thousand categories; humans can recognize a larger number of categories, and also (unlike the programs) can judge the context of an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aron|first1=Jacob|title=Forget the Turing test – there are better ways of judging AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28206-forget-the-turing-test-there-are-better-ways-of-judging-ai/|accessdate=22 June 2016|work=New Scientist|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, over fifty institutions participated in the ILSVRC.&lt;ref name=ILJVRC-2015 /&gt; In 2015, [[Baidu]] scientists were banned for a year for using different accounts to greatly exceed the specified limit of two submissions per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=Computer Scientists Are Astir After Baidu Team Is Barred From A.I.

In 2017, 29 of 38 competing teams got less than 5% wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gershgorn|first1=Dave|title=The Quartz guide to artificial intelligence: What is it, why is it important, and should we be afraid?|url=https://qz.com/1046350/the-quartz-guide-to-artificial-intelligence-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-and-should-we-be-afraid/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Quartz|date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 ImageNet stated it would roll out a new, much more difficult, challenge in 2018 that involves classifying 3D objects using natural language. Because creating 3D data is more costly than annotating a pre-existing 2D image, the dataset is expected to be smaller. The applications of progress in this area would range from robotic navigation to [[augmented reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New computer vision challenge wants to teach robots to see in 3D|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127131-new-computer-vision-challenge-wants-to-teach-robots-to-see-in-3d/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New Scientist|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-competition results ===
Around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and COCO. According to Google, NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google AI creates its own ‘child’ bot|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-child-ai-bot-nasnet-automl-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-a8093201.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=The Independent|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14573">The '''International History Olympiad''' is a competition for top history students from around the world which debuted in 2015. The International History Olympiad was founded and is overseen by [[International Academic Competitions]] (IAC), though prior participation in IAC events (such as the [[National History Bee and Bowl]] or [[International History Bee and Bowl]]), is not required for students to attend the Olympiad. The qualification process, events, and awards structure at the International History Olympiad are markedly different from the [[International Science Olympiads]]. The International History Olympiad is open to students age 12-19 as long as they have not completed a year of university (from 2020 onwards; prior to 2020, students who had finished just one year of university and had qualified could attend) and have qualified. Students compete in three separate age ranges: Varsity, Junior Varsity, and Middle School, as is the case at other IHBB events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International History Olympiad|url = http://www.historyolympiad.com|website = www.historyolympiad.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International History Olympiad is sponsored by publisher [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], which helps cover travel costs and registration fees for participants who perform well in Olympiad qualification events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sponsors : International History Olympiad|url = http://www.historyolympiad.com/about/sponsors/|website = www.historyolympiad.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in 2018, a [[geography]] equivalent of the International History Olympiad took place in conjunction with the Olympiad: The [[International Geography Bee]] World Championships.

== Qualification ==
Students typically qualify for the Olympiad either by finishing in the top half of a regional or championship level tournament in either the International History Bee or the International History Bowl. US students must either win a [[National History Bee and Bowl]] regional bee or bowl or finish in the top half in either at the National Championships. Students who finish among the top students at the US National Championships or IHBB Divisional Championships may be awarded discounted or free entry, and/or travel stipends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benji Chiu Wins Silver Medal at International History Bee|url = http://blog.oregonlive.com/my-beaverton/2015/07/benji_chiu_wins_silver_medal_a.html|website = OregonLive.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who live over 400 kilometers from the nearest History Bee or Bowl tournaments or who could not attend due to extenuating circumstances may qualify by taking a specific exam administered by a teacher at their school. Qualification is valid for both the current academic year and the following (e.g. a student who qualifies in November 2015 could attend all Olympiads through the summer of 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Qualify? : International History Olympiad|url = http://www.historyolympiad.com/how-to-qualify/|website = www.historyolympiad.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no limit to the number of students from any one country or US state who can attend the International History Olympiad.

== Events ==
The majority of the competition events at the International History Olympiad follow a quiz bowl style format (utilizing a [[lock-out device]] buzzer system) with students competing individually. Students answer comprehensive, paragraph-length questions about specific topics in history, depending on the type of competition (e.g. Ancient History Bee, Art History Bee, etc.).

Two of the buzzer-based competitions, the International History Bee World Championships, and the International History Bowl World Championships, do not focus on specific aspects of history, but are meant to be comprehensive. The Bowl World Championships feature students on teams (usually from the same US state or country) rather than from the same school, as is the case at other IHBB tournaments.

Other competitions at the Olympiad include a research competition, various types of exams, games, and simulations of historical events (similar to [[Model UN]] historical crisis committees). The Olympiad also features a number of guest speakers, field trips, medals ceremonies for each event (complete with flags and national/state anthems), and opening and closing ceremonies.

Three events (the International History Bee World Championships, the Written Exam, and the Battery Exam) combine to form the official Olympiad championship. Students are ranked in order of their performance on these three competitions; the students with the combined best ranks are the official Olympiad champions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyolympiad.com/iho2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliation and medals ==
All students at the International History Olympiad compete for a US state (if they attend school in the USA or are an American citizen) or for their country of citizenship or residence. Students who would be eligible to compete for two affiliations must select one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fil-Am teen reaps 9 medals for PH at Int’l History Olympiad|url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/126428/fil-am-teen-reaps-9-medals-for-ph-at-intl-history-olympiad|website = globalnation.inquirer.net|access-date = 2016-02-07|first = INQUIRER.net U.S.|last = Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medals are awarded solely to the top three competitors in each event, but they are awarded for every event. In this way, the Olympiad more closely approximates the [[Olympics]] than the International Science Olympiads. A medals table is maintained as well - the ranking is first done by total number of golds, then total number of silvers, then total number of bronzes. 
Students are also assigned to teams for the team events at the Olympiad based on a number of factors, though every effort is made to keep students from the same country or state together. Teams consist of either 2 or 3 students. For team events, if a "mixed" team wins a medal, the medals are credited fractionally on the medals table depending on how many students from a state or country were on the team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyolympiad.com/iho2015/medals.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Olympiads ==
After 2016, the Olympiad became a biennial model; Olympiads thus occur in even-numbered years. The location of the 2020 International History Olympiad has yet to be determined, though it will take place in July 2020 and will once again be held in conjunction with the [[International Geography Bee]] World Championships.

== International History Bowl World Champions ==
One of the marquis events at the International History Olympiad is the International History Bowl World Championships. In contrast with all other International History Bowl events, where students compete on teams representing their schools, at the Olympiad, students compete on their designated Olympiad-specific teams. Also, while teams at other International History Bowl events typically feature four students playing at once, and permit teams of 1-6 students (at regionals) and 1-unlimited students (at Championships), the Olympiad features only teams of either 2 or 3 students. Wherever possible, teams consist exclusively of students in an age division from one US state or country. However, if only one student registers for the Olympiad from a particular affiliation, then that student will be paired with 1 or 2 other students from other affiliations. For a full list of European, Asian, and Canadian International History Bowl champions, see the [[International History Bee and Bowl]] page.

'''Joseph Pancoast''' (November 23, 1805 &amp;ndash; March 6, 1882) was an American surgeon.  His name is [[eponym]]ic to the practice of surgery, in general, and plastic surgery, in particular.

Pancoast was responsible for many seminal advancements in surgery that he described, and were depicted graphically, in numerous scholarly articles and books.  His greatest work, ''A Treatise on Operative Surgery'', was published in 1844.  He was also famous for his lectures and clinics in anatomy and surgery.

Pancoast was born of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parentage at [[Springfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey]], the son of John Pancoast (1771 &amp;ndash; 1841) and Ann Abbott,&lt;ref&gt;Swarthmore College; Swarthmore, Pennsylvania; ''Intentions of Marriage and Certificates of Removal, 1685-1756''; Collection: ''Quaker Meeting Records''; Call Number: ''MR-PH-109''&lt;/ref&gt; his wife.  Joseph Pancoast married Rebecca Abbott.

In 1828, Pancoast was awarded a degree in medicine by the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. From 1839 to 1841, he was Chairman of the Department of Surgery at [[Jefferson Medical College]].  From 1841 until his resignation in 1874, Pancoast was Chairman of the Department of Anatomy at the same institution. He was succeeded by his son, [[William H. Pancoast|William Henry Pancoast]], who was also a renowned surgeon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">The '''Matriculation Certificate''' is a qualification awarded to students leaving the [[Education in Malta|secondary school system of Malta]] and intending to [[matriculation|matriculate]] into the [[University of Malta]].  The Matriculation Certificate examinations are equivalent to the British [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A Level]].

Students are required to sit for six subjects from various areas in one session of the examination. The choice of subjects includes a language, a humanities or a business subject, mathematics or a science subject, and any other two subjects. The sixth subject is [[Systems of Knowledge]], which is compulsory. Two of the subjects must be at Advanced level, three at Intermediate level and Systems of Knowledge, which is also rated as an Intermediate level subject.

The certificate was first offered in 1997, when it was awarded to 1309 candidates. In 2005 there were 2455 candidates.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In order for a student to be successfully awarded the Matriculation Certificate students must achieve both of following criteria:
* Achieve a pass in at least groups 1,2 and 3.
* Have a total of 44 points (using the below system)

Students must be awarded this certificate in order to be accepted into the University of Malta. In addition, some courses at the university also require specific subjects at specific grades. This is the case for courses such as [[engineering]], [[medicine]], science, and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="courses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/courses/|title=Find a Course - University of Malta|website=www.um.edu.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of subjects ==

Subjects are divided into 4 groups. Each group representing Languages, Humanities, Sciences and Practical/Technical subjects. A student must choose one of each of the first three groups, and another two subjects chosen from any of the groups.

# Maltese, Arabic, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, Russian, Spanish
# Economics, Geography, History, Marketing, Philosophy, Psychology, Religious Knowledge, Sociology, Classical Studies*
# Applied Mathematics (Mechanics), Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science*, Physics, Pure Mathematics
# Art, Computing, Engineering Drawing, Graphical Communication, Home Economics and Human Ecology, Information Technology, Music, Systems of Knowledge*

items marked * are offered at Intermediate Level only.

== Grading ==

Grades are given from A-F, with A being the best, and F indicating a Fail. Each grade obtained gives the candidates a number of points, which when added up can be used to give an overall grade.

 Advanced Level                                 Intermediate Level
 Grade A - 30 grade points                      Grade A - 10 grade points
 Grade B - 24 grade points                      Grade B - 8 grade points
 Grade C - 18 grade points                      Grade C - 6 grade points
 Grade D - 12 grade points                      Grade D - 4 grade points
 Grade E - 6 grade points                       Grade E - 2 grade points.

After adding up the points, the following may be used to calculate the overall grade:

 Grade A - 80 -100 grade points
 Grade B - 64 - 78 grade points
 Grade C - 44 - 62 grade points

Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Feran |url=http://www.columbusceo.com/content/stories/Dispatch/2013/10/mcgraw-hill.html |title=Textbook publisher McGraw-Hill writing digital future |work=Columbus CEO |date=October 24, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing [[adaptive learning]] systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users.

==Corporate history==
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when [[James H. McGraw]], co-founder of the company, purchased the ''American Journal of Railway Appliances''. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing ''The McGraw Publishing Company'' in 1899. His co-founder, [[John A. Hill]], had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, ''The Hill Publishing Company''.

In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into ''The McGraw-Hill Book Company''. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into ''The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc''.&lt;ref name="mcgraw-history0"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Us: Corporate History: The Foundation | url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/aboutus/history.shtml | accessdate=May 26, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505102210/http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/aboutus/history.shtml | archivedate=May 5, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.&lt;ref name="TJR"&gt;{{cite news|title=McGraw Hill Buying The Economy Company|last=Tipton|first=David|date=July 3, 1986|work=The Journal Record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, McGraw Hill closed its trade book division.

McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became ''The McGraw-Hill Companies'' in 1995, as part of a corporate identity [[rebranding]].&lt;ref name="mcgraw-history3"&gt;{{cite web| title=About Us: Corporate History: The Information Age | url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/aboutus/history_information.shtml | accessdate=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2011}}

In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, [[GradeGuru]].com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.

On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to [[Apollo Global Management]] for $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/mcgraw-hill-to-sell-education-unit-to-apollo-for-2-5-billion/ "McGraw-Hill to Sell Education Unit to Apollo for $2.5 Billion"], ''New York Times'', November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://investor.spglobal.com/file/Index?KeyFile=16399301 |title=The McGraw-Hill Companies completes sale of McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo |publisher=McGraw Hill Companies |date=22 March 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In 1980, McGraw-Hill Education paid the African American writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin a $200,000 advance for his unfinished book ''Remember This House'', a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;ref name=mcgrawhill&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/19/books/mcgraw-hill-drops-baldwin-suit.html "McGraw-Hill Drops Baldwin Suit"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, the company sued his estate to recover the advance they had paid him for the unfinished book. The lawsuit was dropped by the company in 1990, citing a desire not to cause distress to Baldwin's family. 

In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]] as "[[laborer|workers]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4060687/mcgraw-hill-slavery-trade-textbook/ |title=Textbook Company to Update Description of Slaves as ‘Workers’ After Criticism |last1=Basu |first1=Tanya |date=October 4, 2015 |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html |title=Publisher Promises Revisions After Textbook Refers to African Slaves as ‘Workers’ |last1=Hauser |first1=Christine |date=October 5, 2015 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the controversy began in [[Houston]], it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the [[Texas Education Agency#Curriculum_controversies|Texas Education Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/04/living/mcgraw-hill-slavery-textbook-mom-complaint-feat/ |title=McGraw-Hill to rewrite textbook after mom's complaint |last1=Mcafee |first1=Melonyce |date=October 4, 2015 |publisher=''[[CNN]]'' |access-date=October 5, 2015 |quote="Texas has been a battleground in the fight over changes to textbooks that some say concede too much ground to conservative viewpoints on subjects such as climate change, religious liberty and slavery."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5453">'''[[NGO]] involvement in Guatemala''' includes the following.

==Guatemalan Association for Sexual Education==
The Guatemalan Association for Sexual Education (AGES), with backing from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), has set into motion several programs tailored to both improve the quality of the education, and the amount of people getting educated. To achieve this, it was necessary to have a mix of activities that sought to “balance broad systemic improvements with specific classroom support, and institutionalisation of project activities into existing organizational units”.&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;[Stromquist, N. (1999), "Improving Girls Education in Guatemala", Centre for Development, Information and Evaluation USAID, July 1999, Washington DC.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two programs implemented by AGES were particularly successful in achieving these goals.&lt;ref name=sm2&gt;[Mariana Cifuentes Montoya. (2004) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001466/146637e.pdf Good practice and quality education: Three NGOs initiatives in Latin America] pp. 3–6 Retrieved 22 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eduque a la Niña (Educate the Girl)==

Traditional [[gender role]]s are still prevalent in Guatemala and this has had a negative impact on the education levels of women. Women are tasked with domestic chores and are made to work on agricultural land such that there is no perceived need for educated women.&lt;ref name=sm3&gt;[Psacharopoulos, George, and Harry A. Patrinos, eds. (1994) [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/FinalExecutiveSummary_Eng_May05.pdf . Indigenous People and Poverty in Latin America: An Empirical Analysis] Washington, DC: World Bank. Retrieved 22 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that Guatemala has one of the lowest literacy rate in Latin America with 43 percent of all women over 15 are illiterate, compared with 28 percent of all men.&lt;ref name=sm1 /&gt;

The implementation of Eduque a la Niña was to address the pressing issue of basic education for girls and inculcate in parents the importance of girls’ education. AGES funded students with a $4.30-per-month scholarship, developed close parent teacher relationship to monitor the progress of the child and offered education materials specific to girls.&lt;ref name=sm2 /&gt; These schemes were put in place in hope that girls will be motivated to learn and parents would be supportive of their academic endeavours.

The schemes were well received and the provisions of scholarships were proven to be effective in encouraging girls to advance to the second grade.&lt;ref name=sm5&gt;[Liang. X. (1996)] [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Guatemala_girls_scholarship_case.pdf  Guantemala: Eduque a la Nina: Girls’ Scholarship.] Human Development Department, World Bank. p. 16 Retrieved 22 February 2012 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nueva Escuela Unitaria (NEU)==

The NEU was based on the Colombian’s Escuela Nueva model.&lt;ref name=sm6&gt;[http://www.schoolchains.org/en/school/escuela-nueva-activa-colombia] Retrieved 22 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; NEU schools are multi-grade schools serving rural indigenous communities. These schools use flexible individual and group study and active participation to increase the quality of education. It moved teachers away from traditional instructional teaching methods and introduced the use of small groups in the classroom. This innovation permitted students, in particular girls, to participate more actively in the classroom and have their experiences and knowledge recognised. Teachers from schools in close proximity are also required to meet regularly to "train, support and adapt learning materials".&lt;ref name=sm7&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/94829/Implementing Escuela Nueva in Guatemala (Anglais).pdf] Retrieved 22 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEU schools were evaluated in series of studies by Chesterfield and Rubio and by Baessa, as part of the Improving Educational Quality (IEQ) Project.&lt;ref name=sm8&gt;[Martha E. Mantilla with Yetilú de Baessa and Ray Chesterfield. (1997) [http://www.ieq.org/pdf/PolicyPracticeResearch.pdf Policy, Practice, Research, Dissemination/Dialogue spirals in improving educational quality] pp. 74–94 Retrieved 22 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that NEU schools retained significantly more students. The students were also able to achieve at a higher level in mathematics and reading. The active pedagogy in NEU schools contributed to emotional growth, participatory behavior, and group work. NEU teachers had greater confidence and capabilities to work in multigrade classrooms and used small group instruction. Overall parental satisfaction was higher in NEU schools citing their children’s ability to read better and behave better at home.&lt;ref name=sm2 /&gt;

One drawback of this program that has been noted is that the costs per NEU student is 58% higher than costs per student in standard schools.  However, the higher relative costs of the NEU can be seen as reasonable due to the small percentage of national budget directed to primary schools in Guatemala. Furthermore, the improved quality of education in NEU schools led to reduced repetition and dropout rates, resulting in a 15% drop in total costs per student to complete the primary cycle.&lt;ref name=sm2 /&gt;

'''Northwestern International University''' was one of the first colleges to offer self-directed online programs, which were based on review of prior-earned college credits, professional life-experiences, practical knowledge, research, portfolio work, and the passage of [[comprehensive examinations]] *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).  N.I.U. was a member of the Long Distance Learning Council *Cite (Long Distance Learning Council Catalog).  Their admissions process consisted of the initial registration process, student selection, and the review of student work and experience.  Students had to show proof of passing content specific exams before being considered for school admission.  They were also required to pass comprehensive exams at the completion of their respective program.  Furthermore, students were expected to complete a Practicum Learning Portfolio Log.  The time-requirement for portfolio hours varied by subject matter.  Lastly, students had to successfully complete and present research, before N.I.U. would issue their degree *Cite(Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).
          
Northwestern International University offered a [[Distance education|long-distance]], blended program that allowed students flexibility in working towards an advanced degree.  It enabled them to broaden their professional expertise, and stretch their academic knowledge all on the students own time, and in their own environment *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).
 
==Mission statement== 
Northwestern International University was committed to developing the potential of each of its students.  It provided the opportunity for academic excellence and professional growth.  The university created a climate in which all members of the community could freely think, write, research, analyze, share, and criticize *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog).  It was committed to extending university resources to the entire student body.  According to their Registration Catalog, the Mission of N.I.U. was to:

#Develop the skills essential to effective learning. 
#Apply critical thought to decisions in all areas of life. 
#Exercise responsibility in the local, national, and world community. 
#Access, select, and prepare students for a career. 
#Acquire attitudes and understanding necessary for effective human relationships. 
#Complete degree programs off-campus at a time and site convenient to adult learners.

Based on this model, the program and experience offered high quality content and flexibility.  This enabled students to tailor their academic studies and [[coursework]] to fit in with the rest of their schedule *Cite (Northwestern International University Registration Catalog). Northwestern International University truly was an innovative educational and training organization.  At the time, its quality set it apart from others in adult long-distance/self-directed/online learning.  It was truly unique and a pioneer in its field.
 
N.I.U. was initially accredited by the Euro-American Accreditation Agency.  This organization (and its trustees) ensured the highest possible standards of academic excellence in curriculum design and operational policies in all university programs *Cite (Euro-American Accreditation Agency).

==Decline and Closure==
Unfortunately, the academic programs of Northwestern began to decline in 2007. They were no longer considered rigorous, and [[course credit|academic credit]] was being given erroneously, at best (solely based on Life Experience) *Cite (Google).  Furthermore, in 2007, the university’s accreditation had been cancelled.  In 2008, the Accreditation Agency itself had been disbanded.  After the university reconfigured itself, students also “lost” credit for some prior coursework.  N.I.U. was officially closed in 2009 *Cite (Consumer Protection).  Many states and nations do not accept their coursework, credit, and degrees if obtained after 2007 *Cite (Department of Education).  Those that were earned and granted (prior to 2007) are often accepted.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Olivier Zahm in 1979.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Zahm pictured in [[1979]] in [[Paris]]]]
Olivier Zahm was born and raised in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/olivier-zahm|title=Olivier Zahmis One of the 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by [[Charlotte Perriand]] and [[Jean Prouvé]], located at [[:fr:Résidence_universitaire_Jean-Zay|Résidence Universitaire Jean-Zay]] in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in [[May 1968]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against [[capitalism]], [[consumerism]], [[American imperialism]], and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices.  He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood.  He told The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2010 that he, “remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - who he labeled hippies. It was the ''1970s'', the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to [[free love]]'','' [[Naturism|nudism]] and [[Polyamory|polyamourous]] relationships. "My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Zahm’s love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. “We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,” he says. “It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He studied [[Philosophy|philosophy,]] [[history]],  [[semiotics]] and [[literature]] at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Olivier-Zahm-l-anar-chic-purple-Fashion-156808|title=Olivier Zahm, l’anar chic|last=Match|first=Paris|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Career ==
Before entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/2/|title=Purple Prose , #2|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/about/|title=Purple Prose  magazine on Magpile|website=magpile.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847830206/|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex - Rizzoli New York|work=Rizzoli New York|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2008-issue-10/purple-anthology/|title=Purple Anthology - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our own".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Purple Anthology|last=Zahm|first=Olivier|last2=Fleiss|first2=Elein|publisher=Rizzoli|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8478-3020-6|location=New York City|pages=introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Anthology-Prose-Fashion-Architecture/dp/0847830209|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex|date=2008-05-27|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=9780847830206|editor-last=Zahm|editor-first=Olivier|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Fleiss|editor-first2=Elein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Art critic and curator (1985–1994) ===
During the beginning of the 80’s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of “being everywhere and on the move”, following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape.  Zahm’s gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time [[Artforum|Art Forum]], Art Flash, [[Texte zur Kunst|Texte Zur Kunst]] and [[Art press|Art Presse]] and introduced a then unknown [[Jeff Koons]], [[Martin Kippenberger]], and [[Larry Clark]] to the European art world.   He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told [[I-D|I-D magazine]] in 2010: 
[[File:Jan Van Osst, Sans titre, 1993.jpg|thumb|Jan Van Osst, Sans Titre, 1993 at L'Hiver De L'amour in [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville Paris]] curated by Zahm]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be part of an intellectual world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1989, while working at [[Artforum]],  Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, they curated “The Winter of Love,”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589&lt;/ref&gt; a hit show for the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Museum of Modern Art in Paris]] that they later took to [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589|title=The Winter of Love (L'Hiver de l'Amour) {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/art-press/20170521/282626032622730|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of  2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm: Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/fr/article/3kbd8v/sans-dieu-ni-maitres-petite-lecon-davant-gardisme-par-olivier-zahm|title=sans dieu ni maitre, petite leçon d'avant-gardisme par olivier zahm|date=2017-04-25|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;The book is a collection of Zahm’s most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The [[anthology]] tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant-garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm:  Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/Une-avant-garde-sans-Olivier-Zahm/dp/2840665441|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|last=recherche|first=résultats de|last2=Grau|first2=Donatien|date=2017-03-01|publisher=Les Presses du réel|isbn=9782840665441|location=Dijon; Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=18&amp;id_b=2748|title=Olivier Zahm - Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|website=jrp-ringier|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livre.fnac.com/a10494503/Olivier-Zahm-Une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde Essai sur l'art - broché - Olivier Zahm - Achat Livre {{!}} fnac|website=livre.fnac.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/olivier-zahms-new-book-une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde-co-edited-with-donatien-grau-is-available-now-to-pre-order/|title=Olivier Zahm's new book "Une avant-garde sans avant-garde" co-edited with Donatien Grau is available now to pre-order! - purple DIARY|date=2017-02-23|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early day's of ''Purple'' (1992–2004) ====

Zahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art.  In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ravelinmagazine.com/posts/les-chroniques-purple/|title=Les Chroniques Purple - Ravelin Magazine|date=2014-08-13|work=Ravelin Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/PURPLE-PROSE-MAGAZINE-ISSUE-1-1992-OLIVIER-ZAHM-ELEIN-FLEISS-RARE-/121033472335|title=PURPLE PROSE MAGAZINE ISSUE #1 1992 OLIVIER ZAHM, ELEIN FLEISS *RARE*  {{!}} eBay|website=eBay|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-colour-purple-1249204.html|title=The colour purple|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/creative-class/olivier-zahms-cocktail-of-intellect-sex-and-the-seventies|title=Olivier Zahm’s Cocktail of Intellect, Sex and the Seventies|date=2015-05-27|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. [[Dike Blair]] an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagent, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/interview-olivier-zahm-on-the-purple-25th-anniversary.html|title=A French Fashion Editor on the Difference Between Paris, New York, and L.A.|last=Swanson|first=Carl|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/1/|title=Purple Prose , #1|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adaweb.walkerart.org/purple/info.html|title=Purple Prose|website=adaweb.walkerart.org|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].  From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like [[Richard Avedon]]’s photography for [[Versace]], for example.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/fine-print-the-purple-anthology/?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=2D16E914473B5E10578FBC9B4FEF8E2C&amp;gwt=pay|title=Fine Print {{!}} 'The Purple Anthology'|last=Hruska|first=Jordan|work=T Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, [[video art]], [[Fluxus]], and the conceptual and minimalist [[avant-garde]]. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by [[Martin Margiela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2007-issue-7/retrospective-maison-martin-margiela/|title=Retrospective Maison Martin Margiela - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comme des Garçons|Comme des Garçsons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2012-issue-18/rei-kawakubo/|title=Rei Kawakubo - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the return of subtle political art, with that of [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez- Torres]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and [[Philippe Parreno]], among others; photography of [[Juergen Teller]]; and [[Harmony Korine]] and [[Larry Clark]]’s independent filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/harmony-korine/|title=Harmony Korine - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/larry-clark/|title=Larry Clark - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media now generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital amnesia, I think that means something&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/purple-25th-anniversary-issue-is-out-now/|title=PURPLE 25TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE IS OUT NOW! - purple DIARY|date=2017-09-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/purples-l-a-times-1202780271/|title=Purple’s L.A.

Zahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005.  Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple’s 25th Anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a photographer when you were friends with [[Helmut Newton]] because, me, I have [[Juergen Teller]] in my generation and I haven’t been able to do photography since I’ve known him, because he’s the best.” And he said: “Olivier, shut up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], do you think he was a good photographer? He always had a camera on him. Do like Warhol, do like me: Don’t let a day go by without taking a picture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2009, he began documenting his late-night partying escapades in high-contrast black-and-white photographs which appeared on Purple Diary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/fashion-s-naughtiest-photographer-olivier-zahm|title=Fashion’s Naughtiest Photographer, Olivier Zahm|last=Jones|first=Justin|date=2014-09-09|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a notorious photo blog that would become the seed for a full Purple website.

Martins was a [[principal dancer]] with the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] and with the [[New York City Ballet]], where he joined [[George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins]], and [[John Taras]] as [[Ballet master|balletmaster]] in 1981. He retired from dancing in 1983, having achieved the rank of [[danseur noble]], becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief with Robbins. From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet. 

In December 2017, Martins took a leave of absence from the New York City Ballet following an allegation of sexual misconduct made against him.&lt;ref name=Wingenroth&gt;{{Cite news|author= Lauren Wingenroth|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/peter-martins-leave-absence-accusations-2515881048.html|date=December 8, 2017|title=Peter Martins Is Taking A Leave of Absence As More Accusations Surface|work=Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PogrebinLeave"&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/arts/dance/city-ballets-peter-martins-takes-leave-of-absence-after-misconduct-accusation.html City Ballet's Peter Martins Takes Leave of Absence After Misconduct Accusation], ''New York Times'' (December 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Five City Ballet dancers later told the ''New York Times'' that Martins had verbally or physical abused them; Martins denied engaging in any misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/arts/dance/peter-martins-ballet-new-york-city-physical-abuse.html Five Dancers Accuse City Ballet’s Peter Martins of Physical Abuse], ''New York Times'' (December 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pogrebin2018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/arts/dance/peter-martins-resigns-ballet.html|title=Peter Martins Retires From New York City Ballet After Misconduct Allegations|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=January 1, 2018|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martins retired from the City Ballet on January 1, 2018.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin2018"/&gt; A subsequent joint inquiry commissioned by the City Ballet and its School of American Ballet "did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence" made against Martins.&lt;ref name="PogrebinInquiry"&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/arts/dance/peter-martins-ballet-investigation.html Abuse Accusations Against Peter Martins Are Not Corroborated, Inquiry Says], ''New York Times'' (February 15, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Martins was born and raised in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Mary Ellen Snodgrass (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNvaCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Peter+Martins%22+copenhagen+born&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2WlyKhXrGg&amp;sig=5yVGw8_TDfcMGNZE728v96zhmng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiM7CorrYAhWElOAKHcMfBmcQ6AEIpwEwGg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peter%20Martins%22%20copenhagen%20born&amp;f=false ''The Encyclopedia of World Ballet,''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Børge Martins, an engineer, and Tove Christa Ornberg, a pianist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; His maternal aunt and uncle, Leif and Elna Ornberg, members of the Royal Danish Ballet, started teaching him ballroom combinations when he was five years of age; when he applied to ballet school, however, he was the subject of discrimination because his aunt and uncle had been [[Nazi sympathizer]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; It was his older sisters who originally tried-out for the Royal Ballet of Denmark at the age of seven. When they did, he was sitting in the waiting room reading a Donald Duck comic book. They were denied admittance. The asked Peter to "point his foot". He did especially well and was admitted.

==Career==

Martins began his ballet training in 1953 with the [[Royal Danish Ballet]]. He joined the [[corps de ballet]] in 1965, and was promoted to [[Soloist (ballet)|soloist]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Martins|title=Peter Martins {{!}} Danish dancer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Martins left Denmark in 1970 and became a [[principal dancer]] with the New York City Ballet (NYCB), though he had been performing as a guest artist since 1967.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5507420&amp;privcapId=5507480&amp;previousCapId=5507480&amp;previousTitle=New%20York%20City%20Ballet,%20Inc.|title=Peter Martins: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martins danced a wide variety of roles, but is most known for the titular role in ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' and the Cavalier in Balanchine's ''[[The Nutcracker|Nutcracker]]''. He danced frequently with [[Suzanne Farrell]]. However, he terminated her employment with the NYCB in 1993; she went on to found her own company, which disbanded in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/04/arts/city-ballet-breaks-off-its-long-relationship-with-suzanne-farrell.html|title=City Ballet Breaks Off Its Long Relationship With Suzanne Farrell|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|date=1993-08-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/suzanne-farrell-ballet-to-disband-in-2017/2016/09/21/c9877a2e-8025-11e6-b002-307601806392_story.html|title=Suzanne Farrell Ballet to disband in 2017|last=Kaufman|first=Sarah L.|date=2016-09-21|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martins retired from dancing in 1983, becoming Co-Ballet Master-In-Chief alongside Jerome Robbins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/arts/dance-view-two-special-dancers-leave-the-stage.html|title=Dance View; Two Special Dancers Leave the Stage|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=1983-12-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed the job of sole Balletmaster-in-Chief in 1990. Martins was Balanchine's personal choice of successor. However, early in his career as balletmaster, Martins faced criticism for perceived deviations from Balanchine's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-29/entertainment/ca-5680_1_city-ballet|title=Dance:  An Identity Crisis at the New York City Ballet|last=Bernheimer|first=Martin|date=1988-05-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martins also served as the artistic director and chairman of faculty of the [[School of American Ballet]], the training division of the NYCB and the venue through which it receives most of its dancers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; From 1990 until January 2018, he was solely responsible for artistic leadership of City Ballet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sab.org/school/faculty/peter_martins_artistic_directorchairman_of_faculty.php|title=Peter Martins, Artistic Director/Chairman of Faculty {{!}} The School of American Ballet|website=sab.org|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of the 1991 documentary ''Peter Martins: A Dancer''.

===Allegations of sexual assault===
In December 2017, an investigation was announced by New York City Ballet into accusations by dancers within the company of [[Assault|physical]] and [[sexual assault]] by Martins, and using his power to obtain sexual favors, dating back to 1983.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/peter-martins-leave-absence-accusations-2515881048.html|title=Peter Martins Is Taking A Leave of Absence As More Accusations Surface|date=2017-12-08|work=dancemagazine|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his accusers, Wilhelmina Frankfurt, a former New York City Ballet ballerina and later a dance educator, said: "Am I a victim of Martins abuse? Yes. Was it sexual? Yes. Was it consensual? No [...] It was scary. One incident that occurred  [...] He [...] pulled me into his dressing room and, exposed himself to me. [And one incident is] so big I don’t think I can talk about it."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.salon.com/2018/01/08/peter-martins-sexual-misconduct-wilhelmina-frankfurt/&lt;/ref&gt;

Martins took a leave of absence that month from both the New York City Ballet and its School of the American Ballet, after the allegations came to light, and in January 2018 he retired.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Feldman (January 1, 2018).

==Personal life==

Martins had a longterm romantic relationship with [[Heather Watts]] during her career as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[http://www.wral.com/five-dancers-accuse-city-ballet-s-peter-martins-of-physical-abuse/17181967/?comment_order=forward Five dancers accuse city ballet’s peter martins of physical abuse :: WRAL.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Clifford (choreographer)|John Clifford]], a principal dancer and choreographer under [[George Balanchine]], recalled "I saw him pick her up and slam her into a cement wall."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; In ballerina [[Gelsey Kirkland]]'s book ''Dancing on My Grave'' (1986), she describes Martins dragging Watts up and down a flight of stairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancemagazine.com/peter-martins-leave-absence-accusations-2515881048.html Peter Martins Is Taking A Leave of Absence As More Accusations Surface - dancemagazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first married to Lisa La Cour, a ballerina he danced with at the Royal Ballet of Denmark. He had a child with her, Nilas. They met while they were both with the Royal Ballet of Denmark and after their divorce, he was a guest-artist with the New York City Ballet and eventually defected to America to dance with the latter company full-time. Nilas eventually followed his father to America, to New York City and to the New York City Ballet. 

In July 1992, Martins was arrested and held for five hours after his 28-year-old wife of seven months, New York City Ballet principal ballerina [[Darci Kistler]], phoned the police for help. His wife filed an affidavit accusing him of assaulting her, pushing and slapping her, and cutting and bruising her arms and legs and continuing to hit her after she fell under his attack.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ballet-chief-peter-martins-under-investigation-after-sexual-harassment-allegations/2017/12/04/a474eae6-d3a3-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html Ballet chief Peter Martins under investigation after sexual harassment allegations - The Washington Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; He was charged with third-degree [[assault]] (a misdemeanor).&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/07/22/Ballerina-drops-assault-charges-against-husband/8361711777600/ "Ballerina drops assault charges against husband,"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] UPI, July 22, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/22/nyregion/martins-ballet-master-held-on-charge-he-beat-his-wife.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 22, 1992|title=Martins, Ballet Master, Held On Charge He Beat His Wife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[https://pagesix.com/2007/02/11/ballet-legend-almost-got-boot/ "Ballet Legend Almost Got Boot" | Page Six,&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''New York Post'', February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kistler dropped the charges a few days later, saying she preferred to resolve the matter without the court's intervention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7EM-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peter+Martins%22+assault+wife&amp;dq=%22Peter+Martins%22+assault+wife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL-_Gkz7rYAhUpRN8KHb0-CMAQ6AEIPTAE ''Vogue''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Vol. 188, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; When she next performed in a ballet two days later, she reportedly wore heavy makeup to conceal bruises she had suffered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Several people who knew the two well claimed it wasn't the first time Martins had hit her.&lt;ref&gt;Scott J.

The site is one of many allowing academics to engage in [[Peer review#Postpublication reviews|post-publication peer review]], and has highlighted shortcomings in several high-profile papers, in some cases leading to [[retractions]] and to accusations of [[scientific fraud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=researcher admits mistakes in stem cell study|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/2013/05/27/researcher-admits-mistakes-in-stem-cell-study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2013-05/klonen-studie-fehler-mitalipov-reaktion|title=Zellbiologe gibt Fehler in Klonstudie zu|date=2013-05-23|author=Sven Stockrahm|author2=Lydia Klöckner|author3=Dagny Lüdemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stem cell cloner acknowledges errors in ground breaking paper|url=http://www.nature.com/news/stem-cell-cloner-acknowledges-errors-in-groundbreaking-paper-1.13060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stapgate shows Japan must get back to basics in science|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U2skY8fTZss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel George Soal''' (1889–1975) — known as '''S.G. Soal''' — was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[parapsychologist]]. He was charged with [[Scientific misconduct|fraudulent production of data]] in his work in parapsychology.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. p. 319. {{ISBN|978-0816033515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Soal graduated with first class honours in mathematics from [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] (then East London College) in 1910. After service in [[World War I]], in which he suffered shelling at the [[Battle of the Somme]], he lectured in mathematics at Oxford in the Army School of Education, before returning as a lecturer to Queen Mary College, University of London.&lt;ref&gt;Goldney, K. M. (1975, July–August). S.G. Soal: A personal tribute. ''Parapsychology Review'', 21-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he was awarded the D.Sc. from Queen Mary College, where he continued to lecture in mathematics until his retirement in 1954. In 1947, he presented the Ninth Myers Memorial Lecture to the [[Society for Psychical Research]], largely on the topic of the card-guessing experiments he had been recently conducting. He served as president of the Society for the years 1950-1952. He was a Fulbright Scholar in 1951, for which he journeyed to the USA to work with [[Joseph Gaither Pratt|J. G. Pratt]] at [[Duke University]]. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship in Psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London for the years 1954-1958. Thereafter, he moved permanently to [[Caernarvonshire]], Wales, where he had routinely holidayed for each year over the past few decades, and where he died in 1975.

===Early qualitative studies===
During this time, Soal demonstrated a personal as well as scientific interest in psychical research, becoming a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in October 1922. He was partly moved to make his first parapsychological studies following the death of one of his brothers in the [[First World War]]. Like many of the bereaved at the time, he made enquiries of mediums concerning communication with the departed; but conducted his observations with a scientific approach. His observations surprised conventional understanding even within psychical research. Most especially, he reported a case of apparently precognitive telepathy of a situation yet to occur for a long-forgotten, but still living, friend of his, Gordon Davis.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1925). A report of some communications received through Mrs. Blanche Cooper. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', ''35'', 471-594.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested, in line with earlier speculations, that the statements of mediums had nothing to do with "spirits of the departed," but only knowledge gained - by telepathy, if need be - from the sitters themselves. What was particularly surprising was that this information was yet to be learned by Soal himself. 

Soal himself practised [[automatic writing]] at this time, and pseudonymously authored a much-discussed paper on the scripts he produced, which purported to be authored by the deceased [[Oscar Wilde]]. He later himself declaimed the evidentiality of these scripts, and considered that they were largely the product of [[cryptomnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1935). Spiritualism. In J. Franklyn (Ed.), ''Dictionary of the occult'' (pp. 213-268). London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Statistical studies===

Soal moved to a more statistical and controlled approach, firstly by conducting an experiment in which up to a few hundred persons participated at one time.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1932). Experiments in supernormal perception at a distance. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', ''40'', 165-362.&lt;/ref&gt; This involved Soal and a small group of agents enacting a scenario, playing with a certain object, reciting a poem, and so on, which the participants, situated across Great Britain and other countries, were required, at the same time, to attempt to imaginally perceive. The French psychical researcher [[Rene Warcollier]] contributed some trials to this research, via his pool of selected participants. While some striking correspondences were obtained, these did not hold up to Soal's statistical scrutiny, and the report of the research commenced with the note that the findings were "entirely negative".

Following popular and academic reports of [[extra-sensory perception]] by card-guessing, Soal again changed his research processes and commenced a series of card-guessing experiments in [[telepathy]], including trials canvassed over radio and via the literary magazine ''[[John O'London's Weekly]]''. From 1936-1941, he performed over 120,000 trials of card-guessing with 160 participants without ever being able to report a significant finding.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G., &amp;amp; Bateman, F. (1954). ''Modern experiments in telepathy''. London, UK: Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; In review, he scathingly offered the opinion that telepathy was a merely American phenomenon; he was described by the US researcher, [[J. B. Rhine]], as one of his most harsh and unfair critics.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G., &amp;amp; Bowden, H. T. (1959). ''The mind readers: Some recent experiments in telepathy''. London, UK: Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next however, upon the hypothesis of [[Whately Carington]], a fellow researcher within the [[Society for Psychical Research]], Soal was able to report a significant [[Displacement (parapsychology)|displacement effect]] in his data for two of his earlier participants.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1940). Fresh light on card guessing: Some new effects. ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', ''46'', 152-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Carington and Soal co-authored a paper on the effect, published in ''Nature'' in 1940. Soal thereupon sought to confirm these observations with new studies with these participants: [[Basil Shackleton]] (a celebrated London portrait photographer, later to become associated with the "Grape Cure" for cancer) and Gloria Stewart.

These studies, conducted in collaboration with [[K. M. Goldney]] and F. Bateman, were widely reviewed as among the most challenging proofs of [[precognition]] and [[telepathy]]. Not only were the significances of the studies - in terms of the correspondence between ESP guesses and random targets - extraordinary, the procedures appeared to allow no alternative hypothesis. There was also the testimony of 21 prominent observers who, individually, monitored Soal's work with Shackleton, that they were satisfied with the conditions, and could conceive of no means by which the results could be obtained by normal means other than ESP. Many leading academics, including [[C. D. Broad]]&lt;ref&gt;Broad, C. D. (1944). The experimental establishment of telepathic precognition. ''Philosophy'', ''19'', 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cyril Burt|Sir Cyril Burt]], were persuaded, largely or partly on the basis of these reports, to lend academic support to psi-related ideas and research.

Arguments against Soal's data have, however, been raised ever since their publication. These proposed "unconscious whispering" (from the experimenter to the ‘agent,’ and then from the ‘agent’ to the ‘percipient’); the inapplicability of probability theory to science (as offered by [[George Spencer-Brown]]&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Brown, G. (1953). Statistical significance in psychical research. ''Nature'', ''172'', 154-156.&lt;/ref&gt;); and collusion between the ‘agent’ to the ‘percipient’.&lt;ref&gt;Hansel, C. E. M. (1959). Experimental evidence for extra-sensory perception. ''Nature'', ''184'', 1515-1516.&lt;/ref&gt; Outright fraud was also advanced (by [[George R. Price]]) and prominently canvassed in the American journal ''Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Price, G. R. (1955). Science and the supernatural. ''Science'', ''122'', 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt; Soal attempted to rebut the critiques.&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1956). On "Science and the Supernatural". ''Science'', ''123'', 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1956). Some statistical aspects of ESP. In G. E. W. Wolstenholme &amp; E. C. P. Millar (Eds.), ''Extrasensory perception: A CIBA Foundation symposium'' (pp. 80-90). New York, NY, US: Citadel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G. (1960). ''Experimental evidence for extra-sensory perception''. ''Nature'', ''185'', 950-951.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soal, S. G., &amp; Bateman, F. (1954). ''Modern experiments in telepathy''. London, UK: Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wassermann, G. D. (1955). ''Some comments on methods and statements in parapsychology and other sciences''. ''British Journal for Philosophy of Science'', ''6'', 122-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, it was reported that Soal evidently appeared to reuse some target sequences from an earlier test in a later one, often reversing, omitting or inserting one or more digits into the sequence before reusing them.&lt;ref name="Markwick1978"/&gt; It was considered suspicious that a disproportionate number of "hits" occurred on the digits that appeared to interrupt some of the reused sequences. Betty Marwick discovered that Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets "all the experiments reported by Soal had thereby been discredited."&lt;ref name="Markwick1978"&gt;Markwick, B. (1978). ''The Soal-Goldney Experiments with Basil Shackleton: New Evidence of Data Manipulation''. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 56, 250-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansel 1989"&gt;Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. pp. 100-116. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For two of the 40 sessions with Shackleton, it was claimed that it was "virtually conclusive" that this practice amounted to fraud; and fraud in another six sessions was considered to be "suggestive only".&lt;ref&gt;Markwick, B. (1985). ''The Establishment of Data Manipulation in the Soal-Shackleton Experiments''. In Paul Kurtz (Ed.), ''A Skeptic’s Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 287-312. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soal was not able to replicate his earlier work while continuing to conduct telepathy experiments, at the University of London, after his retirement, from 1954 to 1958. During these years, however, he conducted a long series of apparently successful experiments with a pair of young brothers, as participants, in Northern Wales. This work was immediately and severely criticised on methodological grounds; simulations of the study suggesting that the boys, with their family, could have been successfully undetected in using a code in association with an ultrasonic whistle, perhaps blown by a secreted pump.

It was not until the 1970s, when Soal was already senile and no longer able to respond, that his data were finally deemed insupportable by his fellow parapsychologists. These concerned largely statistical challenges offered by members of the SPR on the basis of several novel analyses they conducted by computer searches of the data from the 1941-1943 study with Shackleton.

The psychologist [[C. E. M. Hansel]] has documented the fraud of Soal and the flaws in his experiments.&lt;ref name="Hansel 1989"/&gt;

==Mediumship==
Distinguished at this time for his contribution to studies of mediumship, Soal was the chosen author for a survey of "[[Spiritualism]]", in 55 pages, for the first 1935 publication of the ''Dictionary of the Occult''.

During 1921-1922 Soal carried out a series of séances with the medium Blanche Cooper who claimed to have contacted the spirit of a soldier Gordon Davis and revealed the [[house]] he had lived in.&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"&gt;Harris, Melvin. (1986). ''Investigating the Unexplained''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 137-144. {{ISBN|0-87975-367-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, his report about these séances was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. However, it was discovered that fraud was involved with the case. Davis was alive and Soal altered the records of the sittings after checking out the house.&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"/&gt; Researcher [[Melvin Harris]] noted that:

:Mr. Soal was a devious character. And it's clear that in the six weeks at his disposal he had plenty of chance to find out things about number 54. I've visited the house myself and noted that all Soal had to do was walk past the place, then ride past on the double-decker bus and record everything that could be spotted through the plain glass windows.&lt;ref name="Harris 1986"/&gt;

According to magician Bob Couttie, Soal's co-workers knew that he had fiddled the results but were kept quiet with threats of libel suits.&lt;ref&gt;Couttie, Bob.(1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. pp. 104-105. {{ISBN|978-0718826864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11222">The issue of '''school speech''' or '''curricular speech''' as it relates to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] has been the center of controversy and litigation since the mid-20th century. The First Amendment's guarantee of [[freedom of speech]] applies to students in the public schools. In the landmark decision ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] formally recognized that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.]]'', 393 U.S. at 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core principles of ''Tinker'' remain unaltered, but are tempered by several important decisions, including ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]], [[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]'', and ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]''.&lt;ref name="Bender"/&gt; Despite respect for the legitimate educational interests of school officials, the Supreme Court has not abandoned Tinker; it continues to recognize the basis precept of  ''Tinker'' that viewpoint-specific speech restrictions are an egregious violation of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name="Bender"/&gt; In ''[[Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia]]'', the Supreme Court declared: "Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional". ''Rosenberger'' held that denial of funds to a student organization on the sole basis that the funds were used to publish a religiously oriented student newspaper was an unconstitutional violation of the right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Accordingly, for other on-campus speech that is neither obscene, vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive under ''Fraser'' nor school-sponsored under ''Hazelwood'' nor advocating illegal drugs at a school-sponsored event under ''Frederick'', Tinker applies limiting the authority of schools to regulate the speech, whether on or off-campus, unless it would materially and substantially disrupt classwork and discipline in the school.

==''Tinker v. Des Moines''==
{{main|Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District}}
In ''Tinker'', several students were suspended for wearing black armbands that protested against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Bender"&gt;3-9 EDUCATION LAW § 9.04 (CHAPTER 9 Student Safety, Control and Discipline) -- Copyright 2008, Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc., a member of the LexisNexis Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bethel School District v. Fraser''==
{{main|Bethel School District v. Fraser}}
In ''Fraser'', a high school student was disciplined following his speech to a school assembly at which he nominated a fellow student for a student elective office. The speech contained sexual innuendos, but not obscenities. The Supreme Court found that school officials could discipline the student. In doing so, it recognized that "the process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order". Recognizing that one of the important purposes of public education is to inculcate the habits and manners of civility as valued conducive both to happiness and to the practice of self-government, the Supreme Court emphasized that "consciously or otherwise, teachers—and indeed the older students—demonstrate the appropriate form of civil discourse and political expression by their conduct and deportment in and out of class".&lt;ref&gt;''Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser'', 478 US 675, 92 LEd2d 549, 106 SCt 3159 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''Fraser'' standard, school officials look not merely to the reasonable risk of disruption—the ''Tinker'' standard—but would also balance the freedom of a student's speech rights against the school's interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior. Schools have discretion to curtail not only obscene speech, but speech that is vulgar, lewd, indecent, or plainly offensive. 

==''Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier''==

{{main|Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier}}
The Hazelwood School District case applies the principles set forth in Fraser to curricular matters. In ''Hazelwood'', the Supreme Court upheld a school's decision to censor  certain articles in the school newspaper which was produced as part of the school's journalism curriculum. Echoing ''Fraser'', the Supreme Court observed that "[a] school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with 'its basic educational mission'...even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school". School authorities and educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.''&lt;ref&gt;Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 US 260, 98 LEd2d 592, 108 SCt 562, (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;''

==''Morse v. Frederick''==

{{main|Morse v. Frederick}}
''Morse v. Frederick'' blends ''Fraser'' and ''Hazelwood'', applying them to a school-sanctioned event or activity.&lt;ref name="Bender"/&gt; While students were along a public street in front of school watching the [[Olympic flame|Olympic Torch Relay]] pass through, Frederick unfurled a banner bearing the phrase: "[[Bong|BONG]] {{sic|HiTS}} 4 JESUS". The banner was in plain view of other students. The high school principal seized the banner and suspended Frederick because the banner was perceived to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The Supreme Court held that a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. Not only was a school activity involved, but the banner's promotion of illegal drugs was contrary to the school's policy or mission to prevent student drug abuse.

==School-specific factors==

The right of free speech is not itself absolute: the Court has consistently upheld regulations as to time, place, and manner of speech, provided that they are "reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bates v. State Bar of Ariz.]]''; ''[[Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council]]''; ''[[Healy v. James]]'' (school case); ''[[Grayned v. City of Rockford]]''; ''[[Adderley v. Florida]]''; ''[[Cox v. Louisiana]]''; ''[[Kovacs v. Cooper]]''; ''[[Cox v. New Hampshire]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In applying this  ''reasonableness'' test to regulations limiting student expression, the Court has recognized that the age and maturity of students is an important factor to be considered.&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;1-9 Ohio School Law Guide § 9.74. Anderson's Ohio School Law Guide. CHAPTER 9: PUPILS. G. PUPIL REGULATION AND DISCIPLINE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bethel School Dist. 403 v. Fraser]]; [[Morse v. Frederick]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the school context, the United States Supreme Court has identified three major relevant considerations:&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt;
#The extent to which the student speech in question poses a substantial threat of disruption (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.]]'').
#Whether the speech is sexually vulgar or obscene (''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'').
#Whether the speech, if allowed as part of a school activity or function, would be contrary to the basic educational mission of the school (''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'').

Each of these considerations has given rise to a separate mode of analysis, and in ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'' the Court implied that any one of these may serve as an independent basis for restricting student speech.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt;

===Disruption===
The problem of disruption is perhaps the most fundamental issue addressed by the courts in student free speech cases.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt;

===Offensiveness===
The second major question addressed by the courts is closely related to, but nevertheless distinct from, the question of disruption. This is the question of speech which is offensive to prevailing community standards by reason of being vulgar, lewd, or indecent speech.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt; Courts have held that offensiveness is a question of whether speech is plainly offensive in terms of sexual content or implication, rather than simply expressing ideas and beliefs considered offensive by some or most students or members of the community. ''See Saxe v. State College Area School District''. In ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', the Supreme Court recognized the special responsibility of the public schools to inculcate moral values and to teach students the boundaries of socially acceptable behavior. It therefore permitted a public school to discipline a student for making sexually suggestive remarks in an address to a school assembly, even though the remarks were not ''obscene'' in the traditional sense.

The ability to regulate ''inappropriate'' speech has been found to be especially important in situations where the student speech may have the appearance of being sponsored or endorsed by the school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bethel'', the Court held that the offensiveness test does not apply to off-campus speech. 

===Impairing educational mission===

The third major area of concern addressed in student free speech cases is whether a particular instance of student speech may be viewed as impairing the school's ability to carry out its educational mission.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt; This concern arises where the speech in question occurs in connection with a school-sponsored or school-controlled activity but is inconsistent with a legitimate pedagogical concern. In such circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has found that student speech may be regulated. For example, in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]'', it held that a school may exercise control over the content of a student newspaper when it attempts to address issues of divorce and teenage pregnancy; in ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', it permitted a school to exercise control over the words displayed on a large banner at a school-sponsored event, when those words convey a message promoting the use of illegal drugs.

===Pure speech===

One of these factors is whether the activity sought to be controlled is "[[pure speech]]", or sufficiently related to the expression of ideas to fall under the umbrella of the First Amendment. "Pure speech" does not need to involve words but is generally represented by symbols or actions.

===Focus of protected speech activity===
The focus of the protected speech activity, whether ''pure speech'' or not, may affect the propriety of regulation by school officials.

Typically the SLO is developed between the teacher and his/her direct supervisor or principal. As the school year or pre-selected term of the SLO administration proceeds, the teacher will make frequent checks for understanding through various [[formative assessments]]. This will allow the teacher to determine the progression of learning for the student research group. At the conclusion of the school year, the teacher will collect the results and meet with his/her direct supervisor to discuss the data as it applies to the original goal statement.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Educator-Evaluation-System/Ohio-s-Teacher-Evaluation-System/Student-Growth-Measures/Student-Learning-Objective-Examples&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to remember that SLOs have to be content and course specific with outcomes that can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nciea.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-SLOs.mp4&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main benefits of developing and implementing strong SLOs is the ability to increase student achievement at the classroom level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gadoe.org/School-Improvement/Teacher-and-Leader-Effectiveness/Pages/Student-Learning-Objectives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; SLOs are being used as a percentage in the overall teacher evaluation system because it can quantify the pedagogical impact a teacher has on a specific set of students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE/programs/tpe/t/&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main benefits of developing and implementing strong SLOs is the ability to increase student achievement at the [[classroom]] level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gadoe.org/School-Improvement/Teacher-and-Leader-Effectiveness/Pages/Student-Learning-Objectives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; SLOs are being used as a percentage in the overall teacher evaluation system because it can quantify the pedagogical impact a teacher has on a specific set of students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE/programs/tpe/t/&lt;/ref&gt;

An objective is a small goal that needs to be met on the way to fulfilling the larger course outcome or goal.  A typical course will have four to five objectives that focus the various learning activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laney.edu/wp/assessment/how-to-write-slos/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==
* ''[[Data-driven instruction]] &amp; assessment'' - The [[Local Education Agency|local education agency]] (LEA) should review past data gathering systems to determine an overarching goal for individual teacher SLO development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gadoe.org/School-Improvement/Teacher-and-Leader-Effectiveness/Pages/Student-Learning-Objectives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to include all educational stakeholders in this process. One was that this could be accomplished is to discuss the SLO with parents on "Meet the Teacher" night. The feedback from the parents would help to validate the importance of the SLO in the lives of students and their parents. Another way to include parents in the discussion would be to sponsor a Google Document that encourages collaboration on the actual SLO document itself.
* ''Standards-alignment'' - The development of an effective SLO starts with locating an [[Academic standards|academic standard]] that promotes rigorous student learning that results in a measurable student product or outcome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gadoe.org/School-Improvement/Teacher-and-Leader-Effectiveness/Pages/Student-Learning-Objectives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One way to motivate reluctant learners to engage in rigorous academic achievement is to add relevance to their instruction and assessments. For example, when working with a literacy standard dealing with non-fiction reading comprehension it would be beneficial to use real-world documents like an [[electric bill]] or an over-the-counter children's pain relief label. The students apply their reading comprehension strategies to documents that they are likely to encounter in the future.
* ''Instructional timeframe'' - A SLO can occur within any given timeframe between pre-assessment and post-assessment, but the recommended time period is one academic year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gadoe.org/School-Improvement/Teacher-and-Leader-Effectiveness/Pages/Student-Learning-Objectives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nciea.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-SLOs.mp4&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* ''Learning goals'' - A teacher-developed description of what the student will know and be able to do at the end of a course based upon an overarching idea for the academic or elective discipline. A teacher will know that they have an effective learning goal when the knowledge or [[skill]] can be applied to life outside the classroom. Learning goals provide a common thread that link all units and learning situations within a course. It often answers the question, "What is the BIG idea?"
* ''Assessments'' - Valid assessments should support the student progress toward meeting an enduring understanding within the learning goal. The assessments should be based upon standards-aligned to the learning goal. Formative assessment should be collected at multiple points in the semester to determine if the students are on pace to meet the learning goal in the final summative assessment.
* ''Targets'' - Using baseline data gleaned from past performance or collected with a pre-assessment, the teacher will contextualize the SLO by establishing class-specific targets for performance levels. It is important to be ambitious and also realistic about expectations of student performance.

A '''Studentship''' is a type of academic [[scholarship]].

[[File:ESOcast 149 Fast Track Your Career With the ESO Studentship Programme.tif|thumb|Participants of the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] Studentship Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESOcast 149: Fast Track Your Career With the ESO Studentship Programme|url=https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann18008/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==United States==

In the US a ''studentship'' is similar to a [[scholarship]] but involves [[summer]] work on a [[research]] project. The amount paid to the recipient is normally [[tax]]-free, but the recipient is required to fulfill work requirements. Types of studentships vary among [[universities]] and countries. Studentships are sometimes known as [[teaching assistant|teaching]] and [[research assistant]]ships. Studentships are almost exclusively awarded to research students, preferably at the Ph.D. level.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, a 'studentship' is a common name for a PhD scholarship. At [[Christ Church, Oxford]], however, the term ''[[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Studentship]]'' has the same meaning as the term ''[[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellowship]]'' has at other [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]], i.e. the office of a [[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Student]] or the duration thereof, or the [[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Students]] collectively.

==History==
Synap was developed by James Gupta and Omair Vaiyani, two medical students at [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds Medical School]], with an interest in neuroscience and memory. Having used [[spaced repetition]] software such as [[anki (software)|Anki]] in the past, they created a website that allowed students to write [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] quizzes in a [[multiple choice|Multiple Choice Question]] (MCQ) format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Synap had no revenues, but the founders were exploring adding a premium version for paying users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/synaps-app-students-edtech-oxford-lse-1st-quiz-exams-2015-10 "Here's the new app Oxford medics and LSE business students are using to help them get a 1st"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===MyCQs===

The first incarnation of Synap operated under the name 'MyCQs', which was released as a native iOS application and website in 2012, and initially gained popularity amongst UK medical students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/university-of-leeds-students-aiming-to-get-top-marks-for-smartphone-app-1-5058922 "University of Leeds students aiming to get top marks for smartphone app"], Yorkshire Evening Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://time.leeds.ac.uk/time/time_osce.php "Student Generated Resources"], Technology in Medical Education (University of Leeds), retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, CEO James Gupta was recruited as the Chief Technology Officer for [[JumpIn]], a student-focused taxi booking and sharing app.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lec.leeds.ac.uk/casestudies/sam-ryan-and-barney-williams-jumpin/ "Leeds University case studies: JumpIn"], Leeds University Careers, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; The company was acquired by taxi firm [[Addison Lee]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jackwills.com/young-brits-story-far/ "Young brits: the winner's stories so far"], Jack Wills Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cab4now.co.uk/blog/rideshare/rideshare/ "2015: Year of the rideshare?"], Cab4Now, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; after which James returned to focus on MyCQs.

==Functionality==
Synap uses the concept of spaced repetition to send new content to users based on what they need to practice the most. In this sense, Synap is similar to existing spaced repetition platforms such as [[Anki (software)|Anki]] and [[Supermemo|SuperMemo]], though notably it does not support the creation of flashcards, which are more commonly associated with spaced repetition.

==Infrastructure==
Synap was originally developed on Facebook's [[Parse (company)|Parse]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.ac/blog/developing-an-effective-technology-stack "Developing an effective technology stack"], Synap Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Facebook announced that Parse would be closing down, and advised developers to migrate their apps to other services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/ "Moving On"], Parse Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Synap has been hosted on [[Amazon Web Services]], using the newly open-sourced [https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server Parse Server], which itself uses [[Node.js]]. The website is developed in [[Ember.js]], and uses a MongoDB database, making Synap an example of [[MEAN (software bundle)|full stack JavaScript]] development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackshare.io/synap-ac/synap-ac "Synap.ac's technology stack"], StackShare, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
Synap has been featured in The Oxford Public Health Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/oxfordpublichealth/docs/oxph_magazine_issue_4_apr2016 "Oxford Public Health Magazine Issue 4: Innovation and social entrepreneurship (p32-33"], Oxford Public Health Magazine, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

EduwebTV also promotes self-learning among students. Students can access the videos and the day's homework from the website by logging on with a password created by the teacher. The students can hand over their homeworks via email or using conventional exercise book.

* [[English language|English]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Science]]
* [[History]]
* [[Geography]]
* Technical and Vocational
* [[Islamic Studies]]

The '''Information School''' or '''iSchool''' of the [[University of Sheffield]], in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], was founded in 1963 as the University's '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship''' and became in 2010 the first UK [[iSchool]]. Other names were the '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science''' ('''PGSLIS''', 1967-81) and '''Department of Information Studies''' (1981-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iSchool Timeline|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/about/history.html|work=University of Sheffield: Information School|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.

The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016555158901500402 |last=Saunders |first=W. |year=1989|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5| pages = 193–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, like many [[information science]] departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in [[cheminformatics]], educational informatics, [[health informatics]], [[information retrieval]], [[information systems]], knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'' devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1989 | journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol15/issue4-5/|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003|title=Special Issue, 40 years of the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=29 |issue=4|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol29/issue4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research achievements==
The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every [[Research Assessment Exercise]] since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its [[University of Sheffield|University]]) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1992/c26_92t64.html |title=UFC 26/92 - RAE92: The Outcome Table 64 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t61.html |title=1996 RAE - Unit of Assessment: 61 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/results/byuoa/uoa61.htm |title=Results : 2001 Research Assessment Exercise : Unit of Assessment : 61 Library and Information Management |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the [[Times Higher Education]] placed Sheffield at No. 1 again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/18_December_2008/attachments/RAE_2008_THE_RESULTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Times Higher Education Table of Excellence |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.20771 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4579/ |last=Sanderson |first=M. | year=2008 | title=Revisiting h measured on UK LIS and IR academics| journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) |volume=59 |issue=7| pages=1184–1190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an [[i-school|iSchool]].

'''Zubin Damania''' is the founder of [[Turntable Health]], a direct primary care clinic in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] that was funded by [[Zappos]] CEO [[Tony Hsieh]]. Before moving to Las Vegas,  Damania was a practicing [[hospitalist]] (internal medicine physician specializing in patients admitted to the hospital) at [[Stanford University]] for 10 years. He also has been writing and performing comedic raps as [[ZDoggMD]], an [[internet celebrity]] known for his music videos, parodies, and comedy sketches about medical issues as well as systemic issues with healthcare.&lt;ref name="banister1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/speaking-of-rhymes-and-medicine/ |title=Speaking Of… Rhymes and Medicine with ZDoggMD (TCTV) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Damania grew up in [[Clovis, California]], with his parents, both [[Parsi]] doctors who immigrated from [[India]], and two siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://downtownproject.com/2012/the-doctor-is-in-the-hizzouse/ |title=The Doctor is in the Hizzouse |publisher=Downtown Project |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Clovis West High School]] before going on to receive an undergraduate degree at [[UC Berkeley]], where he studied music and molecular biology. While there he completed a research thesis in a genetics lab on integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion pathways in the ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' model with [[James Fristrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/146/1/275 |title=Autosomal Mutations Affecting Adhesion Between Wing Surfaces in Drosophila melanogaster |publisher=Genetics.org |date=1997-05-01 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damania attended medical school at [[UCSF]] and graduated in 1999. His time in school was marked by a series of pursuits that combined comedy and medicine: he streamed medical comedy routines for a startup called Medschool.com, and performed medical based standup routines for drug companies, hospitals and other medical organizations. He also gave the commencement speech at UCSF at his graduation, which has had tens of thousands of views on YouTube, and made NPR's list of top commencement speeches of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.npr.org/commencement/speech/zubin-damania-university-of-california-san-francisco-1999/|title=Zubin Damania, 1999|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of two graduating students chosen to speak at the commencement ceremony he delivered a satirical speech to an audience that included [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[J. Michael Bishop]], and that has since garnered tens of thousands of views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgnHH7Iz37c |title=Funny Graduation Speech &amp;#124; UCSF Med School &amp;#124; ZDoggMD.com |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his residency at Stanford University, Damania stayed on at Palo Alto Medical Foundation for ten years as a hospitalist, where he received the Russell Lee Award for Clinical Teaching while simultaneously maintaining a side hobby performing stand-up comedy for medical audiences worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=34751 |title=Speaker: Zubin Damania |publisher=TEDMED |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disheartened by the traditional fee for service model on which the American medical system is based, Damania became increasingly frustrated with his work. With the encouragement of Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.com, Damania began writing, performing and filming musical parodies about the frustrations of work as a doctor, posting them on YouTube to immediate success. He developed a persona called [[ZDoggMD]] fashioned as a [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]] rapper who was upset about popular misconceptions of healthcare in the US.

Damania gave a presentation called "Are Zombie Doctors Taking Over America?" at [[TEDMED]] 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=34752 |title=Talk Details - Are zombie doctors taking over America? |publisher=TEDMED |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he outlines the lingering problems of the US healthcare system and how he has re-conceived it at Turntable Health into a patient-centered organization dedicated to preventative care. His speech was called one of the best of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baum |first=Stephanie |url=http://medcitynews.com/2013/04/get-a-peek-at-6-of-the-best-tedmed-2013-talks-video/ |title=Get a peek at the 6 best TEDMED 2013 talks (video) |publisher=Medcitynews.com |date=2013-04-19 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[US News and World Report]] called his critique of American healthcare "scalpel-sharp" and "at once discomfiting and comic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan Johnson, Steve Sternberg |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/2013/04/22/tedmed-zdoggmd-and-the-state-of-healthcare |title=TEDMED, ZDoggMD and the State of Healthcare - US News |publisher=Health.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since beginning work on the clinic, Damania has been named one of the "top 14 people to watch in 2014"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2014/jan/09/dr-zubin-damania-ceo-and-founder-turntable-health/ |title=Dr. Zubin Damania, CEO and Founder of Turntable Health |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[Las Vegas Weekly]]'', and has been profiled in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'',&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenfeld |first=Paul |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/the-doctor-rapper-and-ceo-who-intend-to-fix-healthcare/280438/ |title=The Doctor-Rapper and CEO Who Intend to Fix Healthcare - Aimee Swartz |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xconomy]],&lt;ref name="xconomy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/01/14/welcome-to-zappos-style-health-innovation/ |title=Welcome to Zappos-Style Health Innovation |publisher=Xconomy |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', [[Venture Beat]], [[Gizmodo]], [[MSNBC]] and [[USA Today]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdoggmd.com/about-z/ |title=Medical Humor &amp;#124; Funny Videos |publisher=ZDoggMD |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turntable Health was also named "by far the most exciting healthcare startup" and "revolutionary" by The Next Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerber |first=Scott |url=https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/01/26/8-ways-startups-revolutionizing-health-care/#!vYs5H |title=8 Ways Startups Are Changing the Healthcare Industry |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZdoggMD's work has been called "entertainment that might save your life"{{fact|date=May 2017}}, he has been labeled "the jolliest doctor on the West Coast",&lt;ref name="med" /&gt; and "a genuine doctor who uses YouTube as a creativity outlet to teach people about things like safe sex, delivering bad news, stayin' healthy on vacation and hemorrhoids."&lt;ref name="techcrunch" /&gt; His videos cover topics such as ulcers, testicular exams, Caribbean medical schools, stool transplants, overworked doctors, the role of hospitalists in medicine versus other specialists, vaccine controversies, healthcare in the US, CPR, television doctors, and being on call during the holidays.

==Turntable Health==
In 2012 Tony Hsieh invited Damania to visit Las Vegas, where Hsieh was in the process of investing $350 million of his own money in a project he hoped would revitalize Downtown Las Vegas ([[The Downtown Project]]). He was successful in convincing Damania to quit his job as Physician at Stanford and move his family to Nevada. Hsieh tasked Damania with "fixing Healthcare in Vegas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schoenmann |first=Joe |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/jan/12/joe-downtown-new--downtown-doctor-sets-out-desmyst/ |title=Joe Downtown: New-to-downtown doctor sets out to demystify medicine - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Las Vegas, Damania continued to produce videos both as ZDoggMD and himself while working on opening Turntable Health.

While conceiving of the idea for Turntable Health, Damania met Rushika Fernandopulle, co-founder and CEO of a Boston-based startup called Iora Health, who had become well known for his vision to rebuild healthcare by removing fee-for-service episodic payments from primary care, focusing on prevention, and using a membership model. The two forged a partnership.&lt;ref name="xconomy1"/&gt;

Turntable Health, a direct primary care clinic in Downtown Las Vegas, was the result of their collaboration. It was based on a patient focused, preventative model that subscribers could either pay a monthly fee for, or have as part of their coverage in some cases.&lt;ref name="lasvegascitylife1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rake |first=Launce |url=http://lasvegascitylife.com/blog/town/downtown-clinic-promises-new-model-health-care.html |title=Downtown Clinic Promises "New Model" Of Health Care |publisher=Las Vegas CityLife |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic opened in December, 2013, and was an integral part of Hsieh’s Downtown Project of revitalizing Las Vegas and re-visualizing urban spaces.&lt;ref name="lasvegascitylife1"/&gt; Turntable Health shut down as of January 31, 2017.
