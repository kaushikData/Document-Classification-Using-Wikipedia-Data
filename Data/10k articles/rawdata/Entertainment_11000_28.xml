      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">An '''antimasque''' (also spelled '''antemasque''') is a comic or [[grotesque dance]] presented before or between the acts of a [[masque]], a type of dramatic composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=William Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd|edition=Digital|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antimasque|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antimasque is a spectacle of disorder which usually starts or precedes the masque itself and was played by professional actors while members of the court primarily performed the roles of the masque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Michael|title=The antimasque|url=http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/stage/masques/antimasque.html|website=Shakespeare's Life and Times|publisher=University of Victoria|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by impropriety and is transformed by the masque into goodness, propriety, and order, typically by the King's presence alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astington|first1=John|title=English Court Theatre 1558 -1642|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-64065-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9EJ7Re8Pe0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=ballet+grotesque&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oDtr2Oxgge&amp;sig=AaYViXHavhGlKTGQ4SHUslYFaRs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FVRFTaCmNoGKhQfY8ajeAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=antimasque&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also contrasted with the masque by the use of the lower class as characters.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=masque (entertainment)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368090/masque#ref141490|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then was supposed to harmonize with the king and the higher class.
In later years, the antimasque developed into a [[farce]] or [[pantomime]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; The concept of the antemasque, or anti-masque, was conceived by [[Ben Jonson]].&lt;ref&gt;Eras of the dance: the George Verdak Collection,  Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, Huntsville Museum of Art - 1976 "The antemasque was an innovation by Jonson which introduced the grotesque or antic element to the performance which preceded the masque proper. The antemasque differed from the masque in that it was performed by professionals .."&lt;/ref&gt;  Masques originally usually had one antemasque before the main masque, but later it became common to have several antemasques preceding the main masque.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works'' 2010 p.1324 0199580537   "Earlier masques usually had one antemasque, which preceded the main masque, but later it became common for the masques to have several antemasques."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mara R. Wade ''Gender Matters: Discourses of Violence in Early Modern Literature'' 9401210233 - 2013 "This moment, along with the antemasque's inclusion of the marriage god Hymen, recalls Ben Jonson's The Masque of Hymen (1606), in which Juno and eight ladies descend from above. Bianca adopts another common feature of Jonson's ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">An '''audio signal''' is a representation of [[sound]], typically as an electrical [[voltage]] for [[analog signal]]s and a binary number for [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s. Audio signals have frequencies in the [[audio frequency]] range of roughly 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Human hearing range|limits of human hearing]]). Audio signals may be [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] directly, or may originate at a [[transducer]] such as a [[microphone]], [[Pickup (music technology)|musical instrument pickup]], [[phonograph]] cartridge, or [[tape head]]. [[Loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]] convert an electrical audio signal into sound.

[[Digital audio]] systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.1. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audio channel''' or '''audio track''' is an audio signal [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] in a [[data storage device|storage device]] or [[mixing console]], used in operations such as [[multi-track recording]] and [[sound reinforcement]].

== Signal flow ==
[[Audio signal flow|Signal flow]] is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a [[home audio]] system or long and convoluted in a [[recording studio]] and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large [[Mixing console|console]], external [[audio equipment]], and even different rooms.

==Parameters==
Audio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[nominal level]], [[Electric power|power]] level in [[decibel]]s (dB), and voltage level. The relation between power and voltage is determined by the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the signal path, which may be [[Single-ended signalling|single-ended]] or [[Balanced line|balanced]].

Audio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional [[Mixing console|mixing consoles]] are most commonly at [[line level]]. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a ''mic level''.

== Digital equivalent ==
The digital form of an audio signal is used in [[audio plug-in]]s and [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal.

A digital audio signal being sent through wire can use several formats including [[optical]] ([[ADAT]], [[TDIF]]), [[coaxial]] ([[S/PDIF]]), [[XLR connector|XLR]] ([[AES/EBU]]), and [[Audio over Ethernet|Ethernet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4412">'''Automodello''' is a manufacturer of resin-cast [[Model car|hand-built models]] in a variety of scales. The company is headquartered in Buffalo Grove, Illinois.

==Inaugural introduction==
Automodello was started by James Cowen who released the inaugural model, a 1964 Griffith Series 200, in 2010 at the prestigious [[Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance]] where it was designated the ''Official Model'' for the event (Model Collector 2017). Models were signed by Andrew "Jack" Griffith, founder of Griffith sports car that later became the TVR.

==Marques offered==
Automodello tends to focus on British and American vehicles that have been overlooked by the modeling community. Through 2014, Automodello has released or will release thirty-six separate models (Automodello Collections no date). Though the company started out with 1:43 scale reproductions to exacting standards, larger scales have increasingly been offered, including a very large 1:8 (a traditionally popular scale for clay models made by designers in the large auto companies. The following are the models currently offered or planned:

1:43 scale:
* 1934 Duesenberg J Graber
* 1937 Delahaye 135MS Figoni &amp; Falaschi Coupe 
* 1938 Lincoln K V12 [[John B Judkins Company|Judkins]] Coupe

* 1965 Ford GT40 Roadster Prototype Pricing
* 2011-2014 Noble M600

==Model details==
Automodello vehicles are finely detailed, especially their 1:8 scale reproductions which can cost thousands of dollars. Still, even their smaller offerings are intricate. The Cunningham C-3, for example, can be displayed with soft top or top boot. Its carpet is flocked and wire wheels have deeply laser cut spokes (McCourt 2014a, p.&amp;nbsp;16). Only 154 of the Cunninghams were made by Automodello. The Avanti R2 offered in 1:43 scale was likewise detailed with accurate windshield wipers, instrument panel and rubber bumper tips (McCourt 2014b, p.&amp;nbsp;15).

==Distribution==
Automodello models are sold through Diecasm and Automodello Full Service Dealers around the world. Typical production is between 100 and 600 pieces per issue, though tooling may be extended to varied models and liveries. For example, the Griffith and TVR have the same basic body, which means the tooling, with minor variations, is made to last as long as possible.

Models may include signed editions by persons such as Jack Griffith (father of the Griffith and TVR), Herb Grasse (designer of the [[Bricklin SV-1]]), and John Fitch ([[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] racer, and road-safety inventor).

'''''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II''''' is a 2004 [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]]/[[hack and slash]] [[video game]] for [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Developed by [[Black Isle Studios]], the game was published by [[Interplay Entertainment]], and distributed by [[Vivendi Games|Vivendi Universal Games]] in North America and [[Avalon Interactive]] in Europe. It is the sequel to the 2001 game ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]''.

The game is set in the [[Forgotten Realms]] [[campaign setting]] of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', and the gameplay is based on the rules of [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd Edition]], which were released in 2000.&lt;ref name="Sequel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/03/24/dark-alliance-ii-announced | title=Dark Alliance II Announced | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=March 24, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dark Alliance II'' is a direct sequel to the original ''Dark Alliance'' game, with the story following five adventurers attempting to save [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]] from a growing evil, and ascertain the fate of the protagonists from the first game.

''Dark Alliance II'' was well received on both platforms, although many critics felt it was not much of an advancement on the first game. A sequel was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems and the closure of Black Isle Studios after Interplay went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |title=Interplay shuts down Black Isle Studios |date=December 8, 2003 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/fallout3/news_6085243.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613125717/http://gamespot.com/pc/rpg/fallout3/news_6085243.html | archivedate=June 13, 2006 | accessdate= May 1, 2006|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the [[Snowblind Studios game engine|Dark Alliance game engine]] also led to a lawsuit filed by the engine's creators, [[Snowblind Studios]], against publishers Interplay, which alleged the engine had been used in the game without Snowblind's permission.

''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II'' is a [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[hack and slash]]/[[action role-playing game]] presented in a [[3D computer graphics|3D perspective]], with a rotatable [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] three-quarter [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down view]].&lt;ref name="IGNPS2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2004/01/21/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-4 | publisher=[[IGN]] | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Review (PS2) | last=Lewis | first=Ed | date=January 20, 2004 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the game, [[Statistic (role-playing games)|character stats]] are preset, with the player able to choose from five [[List of character races in Dungeons &amp; Dragons|race]]/[[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|class]] combinations; a [[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|human]] [[Barbarian (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|barbarian]] (Dorn Redbear), a  [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|drow]] [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|monk]] (Vhaidra Uoswiir), a [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|moon-elf]] [[necromancer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|necromancer]] (Ysuran Auondril), a [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarven]] [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|rogue]] (Borador Goldhand) or a human [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]] (Allessia Faithhammer).&lt;ref name="Characters"&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Heroes of Baldur's Gate | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2004 | pages=7–8 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can customize their character's stats through gaining [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies. Every time the character increases in level, points are awarded corresponding to that level; i.e. if a character increases to level twelve, the player will gain twelve experience points to spend on the character's spells and feats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Spells and feats | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2004 | page=31 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every four levels which the character increases, the player is given one ability point to spend on one of the six core [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]] (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Character abilities | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2004 | page=20 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the five characters have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. Dorn is a Barbarian, and his feats tend to focus on increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to wield two-handed weapons in each hand. Vhaidra relies on unarmed combat, so her feats tend to focus on increasing her speed and [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], as well as granting her close-range abilities, such as pushing enemies away from her. As Ysuran is a necromancer, his feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his magic and granting him new spells, such as the ability to use shadow magic. Borador tends more towards archery, but is also capable of melee combat. His spells tend to focus on allowing him to use a shield offensively, and granting him the ability to set traps for enemies and disarm traps intended for the player. Allessia is a cleric and has access to many healing and defensive spells. She can also use melee combat. Later in the game she gains the ability to reanimate the [[Zombie (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dead]], and have them fight alongside her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Spell and active feats | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2001 | pages=33–38 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameplay is semi-linear; most of the main [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]] can be performed in different orders, but only from within a group of given quests. For example, in Act I, the player can choose to tackle a series of kidnappings or investigate a spate of murders, but no other main quests are made available until both quests are complete. There are also optional [[Quest (video gaming)#Side-quest|side-quests]], which do not have to be completed immediately. There are more [[non-player character|NPCs]] than in the first game, and the player can interact with many of them. Depending on which character the player is using, these NPCs may or may not provide information and assistance. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location throughout the game, a shop in [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]], although the stock changes at the commencement of each act, with the weapons increasing in expense and power. The [[Head-up display|HUD]] features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a [[mini-map]], with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.

The game also features [[cooperative gameplay]] with another player. Both players share the same screen, and are thus limited in how far they can move away from one another. In co-op mode, both players get 50% of the experience for each kill, no matter which player makes the kill. Additionally, unlike in the original game, all treasure is shared 50/50 between both players, irrespective of which player collects it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Spoils of combat | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2001 | pages=24 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new feature in ''Dark Alliance II'' gives players the ability to create custom weapons and armor. Players can improve items by using [[runestone]]s and gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113356107.html | last=Newman | first=Heather | title=Mini video-game reviews | work=[[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder Tribune]] | publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] | date=February 17, 2004 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}} {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the strength of an item, at least one runestone must be used. Gems are optional, although adding gems increases the strength further and enhances certain of the items' attributes. The player cannot place more gems on an item than runestones; if the player wishes to place four gems, they must have a minimum of four runestones attached. Each item can have two different types of gem attached at any one time, in addition to the required runestones. There are several different kinds of gem and each has a different effect on different types of item. For example, a [[pearl]] attached to a piece of armor gives +1 additional treasure drop, attached to a weapon gives +1 "Improved Critical", and attached to a trinket gives +1 Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1977 | chapter=Workshops | last=Baker | first=Tim | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | year=2001 | pages=29–30 | id=T202110 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game contains four difficulty levels; "Easy", "Normal", "Hard" and "Extreme". Extreme is unlocked once the player has completed any of the other three levels. Extreme mode takes the form of a [[New Game Plus]], and can only be played by importing a saved character from another game. The game also contains two secret characters; [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Artemis Entreri]]. Drizzt becomes available to use in the main game upon beating any difficulty level. Artemis is unlocked upon defeating Extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/914543-baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii/cheats | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II (PlayStation 2) Cheats | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance#Plot}}

===Setting and characters===
While the original game focused on three areas in the [[List of regions in Faerûn#Sword Coast|Sword Coast]] and [[List of regions in Faerûn#Western Heartlands|Western Heartlands]] regions of the [[Faerûn]]ian continent, the second game is predominately based in and around the city of [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]] itself.

The game features five main playable characters; Dorn Redbear, Ysuran Aundril, Borador Goldhand, Vhaidra Uoswiir and Allessia Faithhammer, each of whom has come to Baldur's Gate for different reasons. Dorn seeks fame and glory. Vhaidra has come looking for vengeance against those who have attempted to destroy her family. Ysuran is suffering from [[amnesia]] and has come in the hope of finding clues to his past. Borador comes for wealth, in order to release his clan from its debt to the drow. Allessia comes to spread the word of [[Helm (Forgotten Realms)|Helm]] and advance to become a high-ranking priest.&lt;ref name="Characters"/&gt;

===Story===
The game begins by revealing the fate of the three protagonists from the first game; after jumping through the portal at the top of the Onyx Tower, Vahn, Kromlech and Adrianna are taken prisoner by the [[Vampire (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|vampire]] Mordoc SeLanmere.

Meanwhile, outside Baldur's Gate, fate brings Dorn, Vhaidra, Ysuran, Borador and Allessia together. Upon meeting on the Trade Way, they learn that since the collapse of Xantam's Guild, the route has become increasingly dangerous due to the rise of the Red Fang Marauders, a [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblin]] army who prey on travelers. After infiltrating a nearby Marauders cave, and freeing the caravan guard Randalla, the heroes head to Wayfork Village, a nearby [[fief]]dom. There, they rescue the village from the Marauders and kill their [[hobgoblin]] leader, Harnak.

Upon entering Baldur's Gate, to assist them in earning some money, Randalla hires them to investigate a series of murders in the city. At Bloodmire Manor, they learn that Luvia Bloodmire has been combining the body parts of various creatures in an attempt to make a new species, and has been giving her creations to Lady Aragozia Firewind. Her first creation, Argesh, has set up the Hands of Glory, a thieves' guild faction of the Marauders. The heroes kill Argesh, crippling the Hands of Glory, and infiltrate the main base of the Marauders. There, they defeat but do not kill the Red Queen, leader of the Marauders. They follow her to Lady Arogazia's manor, and learn that Arogazia is actually a member of the [[Zhentarim]], a criminal network intent on ruling Faerûn. She has been using the Marauders in an effort to bring back the Onyx Tower. Along with her associate Kharne (a former member of Xantham's Guild, who was presumed killed in the first game), Arogazia escapes from the heroes, transforming into a Fire [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Dragon]], Aizagora. Impressed with their efforts, Jherek, a member of the [[Harpers (Forgotten Realms)|Harpers]], approaches the heroes and requests they retrieve four elemental objects. At the same time, the Zhentarim are also trying to attain the objects in an effort to reactivate the Onyx Tower. During their journey, the heroes encounter Sleyvas, the humanoid lizard who betrayed the protagonists at the end of ''Dark Alliance''. He too is working for the Zhentarim, although the heroes kill him. Having successfully found the four objects for Jherek, each of the heroes then pursues their own personal quest.

After killing the dragon Baragoth, the [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druid]] inside Dorn is awakened. Ysuran realizes his horrific past and his hate crimes against humans, determining that he will not worry about the past, but instead build a good name for himself in the future. Borador frees Gandam's Hold and reclaims the Goblinbreaker name for his clan, who begin working on new forges to free themselves from their debt to fey folk. Vhaidra travels to Cloud Peaks and gets her revenge on a murderous black elf who assisted in the fall of her family's house. Allessia frees the Church of Helm in Baldur's Gate from Goreth Vileback, a cleric of [[Cyric]].

After the five return to town, Jherek enlists them once again, for a journey to each of the Elemental Planes to activate the Elemental Foundations using the four objects they recovered earlier. In each plane, they are attacked by the Zhentarim, who are in control of the Foundations. Two of the Zhentarim who attack them are Luvia Bloodmire and Aizagora, but both are defeated. However, upon returning from the final plane and speaking to Jherek, they are all shocked when they are approached by Kharne. He tells them the Zhentarim no longer wish to reactivate the Onyx Tower, and that the Harpers and the Zhentarim have a common enemy; Mordoc SeLanmere. Mordoc believes he can use the Tower to bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate, which will please his "allies in the east." His steward, Xanhast, interrogates Vahn, Adrianna and Kromlech, finding they know little of the larger scheme playing out. However, Kharne, Jherek and the five adventurers storm Mordoc's Keep of Pale Night. They rescue the trio of adventurers, forcing Mordoc to speed up his plans, and relocate the Onyx Tower into Baldur's Gate ahead of schedule.

Now called Mordoc's Gate, the entire population of the city are turned into [[Zombie (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|zombies]]. The five adventurers attack the Tower and kill Xanhast, finally attacking Mordoc in the Elemental Plane of Shadows. After killing him, they destroy the Onyx Heart, supposedly destroying the Tower forever. This releases the citizens from their zombification, and led by Randalla, they gather to thank the heroes for saving the city. Meanwhile, in a room with an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ''milieu'', a servant tells a stone [[sarcophagus]] that Mordoc has failed and Baldur's Gate still stands. The sarcophagus says that Mordoc's failure will not interrupt "my sacred mission," and orders his servant to prepare the army and ready his sun barge. As with the first game, ''Dark Alliance II'' ends on a [[cliffhanger]].

==Development and cancelled sequel==
''Dark Alliance II'' was first mentioned as early as April 17, 2001, when [[Interplay Entertainment]] confirmed that if the first game was successful, a sequel would enter development immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2001/04/17/interplay-talks-finances-the-matrix-and-sequels | title=Interplay Talks Finances, The Matrix, and Sequels | date=April 7, 2001 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game was not officially announced until March 24, 2003, when Interplay revealed they were working on a sequel for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The only information available at the time was that the game would introduce item crafting, have five playable characters and was slated for a simultaneous PlayStation/Xbox release in the winter of 2003.&lt;ref name="Sequel"/&gt; On May 6, [[IGN]] published an interview with Kevin Osburn, head of the development team at [[Black Isle Studios]] and the game's producer. Osburn revealed the developers had taken on-board criticisms of the first game, and addressed those problems in the sequel, as well as making everything bigger, with more enemies, characters, weapons, locations and quests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/05/06/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-interview?page=1 | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Interview | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=May 6, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in May 2003, Interplay showcased the Xbox version of the game, revealing three of the new characters: a human barbarian, a moon-elf necromancer and a drow monk. Interplay stated that if the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions sold well, they would consider porting the game to [[GameCube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-hands-on-impressions/1100-6028246/ | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Hands-On Impressions | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Park | first=Andrew | accessdate=June 18, 2011 | date=May 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, demos for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were released. All five characters were available for play, and their character-specific sidequests were finalized. Weapon creation was also showcased, as was co-op mode. The game was set for an October release. Both IGN and [[GameSpot]] were impressed with the demo, although both expressed some concern that the [[Video game graphics|graphics]] were essentially the same as the first game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-impressions/1100-6071844/ | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Impressions | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Torres | first=Ricardo | date=July 17, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/07/17/baldurs-gate-2-hands-on | title=Baldur's Gate 2 Hands-on | publisher=[[IGN]] | last=Hwang | first=Kaiser | date=July 17, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2003 [[Gen Con]] in July, Interplay revealed the game was 90% complete and on schedule for an October release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-updated-impressions/1100-6072439/ | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Updated Impressions | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Park | first=Andrew | date=July 25, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on September 29, Interplay announced it had canceled its distribution deal with [[Vivendi Games|Vivendi Universal Games]], due to alleged breaches of the working agreement and failure of payment. Herve Caen, CEO of Interplay, stated

{{quote|In the interest of our company and its [[shareholder]]s, we had no choice but to terminate this agreement. After several notifications to Vivendi of its failure to perform in accordance with the terms of our agreement and, in particular, in refusing to pay Interplay certain monies due following our latest release, ''[[Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader|Lionheart]]'', we still did not receive the payments owed to us. We are currently evaluating several other distribution options. We fully expect to release two of our strongest titles, ''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II'' and ''[[Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel]]'' for Xbox and PlayStation 2 in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/vivendi-dumped-by-interplay/1100-6076127/ | title=Vivendi dumped by Interplay | last=Calvert | first=Justin | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=September 29, 2003 | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October, [[EB Games]] and [[GameStop]] websites changed the release dates for the game to January 2004. Interplay initially denied the delay, stating it was still aiming for a fourth quarter release, and would distribute the game themselves if need be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-and-dark-alliance-ii-release-date-debacle/1100-6076898/ | title=Fallout and Dark Alliance II release date debacle | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Thorsen | first=Tor | date=October 16, 2003 | accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, Interplay announced it had resolved its legal dispute with Vivendi, and had returned to their prior distribution agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/vu-games-and-interplay-back-together/1100-6078266/ | title=VU Games and Interplay back together | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Calvert | first=Justin | date=November 6, 2003 | accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, they officially confirmed that ''Dark Alliance II'' would be delayed until early 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/definitely-no-dark-alliance-ii-until-04/1100-6083432/ | title=Definitely no Dark Alliance II until '04 | accessdate=June 18, 2011 | date=November 12, 2003 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Thorsen | first=Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, reports surfaced that Interplay had shut down Black Isle Studios, although Interplay itself made no formal statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/interplay-shuts-down-black-isle-studios/1100-6085243/ | title=Interplay shuts down Black Isle Studios | accessdate=June 18, 2011 | date=December 8, 2003 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | last=Thorsen | first=Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/12/10/black-isle-folds | title=Black Isle Folds | accessdate=September 7, 2013 | date=December 9, 2003 | publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, IGN reported that Black Isle Studios had definitely been closed, and now existed only as a brand under the Interplay label. They reported that when Black Isle's director had quit, the studio was placed under the management of Digital Mayhem, but with the agreement that Interplay would adopt a more hands-off approach. By this stage, Black Isle had already begun work on ''Dark Alliance III''. However, the title was cancelled after Interplay failed to retain the license to use the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' label from [[Wizards of the Coast]], so Black Isle shifted focus to ''[[Van Buren (video game)|Fallout 3]]''. They handed in a 95% complete demo, including all game functionality. The next day, however, Interplay, who were several million dollars in debt, with just over $1 million in the bank, began to fire people from Digital Mayhem. Two weeks later, all but two members of the ''Fallout'' team were fired. This effectively meant Black Isle Studios no longer existed as anything other than a brand. Apparently, staff were told by Interplay that "we will continue to produce titles.

However, on December 18, Interplay denied shutting the studio, claiming "Black Isle Studios remains open with projects pending, the status of ''Fallout 3'' is under review, and ''Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel'' will ship on January 13."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/12/19/black-isle-not-closed | title=Black Isle Not Closed? | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=December 18, 2003 | accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the very next day, December 19, an anonymous former Black Isle employee confirmed to IGN that the studio had been closed, and that although ''Dark Alliance II'' would still be released, ''Fallout 3'' and ''Dark Alliance III'' had been officially cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2003/12/19/another-black-isle-source-comes-forward | title=Another Black Isle Source Comes Forward | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=December 19, 2003 | accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2004 Interplay announced that ''Dark Alliance II'' was complete and would be released for both PlayStation and Xbox on January 20. Interplay published the game, with Vivendi distributing in North America, and [[Avalon Interactive]] distributing in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-ii-goes-gold/1100-6086042/ | title=Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II goes gold | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=January 5, 2004 | last=Calvert | first=Justin | accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===
In November 2003, [[Snowblind Studios]], developers of the original ''Dark Alliance'' and creators of the [[Snowblind Studios game engine|Dark Alliance engine]], filed a [[lawsuit]] against Interplay. Snowblind alleged that Interplay had used the game engine in several games without their permission and withheld royalties due from the sale of those games. These games were the GameCube version of the first ''Dark Alliance'' game, which was developed by [[High Voltage Software]], ''Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel'', and ''Dark Alliance II''. The lawsuit was settled on April 19, 2005, and determined that while Interplay could continue to publish materials already using the Dark Alliance engine, they could not use the engine in any future projects. The lawsuit also saw Interplay transfer the ''Baldur's Gate'' [[trademark]] to [[Atari]] and temporarily transfer the ''Dark Alliance'' trademark to Snowblind; "Interplay hereby grants to Snowblind a security interest in the ''Dark Alliance'' Trademark to secure the investment and expected return of Snowblind and its licensees in the event of [[bankruptcy]] of Interplay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.secinfo.com/d13nF9.vFs.c.htm | title=Interplay Entertainment Corp 10-K for 12/31/05 EX-10 | date=June 19, 2006 | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack for ''Dark Alliance II'' was never released. However, in September 2013, composer Craig Stuart Garfinkle did release an album called ''Songs of the Dragon, V2'' featuring primarily music from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Songs-Dragon-Music-Baldurs-Gate/dp/B00G0PBA6C | title=Songs of the Dragon, V2 | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II'' received "generally favorable reviews," with the PlayStation 2 version holding an aggregate score of 78 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on forty-four reviews,&lt;ref name="MCPS2"/&gt; and the Xbox version 77 out of 100, based on forty-four reviews.&lt;ref name="MCXB"/&gt;

''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, calling it "[[Role-playing game|role-playing]] bliss." He praised the range of characters, missions and weaponry, the item customization, the non-linear structure and the range of environments. Comparing the game to the original, he called it "a much deeper play with a higher level of interaction."&lt;ref name="GIPS2"/&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Ed Lewis scored the game 8.4 out of 10, writing "Black Isle Studios have made an appropriate continuation of the story, but don't create enough changes that some may feel a sequel deserves." He was critical of the similarity of the gameplay to the first game; "there is still all of the [[dungeon crawl]]ing action that has worked well in the past and still works here, but there's still not enough that's new to truly keep pushing the genre forward. There could be more weapons and more characters, but the real issue is that the world is still a fairly linear adventure with a steady pace towards the end."&lt;ref name="IGNPS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNXB"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s Ryan Davis scored the game 8 out of 10, writing "Though not as impressive as the original game, ''Dark Alliance II'' will surely satisfy players looking for a well-crafted, accessible action RPG experience." He praised the range of missions, and the ability to craft new weaponry, but was critical of the graphics, which he felt hadn't really advanced from the first game. He concluded "''Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance'' was an RPG for people who didn't like RPGs, and its sequel does a fine job of maintaining that design philosophy."&lt;ref name="GSpotPS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpotXB"/&gt;

[[Eurogamer]]'s Ronan Jennings scored the Xbox version 7 out of 10, writing "in terms of progression, the only real difference between this and ''Dark Alliance'' is that the first game felt like it had better structure to it. In fact, ''DAII'' feels more like an [[expansion pack]] in that regard, with players sometimes given the option to complete quests in any order they choose [...] It's hard not to be disappointed in ''Dark Alliance II''. However, it's equally hard to criticise such a polished effort. On the one hand, it offers more of the great hack and slash gameplay that no one has emulated properly since the first ''Dark Alliance''. On the other hand, the magic of the original has definitely been diluted, where it really should have been enhanced."&lt;ref name="EuroXB"/&gt;

[[GameSpy]]'s Raymond Padulla scored the PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the differentiation in the fighting style of the playable characters, writing, "the additional variety in ''Dark Alliance II'' is one of the few cases where more translates to better." However, he felt that when compared with the original game, "while it is superior in a few ways, it's inferior in others." He was critical of the graphics, writing "there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down." He concluded "I was convinced that more of a great thing would be an even greater thing. I thought Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While ''Dark Alliance II'' is a good game, it has barely progressed the series."&lt;ref name="GSpyPS2"/&gt; Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; "Black Isle Studios took over the development chores on this edition, and essentially delivered the same game again. Unfortunately, gamers had moved on [...] In short, while ''Dark Alliance II'' was by no means a bad game, it badly needed updating before it could become relevant again.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rausch | first=Allen | date=August 19, 2004 | url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/540/540375p5.html | title=A History of ''D&amp;D'' Video Games - Part V | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ian Williams of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' rated the game #7 on his list of "The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames". He commented: "The console market wanted in on the fun after so many years of rad ''D&amp;D'' RPGs being on PC either exclusively or first. And that's how a loud, brash, fun as heck hack and slash RPG series set in the [[Forgotten Realms]] was born. It's way more ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' than ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'', despite the name. That means, aside from the style of play, you can't design your characters from scratch. But the playable characters offer a wide variety of playstyles, while the customization as you level means that you can fine tune as you go. Topping it off is a co-op mode which is so much fun that even [[Drizzt Do'Urden|Drizzt]] showing up can't ruin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/04/the-10-greatest-dungeons-and-dragons-videogames.html | title=The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames | publisher=''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' | last=Williams | first=Ian | date=April 27, 2015 | access-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Blurred Lines'''" is a single written and performed by American recording artists [[Robin Thicke]], [[T.I.]], and [[Pharrell Williams]]. Produced by Pharrell, it serves as the lead single from [[Blurred Lines (album)|Thicke's album of the same name]]. It was released on March 26, 2013 through Pharrell's label [[Star Trak]] Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blurred-lines-feat.-t.i.-pharrell/id621507456|title=Blurred Lines (feat.

Thicke and Williams were found liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury in March 2015, and Gaye was awarded posthumous songwriting credit based on the royalties pledged to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3161742/Judge-trims-Blurred-Lines-song-dispute-verdict-5-3M.html |title=Judge trims Blurred Lines song dispute verdict to $5.3million |date=July 15, 2015 |newspaper=The Daily Mail |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song's [[music video]] was released in two versions, with one featuring models [[Emily Ratajkowski]], Jessi M'Bengue, and [[Elle Evans]] being topless, while the other censored nudity. The uncut version of the video was at one time removed from YouTube for violating the site's [[terms of service]] regarding nudity; it was later restored, but with an age restriction. The song's lyrics and music video have proven controversial with some groups, with claims that it is [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and promotes [[date rape]]. This has led to the song being banned at some [[students' unions]] in universities and other institutions in the [[United Kingdom]] and prompted a rebuttal from Thicke.

"Blurred Lines" peaked at number one in at least 25 countries and became the number one song of 2013 in several of them. It became Thicke's first, T.I.'s fourth, and Pharrell's third number-one single in the US, where it was also the longest running number one single of 2013. The song subsequently became [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling singles of all time]], with sales of 14.8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/music-sales-ifpi-2013-spotify-streaming |title=Global music sales fell in 2013 despite strong growth for streaming services |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously breaking the record for the largest radio audience in history.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' sets radio audience record, label says|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-robin-thickes-blurred-lines-radio-audience-record-20130726,0,4749230.story|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=30 July 2013|first=Mikael|last=Wood|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was nominated for two Grammys at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5819883/grammy-awards-2014-full-nominations-list-complete-nominees|title=Grammy Awards 2014: Full Nominations List|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has been parodied and [[cover version|covered]] numerous times.

== Background ==
"Blurred Lines" was produced by Thicke and Pharrell with an intention of creating a sound similar to Marvin Gaye's "[[Got to Give It Up]]" (1977). The song was completed in less than an hour.&lt;ref name=reuter&gt;{{cite web|last=Reuter|first=Annie|title=Robin Thicke On His First No. 1, 'Blurred Lines': 'We Didn't Know It Would Be This Big'|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/06/12/robin-thicke-on-his-first-no-1-blurred-lines-we-didnt-know-it-would-be-this-big/|publisher=[[Radio.com]]|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'s'' Stelios Phili, Thicke explained:

{{quote|Pharrell and I were in the studio and [...] I was like, "Damn, we should make something like that ['Got to Give It Up'], something with that groove." Then he started playing a little something and we literally wrote the song in about half an hour and recorded it. He and I would go back and forth where I'd sing a line and he'd be like, "Hey, hey, hey!" We started acting like we were two old men on a porch hollering at girls like, "Hey, where you going, girl? Come over here!"&lt;ref name=phili&gt;{{cite web|last=Phili|first=Stelios|title=Robin Thicke on That Banned Video, Collaborating with 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar, and His New Film|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/05/robin-thicke-interview-blurred-lines-music-video-collaborating-with-2-chainz-and-kendrick-lamar-mercy.html|publisher=''[[GQ]]''|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a separate interview, Thicke clarified the meaning of the song's title, saying it referred to "the good-girl/bad-girl thing and what's appropriate".&lt;ref name=payne&gt;{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Chris|title=Robin Thicke Talks 'Happier' New Album, Calls 'Blurred Lines' Video 'Semi-Existential'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/1561343/robin-thicke-talks-happier-new-album-calls-blurred-lines-video|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thicke and manager Jordan Feldstein decided the song would not have much impact through radio and would need an innovative approach to become a hit.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JFeldstein.html |title=Interview with Jordan Feldstein |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldstein told [[HitQuarters]]: "We had an artist that had never had a hit on radio. It was a non-traditional song; it didn't sound like a [[Timbaland]] or [[Benny Blanco]] record. So we had to approach the market in an interesting way." Feldstein came up with the idea of creating a video designed to go viral and brought in experienced music video director [[Diane Martel]] to shoot it. Its controversial nature was designed to attract attention with Feldstein saying: "I knew it would get it banned quickly ... Getting something banned actually helps you."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt;

== Music videos ==
The [[music video]], directed by [[Diane Martel]], was released on March 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Thicke – Blurred Lines ft. T.I., Pharrell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU|work=YouTube|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video features Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell casually standing in front of light-pink backdrop as they flirt with models ([[Emily Ratajkowski]], [[Lindsey Evans|Elle Evans]] and Jessi M'Bengue) who pose and dance. At various points, the [[hashtag]] "#THICKE" flashes, whilst towards the end, "ROBIN THICKE HAS A BIG DICK" is spelled out in silver balloons. In the unrated version of the video, the models wear just [[thong (clothing)|thongs]]. In the edited version, they are scantily clad and the hashtag "#BLURREDLINES" is seen at various points. This is the second time that director Diane Martel and Pharrell join together for a music video project involving two differently rated versions. The 2001 video for the N.E.R.D single "[[Lapdance (song)|Lapdance]]" also featured models in two variant editions, one of which, like "Blurred Lines", is a topless version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Kara: Nudey rudey comeback|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10879566|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald | date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Lapdance" (uncensored version)|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzd32_nerd-lap-dance-uncensored-version_music|newspaper=Dailymotion|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422170140/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzd32_nerd-lap-dance-uncensored-version_music|archivedate=April 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was filmed at Mack Sennett Studios in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]].

After being on the site for just under one week, the unrated version of the video was removed from [[YouTube]] on March 30, 2013, citing violations of the site's [[terms of service]] that restricts the uploading of videos containing nudity, particularly if used in a sexual context.&lt;ref name="Blurred Banned"&gt;{{cite news|title='Blurred Lines' Banned By YouTube As Robin Thicke's Video Features Nude Models|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/01/blurred-lines-banned-by-youtube-robin-thicke-nude-models_n_2994676.html|work=''[[Huffington Post]]'' (via the [[Associated Press]])|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was later restored on July 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officially NSFW: YouTube's Naked Lady Problem (NSFW) (Updated)|url=https://gizmodo.com/5993196/officially-nsfw-youtubes-naked-lady-problem|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=April 6, 2013|author=Peter Ha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unrated video remains available on [[Vevo]], while the edited version is available on both Vevo and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Blurred Lines' Banned By YouTube As Robin Thicke's Video Features Nude Models|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/01/blurred-lines-banned-by-youtube-robin-thicke-nude-models_n_2994676.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 6, 2013|date=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gicas|first=Peter|title=Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" Topless Music Video Banned from YouTube|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/403774/robin-thicke-s-blurred-lines-topless-music-video-banned-from-youtube|work=E!

=== Concept and background ===
{{quote box|quote="I wanted to have beautiful bodies and crazy, fucked-up sets. I thought about cheap props, crappy fun stuff. The video is goofy and innocent. I was channeling [[The Benny Hill Show|Benny Hill]] and 1960s variety shows."|source=—Diane Martel Q&amp;A with Eric Ducker, ''Grantland'', June 26, 2013.&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt;|width =25% |align=right}} During a Q&amp;A for ''[[Grantland]]'' Diane Martel explained that her desire was "to make videos that sell records" and "not to make videos that express my own obsessions, but to make videos that move units." Martel at first turned down the offer to direct the video after being told there could be no nudity but agreed to direct when it was decided to shoot two versions. The video was shot as a white [[cyclorama]]. Martel favorably referred to the large hashtags that flash throughout the video as "awkward" and noted she enjoyed their obstructive quality. The fashion in which the women in the video are dressed was in part inspired by the work of photographer [[Helmut Newton]]. When asked about what references she drew from for the video, Martel cited the ballets of [[George Balanchine]] as performed by the [[New York City Ballet]], noting their [[minimalism]], as well as the work of [[Richard Avedon]]. The manner in which Martel directed the action and interaction of those in the video was intended to convey playfulness while also presenting the women "in the power position." Martel also sought out intentionally "gross" and "oversized" props to utilize in the video.&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt;

Critical reactions to ''Blurred Lines'' were mostly positive. ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'''s Jackson Howard graded it an "A" and praised it as "one of Pharrell's best beats in years ... by the time the multilayered and carnal harmonies of the chorus come in, the song is completely on fire."&lt;ref name=howard&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Jackson|title=Single Review: Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' successfully samples classic beats for layered product|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/04single-review-robin-thickes-blurred-lines-successfully-samples-classic-beats-produce-layered-pr04|publisher=''[[The Michigan Daily]]''|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Chris Payne compared it with [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[Suit &amp; Tie]]" and called it a "bubbly bit of disco-shuffling R&amp;B", while also noting its racy content.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Chris|title=R&amp;B Single Review: "Blurred Lines" Robin Thicke|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1558928/rb-single-review-blurred-lines-robin-thicke|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital Spy]]'s Lewis Corner, who gave the song three out of five stars, was more wary of the single and remarked: "It's a subject that when in the right hands can be smooth and soulful, but in the wrong, crass and chauvinistic ... you need the right balance of charm and swagger to pull it off."&lt;ref name=corner&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|title=Robin Thicke ft.

In Canada, the song reached number one for 13 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one single of 2013. Since the launch of the [[Canadian Hot 100]] in 2007, the song has become third with most weeks at number one, tying "[[Apologize (OneRepublic song)|Apologize]]" by [[Timbaland]] featuring [[OneRepublic]], and just behind "[[Uptown Funk]]" by [[Mark Ronson]] featuring [[Bruno Mars]] and "[[I Gotta Feeling]]" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]], with 15 and 16 weeks on top of the charts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Billboard Canadian Hot 100#Songs with most weeks at number one]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Canada's best-selling song of 2013 with 692,000 copies sold (706,000 for all versions combined).&lt;ref name="canada sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/5869529/canadas-digital-music-sales-rise-in-2013-unlike-the-us|title=Canada's Digital Music Sales Rise in 2013 Unlike the U.S.; Eminem, Robin Thicke Among Top Selling Artists|last=Bliss|first=Karen|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=January 11, 2014|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blurred Lines" was confirmed to have sold 1 million copies on its 50th day of release, becoming Pharrell's second song in only a month to achieve that feat in Britain (the other being [[Daft Punk]] collaboration "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]").&lt;ref name="UK million"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/blurred-lines-becomes-uks-latest-million-selling-single-2361/|title=Blurred Lines Becomes UK's Latest Million Selling Single|publisher=officialcharts.com|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Official Charts Company]], the single became Britain's best-selling single of 2013 with sales of 1,472,681 copies.&lt;ref name="uksales2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.musicweek.com/businessanalysis/read/official-charts-analysis-pharrell-williams-hits-no-1-with-106k-sales/057144 |title=Official Charts Analysis: Pharrell Williams hits No.1 with 106k sales |work= Music Week |date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2014, it was announced that "Blurred Lines" was the most downloaded song of all time in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-top-100-most-downloaded-tracks-of-all-time-revealed-2942/|title=The UK's Top 100 most downloaded tracks of all-time revealed!|last=Lane|first=Daniel|date=April 21, 2014|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with digital sales of more than 1.54 million, a total since surpassed by Pharrell Williams' own single "[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]". Its current UK sales stand at 1,630,000.&lt;ref name="top 40 2015" /&gt;

On July 28, 2013, "Blurred Lines" broke the record for radio audience previously held by [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[We Belong Together (Mariah Carey song)|We Belong Together]]" in 2005. A press release from [[Interscope]] said as of the last week in July 2013, the track reached more than 242.65 million listeners.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

''Blurred Lines'' is Thicke's most successful song, being his first to reach number one on the Hot 100 (he previously peaked at number 14 in 2007 with "[[Lost Without U]]"). It also marks Pharrell's third Hot 100 number one, after "[[Drop It Like It's Hot]]" with [[Snoop Dogg]] in 2004 and "[[Money Maker]]" with [[Ludacris]] in 2006, and [[T.I.]]'s fourth Hot 100 number one after "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love"]] with [[Justin Timberlake]] in 2006, and his own singles "[[Whatever You Like (T.I. song)|Whatever You Like]]" and "[[Live Your Life (T.I. song)|Live Your Life]]" in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Thicke Chart History for Billboard Hot 100 Singles|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=robin thicke|chart=Bubbling Under Hot 100}}|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the song topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for twelve consecutive weeks, becoming the longest running number one single of 2013 and of the 2010s decade, surpassing [[Rihanna]]'s "[[We Found Love]]" (2011),&lt;ref name="10 weeks US" /&gt; but was later replaced by [[Mark Ronson]]{{'}}s "[[Uptown Funk]]" in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6517180/uptown-funk-longest-leading-hot-100-no-1-2010s|work=Billboard|title=Uptown Funk Is Longest-Leading Hot 100 No. 1 of the 2010s|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feat also gave him the eighth lead male solo artist in ''Billboard'' history to rack ten or more weeks at the number one spot for a single.&lt;ref name="10 weeks US"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5650672/robin-thicke-leads-hot-100-for-10th-week-katy-perrys-roar-debuts|title=Robin Thicke Leads Hot 100 For 10th Week, Katy Perry's 'Roar' Debuts|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over 5 million copies in just 22 weeks in the US, and 6 million in 29 weeks, faster than any other song in digital history.&lt;ref name="Robin &amp; Marvin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chartwatch2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-oct-13-2013-songs-1-205751307.html |title=Week Ending Oct. 13, 2013.

According to the IFPI, by the end of 2013, the song had sold 14.8 million copies, becoming the best selling song of the year worldwide.

As of August 2016, it is currently the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|seventh best-selling digital single of all time]].

== Controversies ==

=== Content, banning, and subject matter ===
Critics such as Tricia Romano of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote that the song and the [[music video]] trivialize [[sexual consent]]. She asserts that many fans were uncomfortable with both the song and the video. Her article quoted many critics who believe that the song promotes [[rape culture]] because the title "Blurred Lines" and lyrics like "I know you want it" encourage the idea "no doesn't always mean no" and that some [[Rape myth|women who are raped are asking for it]].&lt;ref&gt;Tricia Romano, "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/17/blurred-lines-robin-thicke-s-summer-anthem-is-kind-of-rapey.html 'Blurred Lines,' Robin Thicke's Summer Anthem, Is Kind of Rapey]", ''The Daily Beast'', 17 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism was also leveled at the song's video, which has been labelled "eye-poppingly [[misogynist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/21/renault-weather-duchess-of-cambridge|title=Renault's sexist advert drives me absolutely mad|date=July 21, 2013|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], more than 20 universities banned the song from use at student events.

Jennifer Lai of [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], while noting that the video "undoubtedly objectifies women", countered criticism that the song itself connotes rape by citing lyrics such as "go ahead/get at me" and "So I'm just watchin' and waitin'/ for you to salute the truly pimpin'", among others, in which Robin and T.I. invite the woman's own sexual agency and are "putting the ball in her court".&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; Lai also states:

{{quote|Someone who says "I know you want it" is probably overly cocky and presumptuous as hell by assuming you/she wants "it," but nothing about "I know you want it" is saying "I know you want it, and I'm going to force you to have it" or "I had sex with you and you didn't consent, but I know you wanted it."

Thicke, noting that all three male singers are married and have children, said that the [[Diane Martel]]-directed video was [[tongue-in-cheek]].&lt;ref name="phili" /&gt; When defending the song on NBC's ''[[The Today Show]]'', the 36-year-old singer explained that encouraging conversation about the song's content was his intention, saying "It's actually a feminist movement within itself. It's saying that women and men are equals as animals and as power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpinterest.com/music/uk-universities-ban-robin-thicke-blurred-lines/|title=They Don't Want It:UK Universities Ban – Robin Thicke 'Blurred Lines' – Pulp Interest|work=Pulp Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its banning at University College London, Thicke declared the song was about his wife, and that after 20 years together, he indeed knew she wanted it from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/11/12/robin-thickes-blurred-lines-banned-at-another-british-university/ | work=Time | title=Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' Banned At Another British University – TIME.com | date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2014, Thicke and his wife [[Paula Patton]]'s separation and divorce were covered extensively by the [[tabloid press]] including Thicke's efforts to reconcile with Patton.

During an interview with [[NPR]], "Blurred Lines" producer and co-writer Pharrell defended the song, highlighting the lyric "that man is not your maker", saying, "I don't know anything that could be more clear about our position in the song" and "... if you're looking at the lyrics, the power is right there in the woman's hand. That man—me as a human being, me as a man, I'm not your maker, I can't tell you what to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/12/31/258406317/pharrell-williams-on-juxtaposition-and-seeing-sounds |title=Pharrell Williams On Juxtaposition And Seeing Sounds |work=npr.org |date= December 31, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharrell reiterated and expounded on his defense during an interview with [[Pitchfork Media]], in response to the idea of the song being "sexually predatory", saying:

{{quote|What would be controversial about it? In "Blurred Lines", the Robin Thicke lyrics are: "You don't need no papers," meaning, "You are not a possession." "That man is not your maker," meaning he is not God—nor can he produce children or women, for that matter. He's a man, so he definitely did not make you...What I was trying to say was: "That man is trying to domesticate you, but you don't need no papers—let me liberate you." But it was misconstrued. When you pull back and look at the entire song, the point is: She's a good girl, and even good girls want to do things, and that's where you have the blurred lines. She expresses it in dancing because she's a good girl. People who are agitated just want to be mad, and I accept their opinion... We got a kick out of making people dance, and that was the intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Battan| first = Carrie| title = Pharrell Williams|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9343-pharrell/| publisher = Pitchfork.com| date = February 28, 2014 | accessdate = March 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a Q&amp;A for Grantland.com, video director Diane Martel had this to say about the music video:

{{quote|I wanted to deal with the misogynist, funny lyrics in a way where the girls were going to overpower the men. Look at [[Emily Ratajkowski]]'s performance; it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing. That's what is fresh to me. It also forces the men to feel playful and not at all like predators. I directed the girls to look into the camera, this is very intentional and they do it most of the time; they are in the power position. I don't think the video is sexist. The lyrics are ridiculous, the guys are silly as fuck. That said, I respect women who are watching out for negative images in pop culture and who find the nudity offensive, but I find [the video] meta and playful.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{Citation | last = Ducker| first = Eric| title = Q&amp;A: Veteran Music Video Director Diane Martel on Her Controversial Videos for Robin Thicke and Miley Cyrus|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/qa-veteran-music-video-director-diane-martel-on-her-controversial-videos-for-robin-thicke-and-miley-cyrus/| publisher = Grantland.com| date = June 26, 2013 | accessdate = February 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thicke at first appears to contradict his claims that the song is about women empowerment in an interview given to ''[[GQ]]'' in May 2013, stating:

{{quote|We tried to do everything that was taboo. Bestiality, drug injections, and everything that is completely derogatory towards women. Because all three of us are happily married with children, we were like, "We're the perfect guys to make fun of this." People say, "Hey, do you think this is degrading to women?" I'm like, "Of course it is. What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman. I've never gotten to do that before. I've always respected women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/05/robin-thicke-interview-blurred-lines-music-video-collaborating-with-2-chainz-and-kendrick-lamar-mercy.html |title=Robin Thicke on That Banned Video, Collaborating with 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar, and His New Film  |work=gq.com |date= May 7, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked about this, Diane Martel denied that there was any such intention calling the idea that it was ever discussed and Thicke's ''GQ'' statement "crazy".&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt; Thicke later clarified his comment during an interview for ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]'', describing it as a "bad joke", noting that the ''GQ'' interview that was published did not mention that he had been joking back and forth with the interviewer and doing an impersonation of [[Will Ferrell]]'s [[Ron Burgundy]] character while making the remark, thus not providing the facetious context.&lt;ref name=Oprah&gt;[http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/robin-thicke-robin-thicke-on-oprah-s-next-chapter-video.20205.html Oprah Winfrey.''Oprah's Next Chapter''.Season 2, Episode 39, ''Robin Thicke''].2013. Television. Approx. at the 17min 30sec mark. via hotnewhiphop.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for [[CBC Radio]]'s ''Q'', Thicke dismissed the idea that the song is about a man forcing himself sexually onto a woman as "an impossible reality".&lt;ref name=CBCRadio /&gt; Thicke continues, "For them to take that lyric [''I know you want it''] and not take the lyrics ''that man is not your maker, you're an animal'', and we're equals, and all of the other lyrics that are in the song and only to take ''I know you want it'' from a guy like Ron Burgundy who's standing there going, [does impression of Ron Burgundy] 'I know you want it, baby'. It's a joke. If they can't get the joke, I feel bad for them, but I'm not going to change the joke."&lt;ref name=CBCRadio /&gt;

In the interview, Thicke noted that part of video director Diane Martel's intention was to generate attention, but Thicke defended the song, saying: "The song and the video are two completely different things. The song has nothing to do with belittling a woman or misogyny or anything. Obviously, when a guy's standing there fully clothed and the girls are naked, I totally welcome the conversation of what does this video say about men and women, but the song itself, the title, 'Blurred Lines', is about men and woman are equals."&lt;ref name=CBCRadio&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.cbc.ca/q/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2400735917|title=Robin Thicke defends Blurred Lines and being 'naughty'|series=Q |credits= Interviewer:Stephen Quinn|network=CBC Radio|airdate= August 14, 2013|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marvin Gaye lawsuit and authorship questions ===

In August 2013, Thicke, Williams, and Harris (T.I.) sued the family of [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Bridgeport Music]] for a declaratory judgment that "Blurred Lines" did not [[copyright infringement|infringe copyrights]] of the defendants. Gaye's family accused the song's authors of copying the "feel" and "sound" of "Got to Give It Up" (the song that Thicke personally claimed was an influence on "Blurred Lines"), while Bridgeport claimed that the song illegally sampled [[Funkadelic]]'s song "Sexy Ways". The litigation over the songs drew comparisons to that of the 1970s case between [[George Harrison]] and Bright Tunes Music over the song "[[My Sweet Lord]]", which a judge ruled had similarly plagiarized the earlier "[[He's So Fine]]" by [[The Chiffons]]; Harrison later bought the rights to "He's So Fine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/plagiarism-robin-thicke-my-sweet-lord-music-pharrell-williams-313178 |title=Your Favorite Band Probably Plagiarized More Than ‘Blurred Lines’ |newspaper=[[Newsweek]] |date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Thicke and Williams (but not T.I.) were found to have infringed the Gaye estate's copyright, and in 2018 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] affirmed liability for millions of dollars in damages.&lt;ref name=Forbes2018&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriennegibbs/2018/03/21/marvin-gaye-wins-blurred-lines-lawsuit-pharrell-robin-thicke-t-i-off-hook/|title=Marvin Gaye's Family Wins 'Blurred Lines' Appeal; Pharrell, Robin Thicke Must Pay |first= Adrienne|last= Gibbs|date= March 23, 2018|access-date= April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics make fun of the stereotype of the rowdy male Asian-Indian teenage boy. As pointed to by its title, the lyrics also mock and refute the sexist attitudes of the original song.

[[Rucka Rucka Ali]] has created his own parody, entitled "Obama Been Watching" which satirizes, among other things, the [[NSA]] and [[Edward Snowden]].

On July 15, 2014, [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] released a parody of the song entitled "[[Word Crimes]]" from his album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]''.&lt;ref name=sticker&gt;{{cite web|title=CD Promo Sticker|url=http://i.imgur.com/bEKk0cN.jpg|accessdate=July 10, 2014|date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video was released online the same day.&lt;ref name="rs word crimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-shows-off-big-dictionary-in-robin-thicke-parody-word-crimes-20140715 | title = Weird Al Shows Off Big Dictionary in Robin Thicke Parody 'Word Crimes' | first = Jon | last = Blisten | date = July 15, 2014 | accessdate = July 15, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|8Gv0H-vPoDc|"Weird Al" Yankovic - Word Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2014, Glove and Boots, a production of [[Bento Box Entertainment]], published a comedic recap of the legal dispute in the form of a music video parody entitled "A Brief History of Robin Thicke's 2013 Summer Hit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Robin Thicke's 2013 Summer Hit | url=http://www.gloveandboots.com/?p=348 | accessdate=September 24, 2014 | date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cledus T. Judd]], who is primarily a country music parodist, released a parody in November 2014 titled "[[Luke Bryan]]", which features guest vocals from [[Colt Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2014/11/cledus-t-judd-releases-new-parody-single-luke-bryan/|title=Cledus T.

=== Media ===
In Chile, the song was used on [[Via X]]'s TV show ''Super Bueno'' and [[Zona Latina]]'s ''No eres tu soy yo''; it was also included in the soundtrack of TV soap opera ''[[Somos Los Carmona]]'', and was featured on TV adverts from Chilean department store chain [[La Polar]].

The song appears in the video games [[NBA 2K14]] and [[Just Dance 2014]].

On July 23, 2013, the [[YouTube]] channel [[Barack's Dubs]] uploaded a mashup video of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] singing the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU3CYs77Ku4|title=Bill Clinton Singing Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke|date=23 July 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was featured in both the TV ads and theatrical trailer for the 2013 film ''[[The Best Man Holiday]]''.

The song was featured in an episode of the [[Two and a Half Men (season 11)|11th season]] of the hit [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', sang by the character Walden Schmidt (played by [[Ashton Kutcher]]).

It has been used as the first song on several radio stations flipping to CHR or similar formats, most recently on March 31, 2014, when [[CKZZ-FM]] in Vancouver, BC, Canada, rebranded from ''Virgin Radio 95.3'' back to their original name as ''Z95.3''.

In Poland, the song was used on ''[[Taniec z Gwiazdami (season 15)|Taniec z Gwiazdami]]'' (Polish version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' format) [[Taniec z Gwiazdami (season 15)|15th season]]'s trailer in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jastrzabpost.pl/newsy/spot-tanca-gwiazdami-rytmie-przeboju-blurred-lines-zobacz-sie-prezentuja-pary-wideo_32734.html|title=SPOT "TAŃCA Z GWIAZDAMI" W RYTMIE PRZEBOJU "BLURRED LINES"!

The song was played before the end of the special episode of ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' entitled ''Sa Tamang Panahon'' performed by [[Jose Manalo]] as Frankie with thanking the sponsors in October 24, 2015 at the [[Philippine Arena]].

In Albania contestant Kastro imitated Robin on the Albanian version of [[Your Face Sounds Familiar (Albanian TV Series)]]

The distributors issued four posters, [[Mao Zedong]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], and [[Joseph Stalin]].

A '''caveman''' is a [[stock character]] representative of primitive man in the [[Paleolithic]]. The popularisation of the type dates to the early 20th century, when [[Neanderthal Man]] was influentially described as "simian" or ape-like by [[Marcellin Boule]] and [[Arthur Keith]].

While knowledge of human evolution in the Pleistocene has become much more detailed, the stock character has persisted, even though it anachronistically conflates characteristics of [[archaic humans]] and [[European early modern humans|early modern humans]].

The term "caveman" has its taxonomical equivalent in the now-obsolete ''[[Homo troglodytes]]'' ("cave-dwelling man", [[Linnaeus]] 1758).

==Characteristics==

Cavemen are typically portrayed as wearing shaggy animal hides, and capable of cave painting like [[behaviorally modern humans]] of the [[last glacial period]]. Anachronistically, they are simultaneously shown armed with rocks or cattle bone clubs, unintelligent, and aggressive. [[Popular culture]] also frequently represents cavemen as living with or alongside [[dinosaur]]s, even though non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the [[Cretaceous period]], 66 million years before the emergence of the ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' species.

The image of them living in caves arises from the fact that caves are where the preponderance of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found from European [[Stone Age]] cultures, although this most likely reflects the degree of preservation that caves provide over the millennia rather than an indication of their typical form of shelter. Until the last glacial period, most{{clarify|date=September 2015}} [[Hominini|hominins]] did not live in caves, being nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes living in a variety of temporary structures, such as tents&lt;ref&gt;Jerry D. Moore, "The Prehistory of Home", University of California Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and wooden huts (e.g. at [[Ohalo]]). Their societies were similar to those of many modern day [[indigenous peoples]]. A few genuine cave dwellings did exist, however, such as at [[Mount Carmel]] in Israel.{{Citation needed|date = September 2016}}

Stereotypical cavemen have traditionally been depicted wearing smock-like garments made of animal skin and held up by a shoulder strap on one side, and carrying large clubs approximately conical in shape.  They often have grunt-like names, such as Ugg and Zog.

==History==
[[File:Caveman 5.jpg|thumb|150px|Cave family at a meal, illustration by Irma Deremeaux for ''[[The Cave Boy of the Age of Stone]]'' (1907)]]

Caveman-like heraldic "[[wild man|wild men]]" were found in European and African iconography for hundreds of years. During the [[Middle Ages]], these creatures were generally depicted in art and literature as bearded and covered in hair, and often wielding [[club (weapon)|clubs]] and dwelling in caves. While wild men were always depicted as living outside of civilization, there was an ongoing debate as to whether they were human or animal.

In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1912), ape-men are depicted in a fight with modern humans. [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] adapted this idea for ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' (1918). A genre of caveman movies emerged, typified by [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Man's Genesis]]'' (1912); they inspired [[Charles Chaplin]]'s satiric take,&lt;ref&gt;Stills from [http://kissofthebeast.com/film_program/20_november/mans_genesis ''Man's Genesis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054133/http://kissofthebeast.com/film_program/20_november/mans_genesis |date=2008-07-20 }} and [http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/resources/bfi/filmog/film_thumb.php?fid=59421&amp;resource=Stills ''His Prehistoric Past''] show that Chaplin still has his bowler hat.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[His Prehistoric Past]]'' (1914) as well as ''[[Brute Force (1914 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1914), ''[[The Cave Man]]'' (1912), and later ''[[Cave Man (film)|Cave Man]]'' (1934). From the descriptions, Griffith's characters cannot talk, and use sticks and stones for weapons, while the hero of ''Cave Man'' is a [[Tarzanesque]] figure who fights dinosaurs.

[[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Brute Force (1914 film)|Brute Force]]'', a silent film released in 1914, represents one of the earliest portrayals of cavemen and dinosaurs together; more recent examples include the comic strip ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C.]]'' and the television series ''[[The Flintstones]]''.

The anachronistic combination of cavemen with [[dinosaur]]s itself became a humorous stereotype.
The [[comic strips]] ''[[B.C. (comic)|B.C.]]'', ''[[Alley Oop]]'', the Spanish comic franchise ''[[Mortadelo y Filemón]]'', and occasionally ''[[The Far Side]]'' and ''[[Gogs]]'' portray "cavemen" with dinosaurs. [[Gary Larson]], in his ''[[The Prehistory of the Far Side]]'', stated he once felt that he needed to confess his cartooning sins in this regard: "O Father, I Have Portrayed Primitive Man and Dinosaurs In The Same Cartoon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larson |first1=Gary |authorlink1=Gary Larson |title=The Prehistory of The Far Side |date=1989 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |isbn=0-8362-1851-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[animated series]] ''[[The Flintstones]]'', a spoof on family sitcoms, portrays the Flintstones even using dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals as tools, household appliances, vehicles, and construction machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=30 September 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html |first=Heidi |last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypical cavemen are also often featured in advertising, including advertisements for [[Minute Maid]].{{year needed|date=May 2018}} 
In early 2004, [[GEICO]] launched a series of television commercials and attempts at [[viral marketing]], collectively known as the [[GEICO Cavemen]] advertising campaign, where GEICO announcers are repeatedly denounced by modern cavemen for perpetuating a stereotype of unintelligent, backward cavemen. The GEICO advertisements spawned a short-lived TV series called ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]''.

In the United States in the nineteenth century, German and Irish immigrants shipped trees from Michigan and Wisconsin down to Chicago via boat to satisfy the large demand for [[Christmas tree]]s.&lt;ref name=maloney&gt;Cathy Jean Maloney, ''Chicago Gardens: The Early History''. p. 326.

Christmas tree shipping continued to occur in Chicago into the 1930s.&lt;ref name=maloney/&gt; Ships laden with Christmas gifts for distribution were also referred to as "Christmas ships" in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1902/12/18/archives/christmas-ships-sail-the-oceanic-and-st-paul-due-in-england-dec-24.html CHRISTMAS SHIPS SAIL; The Oceanic and St. Paul Due in England Dec. 24.]. ''[[New York Times]]'', December 18, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; even inspiring a popular [[World War I]]-era song, "[[Hurrah! Hurrah for the Christmas Ship]]".

[[Seattle, Washington]] held its first Christmas ship parade in 1941, but without any lights on the boats due to [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] regulations during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=baines&gt;Doris Baines, ''Christmas: Traditions and Legends''. 1997, p. 156.

A lead boat travels to waterfront destinations on [[Lake Washington]] and in [[Puget Sound]], and a choral group on the boat sings a program of [[Christmas carols]] to the audience on shore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.king5.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/evening/celebrate-the-holidays-aboard-argosy-cruises-christmas-ship/495024860?scroll=0 Celebrate the holidays aboard Argosy Cruises Christmas Ship].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23745">The '''Club Kids''' was a group of young [[New York City]] dance club personalities led by [[Michael Alig]] and [[James St. James]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group was notable for its members' flamboyant behavior and outrageous costumes. In 1988, writer [[Michael Musto]] wrote about the Club Kids' "cult of crazy fashion and petulance": "They ... are terminally superficial, have dubious aesthetic values, and are master manipulators, exploiters, and, thank God, partiers."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/ny-mirror-6414027|title=NY Mirror|last=Musto|first=Michael|date=2002-03-26|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doonan, Simon"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Observer|url=http://observer.com/1999/08/club-kids-on-the-skids-the-horrid-lovely-alig-epic/|title=Club Kids on the Skids: The Horrid, Lovely Alig Epic|author=Doonan, Simon|date=August 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was also recognized as an artistic and fashion-conscious youth culture. They were a definitive force in New York City's underground club culture at the time. Several Club Kids have made long-lasting contributions to mainstream art and fashion. According to former Club Kid "Walt Paper" Cassidy, "The nightclub for me was like a laboratory, a place where you were encouraged and rewarded for experimentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Raven (Ed.)|date=2008 |title=Club Kids: From Speakeasies to Boombox and Beyond|location= London, UK|publisher=Black Dog Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alig and numerous followers began heavy drug use. He began adding drug dealers to the Club Kids roster and Peter Gatien's payroll, and increasing numbers of Club Kids became addicted to drugs.&lt;ref name="Kurtis, Bill Host 2000"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kurtis, Bill (Host)|date=2000|title=Dancing, Drugs, and Murder|work= American Justice ''(Series 126)''|location= New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent chroniclers of the Club Kids culture==

==History==
Alig moved to [[New York City|NYC]] from his hometown—[[South Bend, Indiana]]—in 1984 and began hosting small events. In 1987, he supplanted [[Andy Warhol]] as a leading New York partier; in an'' [[Interview Magazine]] ''article, Alig said: "We were all going to become Warhol Superstars and move into The Factory. The funny thing was that everybody had the same idea: not to dress up but to make fun of people who dressed up. We changed our names like they did, and we dressed up in outrageously crazy outfits in order to be a satire of them—only we ended up becoming what we were satirizing."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-comeback-kid-michael-aligs-return-to-new-york-nightlife|title=The Comeback Kid: Michael Alig’s Return to New York Nightlife |newspaper=Thump|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club Kids' aesthetic emphasized outrageousness, "fabulousness", and sex. Gender was [[Gender fluid|fluid]], and everything was [[DIY]]. In Musto's words: "It was a statement of individuality and sexuality which ran the gamut, and it was a form of tapping into an inner fabulousness within themselves and bringing it out."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/05/02/michael-musto-on-the-prevailing-influence-of-club-kid-fashion|title=Michael Musto on the Prevailing Influence of Club Kid Fashion|website=The FADER|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the group's influence grew, they spread from the back rooms of lesser-known clubs to venues such as [[Area (nightclub)|Area]], Rudolf Piper's iconic [[Danceteria]], and the [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]]. From there, Alig and his gang went on to virtually run [[Peter Gatien]]'s club network, including the notorious Club USA, Palladium, Tunnel, and [[The Limelight]], a large [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] club in a [[deconsecrated]] church. To draw crowds into these venues, Alig and the Club Kids began holding guerilla-style "outlaw parties", where, fully costumed and ready to party, they would hijack locations like [[Burger King]], Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, ATM vestibules, the old [[High Line]] tracks before their conversion to a park, and the [[New York City Subway]] blasting music from a [[boombox]] and dancing until the police cleared them out. Alig even "threw a party in a cardboard shantytown rented from its homeless inhabitants",&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Michelle"/&gt; whom he paid with cash and crack cocaine.&lt;ref name="Bollen, Christopher"/&gt; He ensured that such events always happened in the vicinity of an actual club to which the group could decamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/party_monster_new_michael_alig_prison_interview|title=Party Monster: New Michael Alig prison interview|date=2010-05-08|newspaper=DangerousMinds|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; At the height of their cultural popularity, the Club Kids toured the United States (throwing parties, "certifying" those clubs for inclusion in the Club Kids network,  and recruiting new members&lt;ref name="Bollen, Christopher"/&gt;), and appeared on several talk shows, including ''[[Geraldo]]'', ''[[Joan Rivers|The Joan Rivers Show]]'', and the ''[[Phil Donahue Show]]''.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/michael-alig/#_|title=Michael Alig|newspaper=Interview Magazine|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Carrie S.|title=the joan rivers show – club kids interview|date=2006-02-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAm1RcsCOEg|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=theflush|title=New York Club Kids on Phil Donahue talkshow|date=1993|work=Donahue 1993 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llnSZqNGJtk|accessdate=2017-01-31}} (Complete TV show.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the movement's decline was marked by an event on Sunday, March 17, 1996, when Alig and his roommate Robert "Freeze" Riggs killed former [[The Limelight|Limelight]] employee and reputed drug dealer [[Andre Melendez|Andre "Angel" Melendez]]. After nine months, Alig and Riggs were arrested.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Post|author=Alig, Michael|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/12/party-monster-relives-catfight-that-ended-in-murder/|title=Club Kid killer relives bloody crime|date=May 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group dissipated in the mid-1990s after Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s "Quality of Life" crackdown on Manhattan's nightclubs.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

'''''Cubist Still Life with Lemons''''' (sometimes '''''Still Life with Lemons''''') is a 1975 painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]].

Lichtenstein had a period of experimentation with [[still life]] painting from 1974 to 1976. Measuring 228.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 172.7&amp;nbsp;cm (90 in × 68 in), ''Still Life with Lemons'' represented a take on still life from the [[Cubist]] perspective, with Lichtenstein using many favorite Cubist motifs: "...pitcher, bowl of fruit, and faux wood grain - with some of his own, such as sections of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue, portions of an entablature, and a pattern of diagonal stripes."&lt;ref name=RLR41&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Reflections|author=Waldman, Diane|publisher=Electa|year=1999|isbn=88-435-7287-3|page=41|quote=From 1974 to 1976, Lichtenstein experimented with a variety of approaches to still life. In ''Still Life with Lemons'', 1975, he combined some of the [[Cubist]]s' favorite motifs - pitcher, bowl of fruit, and faux wood grain - with some of his own, such as sections of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue, portions of an entablature, and a pattern of diagonal stripes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has an element of three-dimensionality due to its overlapping planes and reflection, although this still life series was meant to look flat.&lt;ref name=RLR43&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Reflections|author=Waldman, Diane|publisher=Electa|year=1999|isbn=88-435-7287-3|page=43|quote=...the earlier series is meant to look traditional &amp;ndash; that is, three-dimensional &amp;ndash; while this series was meant to look flat. In ''Still Life with Lemons'', however, there is just the hint of volume created by the overlapping planes of the image and by the reflection in the red form located behind the pitcher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jack Cowart, "...The scale of Lichtenstein's [Cubist still life] work is antithetical to the primarily intimate and more closely related nature of real Cubism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lichtenstein: Roy Lichtenstein 1970&amp;ndash;1980|author=Cowart, Jack|year=1981|publisher=Hudson Hills Press, Inc.|isbn=0-933920-14-8|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elastolin''' is a trademark used by the German company O&amp;M Hausser (O&amp;M Haußer) for the [[toy soldiers]] and other types of figures it manufactured from [[composite material]] and later from plastic. The Hausser firm was founded in 1904 by Christian Hausser and his sons Otto and Max. The factory was situated in [[Ludwigsburg]] near [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elastolin.nl/pagina57.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scales of figures==

Elastolin composition figures were manufactured in 40mm (also known as 4-cm), 65mm (6.5-cm), 70mm (7-cm), and 105mm (10.5&amp;nbsp;cm) scales. Since 70-mm is approximately 3-inches, a 70-mm figure is approximately 1/24 scale. The Elastolin catalogs of the 1930s describe the 7-cm figures as being "normal size" (''normalgrosse'') and the 4-cm figures as ''Miniatur-Soldaten''. The catalog numbers for the 4-cm figures began with the preface M so the catalog number for a 4-cm marching ''Heer Trommler'' (Army snare drummer) was M 47/1.

Production of all figures (and all other toys) ended after the German economy was put on a "[[total war]]" footing in 1943.

==Heer==

The ''Heer'', all wearing correct the [[World War II German uniform]], was represented by [[Military parade|parade]] ground figures that included marching officers, marching infantry men, marching [[Standard-bearer|flag-carrier]]s, marching musicians, a marching ''[[panzer]]'' man in his distinctive black uniform, marching ''[[Gebirgsjager]]'' ("mountain troops"), marching musicians, and cavalry and musicians mounted on horses. The [[parade ground]] figures had troops for a [[guard mounting]] that included officers standing at attention, enlisted personnel standing at attention or at "[[Present arms (command)|present arms]]", standing flag-carriers, a ''panzer'' man saluting, standing musicians, and [[sentry box]]es as well as standing cavalry and standing cavalry musicians.

There was a figure of a [[drill instructor]] and three figures of new recruits in fatigue uniform doing [[Military education and training|training exercises]].

''Heer'' combat troops included ''Infanterie'' (series 500/- and 600/-) (riflemen, grenade throwers and machine gun teams), ''Kavallerie'' (series 400/-), ''Artillerie'' [series 664/-] (crewmen for the tinplate artillery pieces), ''Nachrichtentruppe'' ("communications troops") [series 659/-] which included World War I-vintage message dog- and carrier-pigeon-wranglers, ''Pioniere'' ("combat engineer and construction troops") [series 662/-] and ''Krad-Schutzen'' ("motorcycle troops") [series 990/-] on individual two-passenger motorcycles and three-passenger sidecar models.

[[Poison gas]] had been used by both sides on the Western Front during World War I, and so there was a ''Gasalarmschlager'' ("gas alarm striker") [584] and several ''Infanterie'' figures wearing gas masks.

The ''Verwundete und Sanitatspersonal'' (series 656) included doctors and nurses to treat the assortment of wounded soldiers that the [[Combat medic|medic]] figures brought back from the battlefield. Series 656 also included a ''Toter Soldat'' ("dead soldier") [652/15].

''Lagerleben'' ("camp life") [series 550/-] was represented by soldiers washing, cleaning, eating or simply lying around and their [[tent]]s. There was also figure 550/36/50, a unit clerk who came ready to work with his own table, bench and [[typewriter]].

==Kriegsmarine==

The ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' was represented by a "personality" figure of ''Großadmiral'' [[Erich Raeder]] saluting, marching officers carrying swords, sailors carrying rifles, marching fanfare trumpeters (''Fanfarenblaser'') and flag-carriers (''Fahnentrager'') and a short set of combat figures. There are two basic sets of marching figures -— one set wears the blue winter uniform and the other wears the white summer uniform. Complete sets of marching musicians were produced for both of the seasonal colors. There are also marching sailors wearing white shirts and blue trousers. The set of ''Kriegsmarine'' combat figures includes standing, kneeling and prone riflemen, a charging rifleman, a charging officer, a rifleman swinging his rifle like a club, and a grenade thrower. All Elastolin ''Kriegsmarine'' figures of the III. Reich era (1933–1945) are cataloged in series 14/-- (The catalog number for a marching ''Kriegsmarine Trommler'' [snare drummer] was 14/47/1, with 14 indicating the branch of service; the second number, 47, indicated that the figure was a marching musician, and the final number, 1, indicated that the musician was a ''Trommler'').

==Luftwaffe==

The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was represented on the parade ground by several different "personality" figures of ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann Göring]], and two series of marching figures: ''Flieger'' ("fliers") [series 26/-] with yellow ''[[waffenfarbe]]'' ("arm of service color") and ''Flak'' ("anti-aircraft troops) [series 28/-] with red ''waffenfarbe.'' Both branches were represented by several types of marching officers, marching enlisted personnel with rifles (some wearing the soft field cap, others wearing the iconic ''stahlhelm'' helmet), marching flag-carriers, and complete sets of marching and standing musicians. ''Fliegers'' and ''Flak'' alike were also represented by standing (non-marching) officers and enlisted men.

The marching ''Fliegers'' also included an aircrewman wearing a beige "[[flight suit]]" instead of the blue ''Luftwaffe'' uniform.

The ''Luftwaffe'' also had combat troops. There were 28/664 series ''Flak-Artillerie'' crews and 28/590 ''Flak-Krad-Schutzen'' figures. These figures were the same as their ''Heer'' counterparts but with the distinctive blue-gray uniform of the ''Luftwaffe''. Elastolin solf them sold for the same price as their ''Heer'' counterparts, but modern auction catalogs usually list them at higher prices and modern day collectors must therefore take care that any 28/664 and 28/590 figures they buy are not post-war repaints of the regular 664 and 590 figures.

==Paramilitary==

The paramilitary units include the SA (''Sturm Abteilung''), the SS, the [[LSSAH]] (''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler'' = Hitler's elite SS bodyguard unit), the RAD (''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' = German Labor Service), [[NSDAP]] (the Nazi party),  Hitler Youth (''Hitler Jugend''), ''Jungvolk'' (pre-teen counterpart of the Hitler Youth), BdM (female counterpart of the Hitler Youth), ''Marinesturm'' (Marine-SA; a specialized sub-unit of the SA), and several others.

All the paramilitary organizations were represented by marching figures. There were complete marching bands of SA, SS and RAD musicians; also a complete band of standing (non-marching) SA musicians that included a ''kesselpauker'' (kettle drummer). The ''Jungfolk'' were represented by marching drummers, flautists and ''fanfarenblaser''.

There were SA, SS, LSSAH, RAD, Hitler Youth, ''Jungvolk'', BdM and NSFK marching figures carrying either the German national flag or the flag of their individual organization.

The SA had been the largest and most visible of the Nazi paramilitary organizations in the 1920s and on into the 1930s, and so it is not surprising that Elastolin made many types of SA figures. There SA figures in several types of uniforms—the basic "brown shirt," another uniform with a brown jacket, and a winter uniform. The SA marchers included men carrying packs, and men with slung rifles. The parade figures also included an SA medic and an SA nurse—quick "first aid" (at the least) was often important during the ''Kampfzeit'' ("time of battle/struggle") before Hitler was appointed chancellor!

There were also figures on horseback, and a small group of mounted SA musicians.

Stepping outside the parade ground, there was an extensive line of SA ''Lagerleben'' figures and others representing a unit undergoing field training.

==Personality figures==
The first "personality figures" Hausser producer were Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and soon after ''Feldmarschall'' [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenburg]] during World War I.

The "personality figures" include Hitler, [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenburg]], [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]], Göring, Hess, Goebbels, [[Baldur von Schirach|von Schirach]], ''Großadmiral'' [[Erich Raeder|Raeder]], and ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] in [[Hussar]] uniform. There are also two personality figures of Mussolini and one of Franco. A personality figure of SA leader [[Ernst Röhm]] was dropped from the line after he was executed during the so-called "[[Night of the Long Knives]]" (a purge of the socialist wing of the Nazi party) in 1934. The figure of General [[Werner von Blomberg|von Blomberg]] became a generic General figure after he was forced to retire in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toy-soldier-gallery.com/Articles/Personalities/Personalities3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was represented by several uniformed figures; one was a walking figure of Hitler reviewing troops or perhaps a Nazi unit with his right arm up in his unique bent-arm salute. There was also a seated Hitler to ride in one of Elastolin's magnificent staff cars (German children knew the Führer always sat up front next to the driver and ''never'' in the back seat). There was also an early figure of Hitler in civilian attire.

Göring's high profile in the German leadership was reflected by the fact that he too was represented by figures showing him in SA, NSFK and Luftwaffe uniform. There was a walking figure (26/21) of Goring reviewing troops, and as Goring was promoted to ''Generalfeldmarschall'' and then to the unique rank of  ''Reichsmarschall'' a figure was produced that showed "the Iron Man" holding an appropriately large ''[[Field Marshal|marschall']]s'' [[Baton (military)|baton]].

Premium grade figures of Hitler, Göring, Hindenburg, Mussolini and Franco were made with headless composition bodies that were then fitted with special-made porcelain heads that captured their facial features and expressions with exceptional clarity. These command premium prices from collectors.

Mussolini was available as a walking figure (25/21N) and sitting astride a horse (25/496N). ''Generalfeldmarshall und Reichspresident'' von Hindenburg was still in the catalog for several years after his death in 1934 and was available in uniform (649), in civilian attire (648), and in uniform astride a horse.

All of the Nazi leaders (Hitler, Röhm, Heß, Göring, Goebbels and von Schirach) were represented by at least one figure with a movable right arm that could be raised and positioned in the ''German greeting'' (aka the "Heil Hitler!" salute). The figures of Mussolini and Franco also had arms could also positioned in the Fascist-style salute (In contrast, ''Wehrmacht'' figures saluted/"greeted" each other with the traditional right-hand-touching-cap/helmet salute).

==Foreign (''Ausländer'') forces==

The foreign (''Ausländer'') armed services were also well represented. These include English, American, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, Ethiopian, French, Swiss, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, (British) Indian, Chinese and Japanese.

The French forces include the French Army (marching and combat figures), marching French sailors, marching French colonial forces ("French" and "native"), and a short line of the elite ''[[chasseurs alpins]]'' (mountain troops). The Belgians were represented by infantry—marching figures and combat figures; there was also a short line of figures wearing the distinctive green beret of the [[Chasseurs Ardennais|Ardennes Rifle Corps]].

The Italians were represented by marching infantry and several combat figures; there were also marching officers and men of the elite ''[[bersaglieri]]'' rifle units with their broad-brimmed hats and black cockerel feathers. Italian figures in tropical uniforms, and (black) African colonial soldiers were produced in small numbers.

[[Guards Regiment]]s in colourful [[dress uniform]]s were produced of Great Britain's [[Grenadier Guards]] and Denmark's [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]].

Hausser-Elastolin made most of its foreign figures by adding a head with the correct helmet to a headless conventional body and then painting the figure accordingly. That is why English, American and French soldiers are armed with German-style [[Model 24 grenade|"potato masher" hand grenade]]s rather than the Allied [[Mk 2 grenade|"pineapple" hand grenade]], and why they carry a standard German gas mask canister. However, there are also some foreign figures that were made from special castings—those of Belgian and French soldiers wearing long greatcoats being the best example.

Several other European nations took note of the greater protection afforded by the German ''[[stahlhelm]]'' design and used it for their own forces. This made it possible for  Elastolin to create figures representing some foreign armies simply by painting standard German figures with German heads in the color(s) of a foreign uniform. Therefore, it is helpful to have a good reference book such as [[Andrew Mollo]]'s ''The Armed Forces of World War II'' to correctly identify them—particularly when distinguishing between German, Hungarian and Swiss personnel.

==Other Hausser-Elastolin figures from the 1930s==
The Hausser-Elastolin line of the 1930s was not limited to the military and paramilitary units of the time. There was also an extensive line of cowboys and Indians (the cowboys sometimes known as "trappers" in Germany), a shorter line of medieval knights and foot soldiers (''Ritterfiguren''), and a short line of Prussian and Austrian figures from the 18th-century wars of Frederick the Great (''Friedrich der Grosse'') that included personality figures of "der alte Fritz" (0/7/20) and two of his generals—Seydlitz (0/7/21) and Ziethen (0/7/22). The figure of a Prussian drummer with a black (African) face (figure 0/7/47/1M) is correct; there was an African drummer in the Prussian army at that time, however such a figure should be checked carefully with a "black light" to make sure that it is not a post-war repaint.

There was an extensive lines of wild animals (''menagerie-und-jagdtiere'') and farm animals (''haustiere''), and also a line of more than 30 civilian figures for use with electric trains (''Eisenbahn-Figuren'').  The latter included DRB (''Deutsche Reichsbahn'' = German Railway) workers, station workers such as luggage carriers, and passengers; they were produced primarily in 7-cm (''Normalgroße'') although some were also available in 5-cm and 3-cm sizes.

==Accessories==

Hausser produced log cabin forts for the cowboys, castles/fortresses for the knights, houses and barns for the farmers and their animals, zoo enclosures for the wild animals, and an assortment of trench pieces and bunkers (''Schutzengraben aus Holz'') that allowed piece-by-piece purchase and assembly of multi-line trench systems for the soldiers. These included artillery emplacements, command bunkers, a [[field kitchen]] and a first aid station.

There was an equally extensive line of tin plate military wagons (including a [[field kitchen]] and a field bakery), trucks, [[half-track]]s, [[searchlight]]s and artillery pieces. Some of the 1920s vintage models were rather generic in design, but some of the later models were accurate scale models of their real-life counterparts—the 721-1/2 ''leichtes Inf.-Geschutz'' ("light infantry cannon"), 726 ''schweres Langrohrgeschutz'' ("heavy long-barreled cannon"), 710 ''Schwere Feldhaubitze'' ("heavy field howitzer") and the 744 ''Panzer-Spahwagen'' ("armored scout wagen" = armored car) in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.toy-soldier-gallery.com/Index.cgi?action=source&amp;source=details&amp;id=29&amp;page=12 Hausser Elastolin Catalogue 1939/40&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastolin added play action value to these toys in several ways. Several of the motor vehicles had battery-powered electric motors that propelled them across the tin plate battlefield with functional electric headlights lighting the way; the truck-mounted and stationary search lights were also functional. The ''Nachrichtentruppe'' figure series included "radio groups" equipped with batteries that allowed messages to be sent and received in Morse code. Three of the ''Infanterie'' riflemen (54/624, 54/626 and 54/628) contained a [[Percussion cap|cap]]-firing device that—when tripped—would, in theory, send a puff of smoke out the barrel of their (oversize) rifles. Many of the tin plate artillery pieces not only fired caps but projectiles as well—which, in theory were fired only at enemy soldiers and never at family pets or one's younger siblings!

Enterprising young generals with the financial resources to do so could also provide their forces with [[Military engineering|engineer]] units using two types of man-powered water craft for crossing water obstacles, and with either a [[pontoon bridge]] or a conventional girder bridge so that horses and motor vehicles could cross as well.

==Post-World War II production==
Limited production of composition figures resumed several years after the end of World War II in 1945 subject to the strict terms of "de-Nazification." Post-war production included the politically inoffensive Swiss figures with their black German-style helmets and black ankle boots, and a new line of American army figures wearing the dark olive uniform and [[M1 helmet|"steel pot" style helmet]] of the WWII-era US Army.

Figures representing the post-war ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' and Austrian armies went into production after 
West Germany and Austria were again allowed to form military forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.toy-soldier-gallery.com/Index.cgi?action=source&amp;source=details&amp;id=80 Hausser Elastolin Flyer Bundeswehr 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Hausser continued to use the brand name ''Elastolin'' when it began production of figures in a hard [[polystyrene]] plastic in 1955 (production of figures in the older sawdust-based composition material continued). In the years that followed the company produced Roman soldiers, Huns, Vikings, Normans, ''Landsknechts'' and 17th-century Turks. Hausser-Elastolin also manufactured personality figures of Prince Valiant and at least one or two other characters from the popular comic strip and feature film.

Some of the old figure lines -- [[Medieval]] figures, "Trappers" (cowboys), American Indians and de-Nazified figures of World War-II era German soldiers—were also manufactured in plastic. Hausser had exclusive rights to produce figures for the works of [[Karl May]], a German author whose tales of the American "Wild West" captured the imaginations of several generations of German boys, and so there are plastic figures representing several of May's best-known characters.

Along with these figures came an impressive new line of catapults, siege towers, a battering ram, camp fences, and early artillery pieces.

Collectors recognize several distinct production series (or types) of these plastic figures. The early lines were sold fully painted as with the older composition figures, a later line was sold unpainted. Plastic figures cannot be correctly identified or appraised in terms of value without reference to the color of the plastic. Beyond that, the rarity (and value) of some figures is also determined by the color of their clothing; some colors are rarer than others.

The 1980 catalog includes Romans, Vikings, Huns, Normans/[[Medieval]] figures (including Prince Valiant and Sir Gawain), ''Landsknechts'', Turks, American Indians, cowboys, US cavalry, [[Karl May]] characters, Arabs, US War of Independence figures (US regulars and militia, English and German), Prussian soldiers, Union and Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War, contemporary Swiss and Austrian soldiers, de-Nazified World War-II era German soldiers, and two figures representing the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].

The cowboys included two masked outlaws and several men wearing buckskin rather than cloth. The line also included the unfortunate prisoner tied to a tree.

In addition to all the fighting men where were also some civilians—a blacksmith and several helpers with a forge and well from the Middle Ages, and a few Caucasian women and children from the American "Wild West" as the counterparts for the American Indian women and children. Each of the Revolutionary War forces could call on the services of a woman holding a cup in one hand a larger container in the other—presumably both held water. 
  
Historical personality figurers in 1980 included [[Götz von Berlichingen]], [[Georg von Frundsberg]] and [[Friedrich der Große]]. One of the several Revolutionary War figures was certainly intended to be George Washington, but the catalog did not identify him as such.

Wheeled vehicles included a four-horse Roman chariot, a ''Kampfwagen'' (battle wagen) of the European late-Middle Ages, an American stage coach drawn by two horses, and an American covered wagen (also drawn by two horses)

==Demise== 
Hausser stopped manufacturing figures from composite materials in 1969. Production of plastic figures continued through 1982. The company filed for bankruptcy in June 1983 and ceased production by the end of the year.

Many of the Hausser [[Molding (process)|mould]]s were purchased by the Preiser company and are currently being reproduced in plastic.

The '''Entertainments National Service Association''' ('''ENSA''') was an organisation set up in 1939 by [[Basil Dean]] and [[Leslie Henson]] to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during [[World War II]]. ENSA operated as part of the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]]. It was superseded by [[Combined Services Entertainment]] (CSE) which now operates as part of the [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation]] (SSVC).

The first big wartime variety concert organised by ENSA was broadcast by the [[BBC]] to the Empire and local networks from RAF Hendon in north London on 17 October 1939. [[Adelaide Hall]], [[The Western Brothers]] and [[Mantovani]] were amongst those entertainers appearing on the bill.

During 1945, actors [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Ralph Richardson|Sir Ralph Richardson]] were created honorary army lieutenants in ENSA. They performed Shakespeare's plays for the troops in a six-week tour of Europe.

==In popular culture==
Despite many extremely talented entertainers and movie stars working for ENSA, the organisation was necessarily spread thin over the vast area it had to cover. Thus many entertainments were substandard, and the popular translation of the acronym ENSA was ''"Every Night Something Awful"''.

ENSA plays a modest role in the 1944 motion picture [[Love Story (1944 film)|Love Story]] in which [[Margaret Lockwood]] stars as a concert pianist who makes an ENSA tour to North Africa and the Mediterranean region.

The 1959 film ''[[Desert Mice]]'' follows the fictional escapades of an ENSA troop starring Sid James assigned to the Africa core.

''Chaos Supersedes ENSA'', a mini-series (1980), was written and directed by [[Patrick Garland]] for [[Thames Television]].

The television sitcom ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' concerned the misadventures of a group of soldiers providing entertainment for an army barracks in [[India]].  These were known as the ''[[Concert Party (entertainment)|Concert Party]]'' and were not ENSA members at all as they were all members of the Royal Artillery and were members of the Army (in fact in the early episodes, they were all in danger of being sent to the front by the Sergeant Major ([[Windsor Davies]].)

ENSA also featured in the television sitcom ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', in the episode "How I Won the War".

The only known ENSA theatre to have survived in its original condition is the Garrison Theatre at [[Hurst Castle]] in the [[New Forest#New Forest National Park|New Forest National Park]]. Created by servicemen in 1939, the proscenium arch still bears the badge and grenades of the [[Royal Artillery]], and the curtains still hang from an original galvanised gas pipe. Shows are presented from time to time by the Friends of Hurst Castle.

In the ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' episode entitled "Camping In", Mr. Grainger told a story of being a member of ENSA which Mr. Humphries said stood for "Every Night Something awful 'Appens".

In the popular [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode "[[Museum Piece]]", ENSA is revealed to be using the rifles [[Captain Mainwaring]] so desperately seeks.

In the [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Up Pompeii]]'' episode "[[Lysistrata the Peace Treaty]]", The main character Lurcio ([[Frankie Howerd]]) is conscripted into the army. He is told by Captain Bumptius that he will be assigned to "ENSA". Lurcio responds that it is not that bad and starts going over show ideas. Captain Bumptius then tells him it stands for the "East Naples Suicide Army"!

The film was written by Raimi and [[Scott Spiegel]], produced by [[Robert Tapert]], and stars [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]].

Filming took place in Michigan and North Carolina in 1986, and the film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987. It was a minor box office success, achieving just under $6 million. It garnered positive reviews in which critics praised Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance. Like the original, ''Evil Dead II'' has accumulated a [[Cult film|cult following]]. The film was followed by a third installment, ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', in 1992 and a television series, ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'', in 2015.

==Plot==
The movie opens with a brief (and altered/reimagined/truncated) recap of the first movie. [[Ash Williams]] and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of [[archaeologist]] Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Book of the Dead, ''[[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'', which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a "[[deadite]]". Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel and bury her near the cabin.

At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. Ash briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the force is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash attempts to flee the area, but finds that the bridge leading to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases Ash back to the cabin where Linda's revived head attacks him, biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless deadite Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Then Ash's possessed right hand tries to kill him, and Ash is forced to sever his hand with his chainsaw. Ash then attempts to shoot the severed hand hiding in the wall of the cabin. The hand mocks him and ultimately gets away. 

Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of locals Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane by the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life with objects in the room laughing hysterically at him.

The four new arrivals meet Ash at the cabin and listen to a recording of Knowby detailing how his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, forcing him to kill her. They find Mrs. Knowby, now a deadite, in the cabin's root cellar, and it attacks and possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe tries to escape but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. Annie translates two of the pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, holding them at gunpoint to force them to go look for Bobby Joe. Ash is possessed once again and turns on his remaining companions, incapacitating Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) and drags him to the cellar door, where he is killed by Henrietta in a gory bloodbath. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self when he sees his girlfriend Linda's necklace.

Ash, with Annie's help, modifies the chainsaw and attaches it to his stump, where his right hand had been. Ash eventually finds the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' and kills Henrietta, who has turned into a long-necked monster. After Ash kills Henrietta, the woods begin to unleash destruction on the house. Annie reveals that she has only read the first half of the incantation.  The spirit of the woods attacks the house as Annie starts to read the second half. As she reads it, she is interrupted as she turns around, revealing that Ash's possessed hand has stabbed her in the back with the Kandarrian dagger.  She falls to the floor as Ash is attacked by the spirit of the woods.  When all hope is lost, Annie completes the incantation.  The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex/portal which not only draws in the demon, but nearby trees, Ash's [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and Ash himself. Annie dies just as she finishes the incantation.

Ash and his Oldsmobile land in the year 1300 AD. He is then confronted by a group of knights who initially mistake him for a deadite, but they are quickly distracted when a real one shows up. Ash blasts the harpy-like deadite with his shotgun and is hailed as a hero who has come to save the realm, at which point he breaks down and screams in anguish.

==Cast==
* [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]], a man who travels to the cabin in the woods to spend the weekend with his girlfriend Linda. As the story follows, he must defeat the evil powers around him that keep growing. After enough attacks, he decides to take the evil head-on equipped with a shotgun and a chainsaw and sets out to face the enemy.
* Sarah Berry as Annie Knowby, Professor Knowby's daughter who travels to the cabin looking forward to share her discoveries of the ''Book of the Dead'' with her father. She thinks Ash murdered her parents at first, but when the Kandarian Demon unleashes against them, she realizes the truth and finds out her only way to survive is to help Ash defeat the spirit.
* [[Dan Hicks (actor)|Dan Hicks]] as Jake, a white-trash guy who freaks out before the demon. When things turn bad, he thinks they have to escape before they all get killed. He is accidentally stabbed in the chest by Annie when trying to escape a possessed Ash. Badly wounded but still alive, Annie tries dragging him to safety in the living room near the trapdoor to the fruit cellar, where he is attacked and eaten alive by Henrietta.
* [[Kassie DePaiva|Kassie Wesley]] as Bobby Joe, Jake's foul-mouthed, self-centered girlfriend. She tries to escape the cabin, only to be killed by the woods themselves (in a similar fashion to how Cheryl was raped in [[The Evil Dead|the first film]]).
* [[Ted Raimi]] as Possessed Henrietta, Annie's possessed mother who uses her memories to lure her in order to kill her and everybody else, but is killed when Ash stabs her through the chest with his chainsaw.
* Denise Bixler as Linda, Ash's girlfriend. She gets possessed, then tries to kill Ash. In a desperate effort, he beheads her with a shovel before burying her. Later on, her corpse rises from the grave and resumes her intentions to kill Ash with both her severed head and her body acting separately. He finally gets rid of her by chopping her up with a chainsaw. Bixler replaces [[Betsy Baker]], who portrayed Linda in the first film.
* Richard Domeier as Professor Ed Getley, Professor Knowby's associate and Annie's boyfriend. After being attacked by the possessed Henrietta, he gets possessed. He meets his doom when Ash dismembers him with an axe.
* John Peaks as Professor Knowby, the archaeologist who found the ''Book of the Dead''. When he took it to his cabin to translate it, he accidentally unleashed the Kandarian Demon. His fate remains unknown, since he only appears as a floating head from another plane of existence.
* Lou Hancock as Henrietta Knowby, Professor Knowby's wife. She gets possessed when her husband accidentally unleashes the demon of the ''Book of the Dead''. According to the Professor's recordings he was forced to kill Henrietta when she became demonically possessed and attacked him. He then buried her body in the fruit cellar where she reanimates and remains a recurring villain (portrayed by Ted Raimi) through the second half of the film.
* William Preston Robertson provides the voice of the Evil Dead, the film's main antagonist. It is a sinister, otherworldly spiritual presence summoned by Professor Knowby's translations of the ''Necronomicon'', and proceeds to isolate and kill the cabin's inhabitants.

==Production==
===Development===
The concept of a [[sequel]] to ''The Evil Dead'' was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Raimi wanted to toss his hero, Ash, through a time portal, back into the [[Middle Ages]]. That notion eventually led to the third installment, ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.

After the release of ''The Evil Dead'', Raimi moved on to ''[[Crimewave]]'', a cross between a [[crime film]] and a [[Comedy film|comedy]] produced by Raimi and [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]]. [[Irvin Shapiro]], a publicist who was primarily responsible for the mainstream release of ''The Evil Dead'', suggested that they next work on an ''Evil Dead'' sequel. Raimi scoffed at the idea, expecting ''Crimewave'' to be a hit, but Shapiro put out ads announcing the sequel regardless.

After ''Crimewave'' was released to little audience or critical reaction, Raimi and Tapert, knowing that another flop would further stall their already lagging careers, took Shapiro up on his offer. Around the same time, they met Italian film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the owner of production and distribution company [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|DEG]]. He had asked Raimi if he would direct a theatrical adaptation of the [[Stephen King]] (written under his [[Richard Bachman]] pseudonym) novel ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]''. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis continued to be interested in the young filmmaker.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evil Dead Companion|last=Warren|first=Bill|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2001|isbn=9780312275013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBrJ3M71rUIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}

The ''Thinner'' adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful [[horror fiction]]. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', based on his short story "[[Trucks (short story)|Trucks]]." He had dinner with a crew member who had been interviewed about the ''Evil Dead'' sequel, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|104}}

Though initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed after being presented with the extremely high Italian revenue for the first film. Although Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, they were allotted only $3.6 million. As such, the planned medieval storyline had to be scrapped.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|106}}

===Script===
Though they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of ''Crimewave''. Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the [[Super 8 mm film]]s they had produced during their childhood in [[Michigan]]. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that ''Evil Dead II'' should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|109–110}}

Spiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]], where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors [[Frances McDormand]], [[Kathy Bates]], and [[Holly Hunter]] (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, ''Crimewave'' and [[Josh Becker]]'s ''[[Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except]]'', the script took a long time to finish.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|109}}

Among the film's many inspirations include [[The Three Stooges]] and other [[slapstick comedy]] films; Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager, entitled ''[[Attack of the Helping Hand]]'', which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising [[Hamburger Helper]]. The "laughing room" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a [[Popeye]]-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|111}}

While Raimi and Campbell have stated that ''Evil Dead 2'' was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first movie and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of ''The Evil Dead'' yet remains intact in ''Evil Dead 2''. The corpses of Ash’s friends from the first movie are absent, and they are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.

===Filming===
With the script completed, and a production company secured, [[principal photography]] began. The production commenced in [[Wadesboro, North Carolina]], not far from De Laurentiis' offices in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. [[Steven Spielberg]] had previously filmed ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for ''Evil Dead II''. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|113}}

The film's production was not nearly as chaotic or strange as the original film's production, largely because of Raimi, Tapert and Campbell's additional film making experience. However, there are nevertheless numerous stories about the strange happenings on the set. For instance, the rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed "Señor Cojones" by the crew ("[[Spanish profanity#Cojones|cojones]]" is [[Spanish language|Spanish slang]] for "[[testicles]]").

Even so, there were hardships, mostly involving [[Ted Raimi]]'s costume. Ted, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a [[fake Shemp]], but in ''Evil Dead II'' he gets the larger role of the historian's demonically-possessed wife, Henrietta. Raimi was forced to wear a full-body, [[latex]] costume, crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a "cellar", or on one day, both. Raimi became extremely overheated, to the point that his costume was literally filled with liters of sweat; special effects artist [[Gregory Nicotero]] describes pouring the fluid into several [[Dixie Cup|Dixie cups]] so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;{{rp|125}}

The crew sneaked various [[in-joke]]s into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of [[Freddy Krueger]] (the primary antagonist of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of [[slasher film]]s) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by [[Heather Langenkamp]]), dozes off watching the original ''Evil Dead'' on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' poster seen in the original ''Evil Dead'' film, which was itself a reference to a torn ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' poster in ''The Hills Have Eyes''.

At the film's [[wrap party]], the crew held a talent contest, where Raimi and Campbell sang [[The Byrds]]' "[[Eight Miles High]]", with Nicotero on [[guitar]].&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in Evil Dead II audio commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Evil Dead II'' opened on March 13, 1987 to a weekend gross of $807,260. At this time, it was only in 310 theatres, resulting in its smaller gross. However, after spending a little over a month in theatres, the film ultimately grossed $5,923,044 domestically.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=evildead2.htm|title=Evil Dead 2 (1987)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 98% of 53 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 8/10. The site's consensus reads: "''Evil Dead 2''{{'}}s increased special effects and slapstick-gore makes it as good – if not better – than the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn/ |title= ''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'' Movie Reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the similar website [[Metacritic]], it holds a score of 69 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/evildead2deadbydawn |title= ''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'' Film Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine praised the film, saying "the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book" and confirms that "Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=5047|title=Evil Dead II|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE2D6103EF930A25750C0A961948260 |work=The New York Times |title=''Evil Dead 2'' Movie Review |date=March 13, 1987 |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars,&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, 2001, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; but later increased the rating to three stars.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, 2009, 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle." He praised the film's sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and "grubby, low-budget intensity." Ebert states that "if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at ''Evil Dead 2''."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100304/1023|title=Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=rogerebert.com|date=April 10, 1987|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrington of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrapped up his review stating that "the acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?"&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Harrington|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/evildead2deadbydawnnrharrington_a0aa40.htm|title=Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn|work=Washington Post|publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=April 30, 1987|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Pat Graham of ''Chicago Reader'' disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that "The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evil Dead II|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil-dead-2/reviews/?sort=rotten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the film #19 on their list of "The Top 50 Cult Films".&lt;ref name= "EWCult"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The Top 50 Cult Films | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = May 23, 2003 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sight and Sound]]'' ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, ''Empire'' magazine included ''Evil Dead II'' on their list of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'', ranked #49.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = | last = | title =The 500 greatest movies of all time | url =http://www.empireonline.com/500/88.asp | publisher =''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' | accessdate =September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.C. Maçek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, "Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, ''Evil Dead II'' is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Books of the Dead: The Followers and Clones of 'The Evil Dead'|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III|date=2013-04-26|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/170551-books-of-the-dead-the-followers-and-clones-of-the-evil-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Expressive Intelligence Studio''' is a research group at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], established to conduct research in the field of [[game design]] technology.&lt;ref name="Santa Cruz Sentinel"&gt;[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_14486926?IADID Popular gaming program making UC Santa Cruz one of the elite]&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is currently being run by [[Michael Mateas]], [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]], [[Arnav Jhala]], and [[Jim Whitehead (professor)|Jim Whitehead]], who work closely with the students in their research.&lt;ref name="EIS Page"&gt;[http://eis.ucsc.edu/people People | Expressive Intelligence Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When Michael Mateas formed the group back in 2006, his goal was to "stretch the students into being creative." He did not want the game design program at UCSC to be "just about photo-realistic graphics." Instead he wanted to form an ambitious group of students that grabbed the attention of the gaming industry.&lt;ref name="Santa Cruz Sentinel"/&gt; According to Noah Wardrip-Fruin, a major benefit for establishing the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UCSC is its proximity to [[Silicon Valley]], where many game companies are located.&lt;ref name="Santa Cruz Sentinel"/&gt; In 2011, UCSC was listed 7th on [[Princeton Review]]'s list of top graduate game design programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princetonreview.com/game-design-press-release.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Most of the research done by the Expressive Intelligence Studio is done through major research projects, and focuses primarily on [[video game AI]].&lt;ref name="EIS Main Page"&gt;[http://eis.ucsc.edu/ Expressive Intelligence Studio]&lt;/ref&gt; PhD students in the program work closely with the advisors on these projects, which have a wide range of topics. Some of these topics include automated support for game generation, automatic generation of autonomous character conversations, story management, and authoring tools for [[interactive storytelling]].&lt;ref name = "GamePro"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110607063926/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/214810/starcraft-bot-plays-like-pro/&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research in the field of game design is only being done in a small number of other institutions, such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Southern California]], and [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. According to Mateas, however, the program at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] Expressive Intelligence Studio strikes a balance between technology and design.&lt;ref name="Santa Cruz Sentinel"/&gt;

The studio has released several playable games based on research ideas, including [[Prom Week]], the only university-produced finalist in the 2012 [[Independent Games Festival]].&lt;ref name="Chronicle of Higher Education"&gt;http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-video-game-tests-new-artificial-intelligence-engine-at-the-prom/35021&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example EISbot==
The EISbot software (short for Expressive Intelligence Studio Bot) is an example for a human-level [[artificial intelligence]] which can play [[StarCraft (video game)|Starcraft]]. It was developed in 2010 for the [[Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment]] (AIIDE). The AIIDE Starcraft AI Competition is about a game playing agent, who has to win against a human player. EISbot was realized as an [[agent architecture]], which contains submodules for reactive planning, machine learning and case-based reasoning. The reactive planner is the core of EISbot and was realized with [[A Behavior Language]] (ABL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title = Evaluating the Improvements of StarCraft Gameplay in the ABL Agent EISBot by Implementing Dynamic Specificities through an External Component |author = Okun, Jared |conference = MATEC Web of Conferences, EDP Sciences |volume = 68 |pages = 18001 |year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an [[action language]] similar to [[STRIPS]]. The behaviors are planned with so called managers who are responsible for subgoals like production, income, tactics and scouting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type = PhD |title = Integrating learning in a multi-scale agent | author = Weber, Ben |year = 2012 |publisher = UC Santa Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Fukuoka Municipal Zoo and Botanical Garden'''|福岡市動植物園|Fukuoka-shi Dōshokubutsuen}}, also known as the '''Fukuoka City Zoological Garden''', is a [[zoo]] and [[botanical garden]] established in 1953 and located within Minami-koen (''En'': "South park") at 1-1, Minami-Koen, [[Chūō-ku, Fukuoka|Chūō-ku]], [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka]], [[Japan]].

The garden contains about 1,300 types of outdoor garden plants, mostly common. Its greenhouse contains over 1,200 plant species including [[orchid]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[cactus|cacti]].&lt;ref name="fukuoka-now"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:PC130044.JPG|thumb|right|270px|A [[Malayan sun bear]] from Fukuoka Zoo]]
The gardens were originally established near the city's East park in 1933 as part of the celebration of the coronation of Emperor [[Hirohito]]. This small {{Convert|5096|tsubo|ha|sing=on}} zoo and botanical garden included about 500 animals and 100 species of plants. The zoo was closed to the public on 20 May 1944 due to the deteriorating state of [[World War II]] for the country. Large animals were subsequently euthanized. Pillars from the old zoo gate are still standing near one of the elementary schools in the city.&lt;ref name="zoo_pre-history"/&gt;

In 1949 the city approved the establishment of a zoo in the city's South park. The Fukuoka City Zoological Society was established in 1952, and {{yen}}28 million was raised for the new zoo.&lt;ref name="zoo_pre-history"/&gt;

The zoo opened in its current location on 22 August 1953, with 143 animals representing 69 species. It included a play area with a miniature train and a Ferris wheel.&lt;ref name="zoo_phase_1"/&gt; When it opened, the zoo was home to one elephant, who was still living at the zoo in 2011.&lt;ref name="elephantse"/&gt;

In 1954 the zoo was expanded to the North by about {{Convert|6500|tsubo|sing=on}}, and the animal collection expanded to include 353 individuals representing 110 species. In 1955 the zoo was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Tourism Division, Fukuoka. An additional {{Convert|6|ha}} was added to the zoo in 1956, and the animal collection again expanded to include 400 individuals of 120 species.&lt;ref name="zoo_phase_1"/&gt;

By 2003 (the fiftieth anniversary of opening in its current location), the zoo had hosted more than 40 million visitors, and was home to 706 animals representing 168 species, including 57 species of mammals, 88 species of birds, and 23 species of reptiles.&lt;ref name="zoo_phase_5-2"/&gt;

'''Generic characters''' are interchangeable characters, appearing mostly in [[Animated series|animated shows]] or [[comic strips]]. They often reappear at different times with different jobs, or are seen in the background. Animation or comic strip artists, when in need of a character who furthers the story without becoming part of it, often use an existing character from their repertoire instead of inventing a new one. Generics can be considered to be similar to [[gag characters]], but might stay longer.

'''''Hot Coffee''''' is a normally inaccessible [[mini-game]] in the 2004 [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', developed by [[Rockstar North]]. Public awareness of the existence of the mini-game arrived with the release of the ''Hot Coffee'' [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], created for the [[Microsoft Windows]] port of ''GTA: San Andreas'' in 2005. This mod enables access to the mini-game.

The mini-game portrays animated [[sexual intercourse]] between the main character, [[Carl "CJ" Johnson]], and his chosen in-game [[girlfriend]]. The name of the mod is derived from the girlfriend's offer for the main character to come into her home for "coffee", a euphemism for sex.

Although the "Hot Coffee" mini-game was completely disabled and its existence was only highlighted after the mod's release for the PC version on June 9, 2005,&lt;ref name=ModRelease&gt;{{cite web | url = http://patrickw.gtagames.nl/mods.html | title = Hot Coffee mod developer's mod listing | work = PatrickW's modding website | accessdate = July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the assets for the mini-game were also discovered in both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions of the game, and people found ways to enable the mini-game via console video game hacking tools. By the middle of July 2005, the mini-game's discovery attracted considerable [[Video game controversy|controversy]] from lawmakers and politicians, prompting the game to be re-assessed with an "[[List of AO-rated video games|Adults Only (AO)]]" [[Video game ratings system|rating]] by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), and refused classification in Australia, resulting in its removal from sale.

An updated version of ''San Andreas'' has since been released with the mini-game removed completely, allowing the game to regain its original rating. A [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the original version of the game, Cold Coffee, was designed to counter edit the script and disable the mini-game and crash the game if one attempts to access it.&lt;ref name=nomoarcoffee&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nomorehotcoffee.com/ | title = No More Hot Coffee | work = [[Rockstar Games]] | accessdate =  15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minigame overview and ''Hot Coffee'' mod ==
{{Tone|date=November 2008}}
Throughout the game, [[Carl "CJ" Johnson]], the game's protagonist, may date up to six [[girlfriend]]s, carrying out various "date missions" in order to improve his relationship with a particular woman. Once CJ has become particularly close to a girlfriend, or if he has collected all oysters in the game, his girlfriend may end a successful date by inviting him into her house for "coffee," from which CJ may choose to accept or decline. Improving relationships with girlfriends through successful dates and other related activities will eventually reward CJ with new items, such as vehicles and special wardrobes, along with pre-existing gameplay benefits (e.g. dating a nurse grants CJ with free visits to the hospital without losing his weapons after dying).

In the unmodified version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', players see an exterior view of the girlfriend's house while muffled voices of CJ and his girlfriend engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] are heard. However, the ''Hot Coffee'' mod replaces this with a minigame which allows the player to actually enter the girlfriend's bedroom and control Carl's actions during sex, with the same controls as dancing.

[[Rockstar Games]], the publisher of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, initially denied allegations that the mini-game was "hidden" in the video game, stating that the ''Hot Coffee'' modification (which they claim violated the game's [[software license|End User License Agreement]]) is the result of "[[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]" making "significant technical modifications to and [[reverse engineering]]" the game's code.&lt;ref name=baertlein&gt;{{cite web | url = https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20050714/us_nm/media_grandtheftauto_dc_2 | title = 'Grand Theft' maker blames hackers for sex scenes | work = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 13 July 2005 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201757/http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story | archive-date = 2005-03-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim was undermined when a user known as '''gothi''' from the website '''PS2 Save Tools''' released the "GTA:SA Censor Remover" tool for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions in June 2005, which allowed the minigame to be accessed on consoles. These new methods of accessing "Hot Coffee" demonstrated that the controversial content was, indeed, built into the console versions as well.

The PC mod itself is only an edited copy of the main game script file ("main.scm") with a single [[bit]] changed. The mod was also made possible on the console versions by changing the bit inside a user's saved game file or by using a third-party modding device. Take-Two has stated that the mod constitutes a violation of the End User License Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051017024339/http://ir.take2games.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=169278 Take-Two Games - Investor Relations General Information]&lt;/ref&gt; even though modification of the main.scm file is common within the mod community.

However, the oral sex animations are clearly visible in the background during one scene of the mission "Cleaning the Hood", even in the re-released game.&lt;ref name="Norway"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/it/article432538.ece | title = Nye sex-avsløringer i drapsspill |trans-title=New sex revelations in murder game | work = [[Nettavisen]] | date = 5 August 2005 | language = Norwegian | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160416042146/http://pub.nettavisen.no/432538.html | archivedate = 16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why the minigame was not simply removed when the decision was made to cut it from the game; its assets were already in use elsewhere.&lt;ref name="romblog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.romsteady.net/blog/2005/07/my-take-on-hot-coffee.html | title = My Take On "Hot Coffee" | work = Rom's Rants | accessdate =  14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{wikinewspar2|Video game's secret sex scenes spark outrage|Grand Theft Auto under fire}}
The revelation of the mini-game sparked a fair amount of controversy around ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'', with some politicians firing harsh words at both the game's developer and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), the organization which establishes content ratings for video games in North America. It also rekindled the debate over the influence of video games in general with new protests against several other games such as ''[[Killer7]]'', ''[[The Sims 2]]'', and ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]''.

[[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] was one of the first to criticize the game for its hidden content, believing violent media is one of the main causes of violent crime in America. Thompson lashed out against [[Rockstar Games]] on several occasions for previous games they have developed.

[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] suggested that new regulations be put on video games sales.&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/14/news_6129040.html | title = Clinton calls for federal game regulation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721031345/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/14/news_6129040.html |archivedate=21 July 2005 | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate =  14 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESRB]] conducted an investigation that ultimately changed the game's rating from Mature to Adults Only 18+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowles |first=Scott |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/games/2005-07-20-gta-sex_x.htm |title='Grand Theft Auto' gets pulled over - USA Today July 20, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-07-21 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Congress passed a resolution to have the [[Federal Trade Commission]] investigate whether Rockstar intentionally undermined the ESRB by having the content in the game.&lt;ref name="feldman2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/news_6129836.html | title = Take-Two sued, confirms FTC investigation | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate =  27 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, a [[class action lawsuit]] was filed by Florence Cohen, an 85-year-old grandmother who purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson (according to the old rating of "M", the game is typically considered inappropriate for this age). Cohen's lawsuit claimed that Rockstar Games and [[Take-Two Interactive]], the publisher of the game, are guilty of [[deception]], [[false advertising]], [[fraud]] and [[abuse]].  The accusation of deception is based on the change from M-rated to AO, meaning according to the lawsuit that the original rating was a deceptive practice.&lt;ref name="berardini"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/8839/Grandma-Sues-Rockstar-Over-San-Andreas/ | title = Grandma Sues Rockstar Over San Andreas | work = [[TeamXbox]] | accessdate = 27 July 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050730024832/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/8839/Grandma-Sues-Rockstar-Over-San-Andreas/ | archivedate = 30 July 2005 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protest group known as the Peaceholics organized a protest on August 4, 2005 at Rockstar's headquarters. The group demonstrated against ''San Andreas'' as well as the game ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'', the latter due to fears that the content could inspire children to become bullies themselves.&lt;ref name="ransom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000070053157/ | title = March against Bully | work = [[Joystiq]] | accessdate = 4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crecente"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/gaming/rockstar/group-releases-rockstar-demands-115751.php | title = Group Releases Rockstar Demands | work = [[Joystiq]] | accessdate = 4 August 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125164311/http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/rockstar/group-releases-rockstar-demands-115751.php | archivedate = 25 November 2005 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==

=== Product re-rating ===
On July 8, 2005, the [[ESRB]] announced that it was aware of and opening an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 'Hot Coffee.' The  investigation examined "whether the mod unlocks preexisting code...or is actually a purely third-party creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/esrb-to-investigate-san-andreas-sex-content/2100-1043_3-5780374.html |title=ESRB to investigate San Andreas sex content |publisher=CNET Networks |work=CNET |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2005, the [[ESRB]] announced that it was changing the rating of ''GTA:SA'' from ''Mature'' (M) to ''Adults Only'' (AO), making this the first and only ''Grand Theft Auto'' game to receive an AO Rating.&lt;ref name="RerateToAORating"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6129500.html | title = San Andreas rated AO, Take-Two suspends production | work = [[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] | accessdate = July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockstar stated that it would discontinue manufacturing the current version of the game, and produce a new version that would not include the content that is unlocked by the Hot Coffee mod. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Rockstar released this "clean" version with the "Hot Coffee" scenes removed (''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' 1.01), allowing the rating of the game to be reverted to its original ''Mature'' rating.&lt;ref name="RevertToMRating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |title=FTC Hot Coffee ruling scalds, but doesn't burn Take-Two |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=July 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708231006/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |archivedate=July 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2005, as a result of the newly discovered scenes, the Australian [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) revoked the game's "MA15+" classification (the highest rating then available for computer games in Australia) and changed the game's rating to ''Refused Classification'' (RC), which officially banned the original version from being sold in the country. The patched version was given an "MA15+" classification on September 12, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oflc.gov.au/special.html?n=46&amp;p=156&amp;sTitle=San+Andreas&amp;sMediaFilm=1&amp;sMediaPublications=1&amp;sMediaGames=1&amp;sDateFromM=1&amp;sDateFromY=1970&amp;sDateToM=7&amp;sDateToY=2006&amp;record=207350 The Classification Board and Classification Review Board&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2005, Rockstar Games officially released a patch for ''San Andreas''.&lt;ref name="nomorehotcoffee"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nomorehotcoffee.com/ | title = No More Hot Coffee | work = [[Rockstar Games]] patch website | accessdate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patch fixed many performance issues and bugs. However, the patch also disabled the controversial "Hot Coffee" scenes, even if the "Hot Coffee" mod was re-installed.

There was little reaction in [[Europe]]. The game was already rated "18+" by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] prior to the release of the mod. Furthermore, PEGI ratings are enforced by law in many European nations, making it a criminal offense to sell 18+ games to minors. In the United Kingdom, the [[BBFC]] similarly gave the game an "18" rating (as of 2012, the BBFC no longer classifies video games, and PEGI was adopted instead).

=== Product withdrawal and recall ===
{{Wikinews|Stores drop game "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" after given 'Adults Only' rating}}
The day after the rating change, several [[North America]]n chain stores, and [[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association|IEMA]] retailers, which accounted for every major retailer in the [[United States]] and approximately 85% of the game's market in the country, removed the PC and console versions of the game from their store shelves, re-stickered the box with the new rating, or returning it to Take-Two Interactive. These included major chains such as [[GameStop]], [[Sears Holdings Corporation|Sears]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Zellers]], [[Hollywood Video]], [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Best Buy]], and [[Electronics Boutique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/20/technology/personaltech/gta/|title=Wal-Mart and Target Pull ''Grand Theft Auto''|author=Chris Morris|publisher=[[CNN Money]]|date=20 July 2005|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockstar gave some retailers ESRB "Adults Only" rating stickers to put on their copies of ''GTA:SA'', should they decide to keep selling the original product.

[[eBay]] removed copies of ''GTA:SA'' that had been reported by the eBay community. eBay claimed that ''GTA:SA'' violated the terms of the eBay seller policy and could not be sold unless it was located in the ''Everything Else &gt; Mature Audiences'' section. This section requires a credit card to validate the age of the eBay user. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

On August 24, 2005, Rockstar announced a mandatory [[Product recall|recall]] for all games still owned by the general public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Consumers who had already purchased the game were allowed to keep it in certain areas, but with the patch installed, although players cannot be forced to return (or destroy) existing copies. Given the higher value of the "uncensored" versions, it is doubtful that many gamers will return their copies voluntarily.  However, those who were over 18 (or 21 depending on region) have [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] these copies of the game to their collection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Version 2.0 of ''GTA:SA'', which omitted the sexual mini-game content, was designed by Rockstar to crash if the game data files were modified. This made it necessary for players to use a previous version if they wished to install multiplayer game [[Mod (computer gaming)|modification]]s such as ''San Andreas Multiplayer'' or ''[[Multi Theft Auto]]'' and other game modifications that include new scripts or vehicles. Certain [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated or illegally distributed]] versions of the original game may also be made available on the Internet or from illegal retail outlets. Downgraders are also available to unpatch and revert the game version and support the Hot Coffee mini-game again.

This limitation later was overcome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = GTA modding |url=http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=San_Andreas_v2.0_Modding |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; by two members of the unofficial ''Grand Theft Auto'' [[Grand Theft Auto modding|modding]] community, who discovered a method of creating modifications which would work with version 2.0. Users of version 2.0 might still need to use previous versions or use a downgrade in order to install a mod not created with the new method.

=== Federal and legal action ===

In December 2005, Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Evan Bayh]] introduced the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]], which called for a federal mandate enforcement of the ESRB ratings system in order to protect children from inappropriate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/12/16/family-entertainment-protection-act-now-filed/|title=Family Entertainment Protection Act Now Filed|author=Jennie Lees|publisher=''[[Engadget]]''|date=16 December 2005|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2006, the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] filed a lawsuit against [[Take-Two Interactive]], the game's publisher, accusing the company of failing to disclose the game's sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/01/6067-2/|title=Take-Two Interactive Sued over Hot Coffee Mod|author=Eric Bangeman|publisher=''[[Ars Technica]]''|date=27 January 2006|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2006, Rockstar, Take-Two and the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] settled. They are required to "clearly and prominently disclose on product packaging and in any promotion or advertisement for electronic games, content relevant to the rating, unless that content had been disclosed sufficiently in prior submissions to the rating authority." Should the companies violate the settlement they are liable for $11,000 in [[civil penalty|civil penalties]].&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first= David |authorlink= |coauthors= | date=2006-06-08 |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/711/711788p1.html |title=Rockstar, FTC Settle Over Hot Coffee |work= |pages= |publisher=IGN | language= |accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil class actions ===
In 2006 attorneys brought several [[class action]]s alleging Take-Two committed consumer [[fraud]]. In December 2007, a settlement of the litigation was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtasettlement.com/|title=GTA Settlement|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224175535/http://www.gtasettlement.com/|archivedate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Ted Frank]] filed an objection to the settlement on the grounds that the settlement sought $1 million for [[attorney's fee|attorneys' fees]], but the total payout to class members was less than $27,000.&lt;ref name=527GP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/05/27/did-lawyers-inflate-fees-hot-coffee-class-action-suit |publisher=[[Gamepolitics.com]] |title=Did Lawyers Inflate Fees in Hot Coffee Class Action Suit? |date=2008-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906160603/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2008/05/27/did-lawyers-inflate-fees-hot-coffee-class-action-suit |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Over&gt;{{cite web

|date=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court hearing was already scheduled on June 25, 2008.  Frank previously told GamePolitics that the lawsuits were meritless and extortionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the settlement, Take-Two will pay a $873,000 [[Cy-près doctrine|cy-près]] award to the National [[Parent-Teacher Association]] and the ESRB.&lt;ref name=527GP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Over/&gt;

As of June 25, 2008, fewer than 2,700 claimants responded to the settlement, for which the plaintiff's attorneys expressed disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/lawyers-shocked-at-lack-of-hot-coffee-claimants |title=Lawyers shocked at lack of Hot Coffee claimants |accessdate=2008-06-26 |author=Matt Martin |date=2008-06-25 |publisher=[[gamesindustry.biz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank expressed that this was further proof that the case had no merit.

As of September 1, 2009, Take Two agreed to settle a securities class action suit related to the controversy over the game and over backdating allegations for just over $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS220177+01-Sep-2009+BW20090901 |title=Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

'''''Jurassic Park''''' is a 1993 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Gerald R. Molen]]. The first installment in the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' franchise, it is based on the [[Jurassic Park (novel)|1990 novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]] and a screenplay written by Crichton and [[David Koepp]]. The film is set on the fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]], located off [[Central America]]'s Pacific Coast near [[Costa Rica]], where billionaire philanthropist John Hammond and a small team of genetic scientists have created a [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] of [[De-extinction|de-extinct]] [[dinosaur]]s. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and security precautions, a small group of visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, struggle to survive and escape the perilous island.

Before Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With the backing of [[Universal Studios]], Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed ''[[Schindler's List]]''.

The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking [[computer-generated imagery]] by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and with life-sized [[animatronic]] dinosaurs built by [[Stan Winston]]'s team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], a company specializing in digital [[surround sound]] formats. Following an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with 100 companies, ''Jurassic Park'' premiered on June 9, 1993 at the [[Uptown Theater (Washington, D.C.)|Uptown Theater]] in Washington, D.C., and was released on June 11 in the United States. It went on to gross over $914 million worldwide in its original theatrical run, becoming [[1993 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1993]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film ever at the time]], a record held until the release of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). It was well received by critics, who praised its special effects, [[John Williams]]' musical score, and Spielberg's direction. Following its [[3D film|3D]] re-release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, ''Jurassic Park'' became the seventeenth film in history to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales.

The film won more than twenty awards, including three [[Academy Awards]] for its technical achievements in visual effects and sound design. ''Jurassic Park'' is considered a landmark in the development of computer-generated imagery and animatronic visual effects, and was followed by four commercially successful [[sequel]]s, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997), ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' (2001), ''[[Jurassic World]]'' (2015) and ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'' (2018), with a fifth and final sequel, currently titled ''Jurassic World 3'', scheduled for a 2021 release.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
Industrialist John Hammond and his [[Biological engineering|bioengineering]] company, InGen, have created a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on [[Isla Nublar]], a [[Costa Rica]]n island. After one of the dinosaur handlers is killed by a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the certification inspections, Gennaro invites [[mathematician]] and [[chaos theory|chaos theorist]] Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites [[paleontologist]] Dr. Alan Grant and [[paleobotanist]] Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''.

At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting [[Ancient DNA|dinosaur DNA]] from [[mosquito]]es preserved in [[amber]]. DNA from [[frog]]s was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' [[genome]]. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying that it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and visits the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the [[ethics of cloning]] and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of [[genetic engineering]] in general.

The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick ''[[Triceratops]]''. It is cut short as a [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the ''Triceratops''.

Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur [[embryo]]s. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out, and the tour vehicles become stuck because of it. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the park's ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' to escape and attack the group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the ''Tyrannosaurus'' injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his [[Jeep Wrangler]], and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''.

Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm, just before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—[[African bullfrog|West African bullfrogs]] can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.

Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the ''Velociraptors''. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.

After encountering a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' and narrowly escaping the ''Tyrannosaurus'' during a ''[[Gallimimus]]'' stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim (who was injured while scaling one of the fences) and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen, but the children escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the ''Tyrannosaurus'' suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and all of the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.

===Development===
[[File:MichaelCrichton 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Crichton]]'s book attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg even before it was published. The author was also responsible for the film's first scripts.|alt=Michael Crichton wearing a suit.]]
[[Michael Crichton]] originally conceived a [[screenplay]] about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal |year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before publication, [[Steven Spielberg]] learned of the novel in October 1989, while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.&lt;ref name="mcbride"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]] |date=1997|title=Steven Spielberg|publisher= Faber and Faber|pages= 416–9|isbn=0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg determined that what really fascinated him was that ''Jurassic Park'' was "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;{{cite news|title=Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era|work=Jurassic Park|edition= Blu-ray |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Tim Burton]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]] bid for the rights,&lt;ref name="mcbride" /&gt; but [[Universal Studios]] eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;DVD Production Notes&lt;/ref&gt; After completing ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', Spielberg wanted to film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Music Corporation of America]] (then Universal Pictures's parent company) president [[Sid Sheinberg]] gave a green light to the film on the condition that Spielberg made ''Jurassic Park'' first.&lt;ref name="mcbride" /&gt; The director later declared that by choosing a creature-driven thriller, "I was really just trying to make a good sequel to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', on land."&lt;ref&gt;McBride, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

To create the dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring [[Bob Gurr]], who designed a giant mechanical [[King Kong]] for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]'s [[King Kong Encounter]]. Upon considering that the life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not all convincing, Spielberg instead sought the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. Brought in were [[Stan Winston]] to create the [[animatronics|animatronic]] dinosaurs, [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[go motion]] dinosaurs for [[long shot]]s credited as Dinosaur Supervisor, [[Michael Lantieri]] to supervise the on-set effects, and [[Dennis Muren]] of [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] to do the [[digital compositing]]. Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] supervised the designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Epstein |first=Sonia |title=Science on Screen: Interview with Jack Horner, Jurassic World |url=http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/2718/science-on-screen-interview-with-jack-horner-jurassic-world |date=June 14, 2016 |website=Sloan Science &amp; Film |access-date=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. This led to the entry of certain concepts about dinosaurs, such as the theory that dinosaurs [[Origin of birds|evolved into birds]] and had very little in common with lizards. One of the first consequences was the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early [[animatics]],&lt;ref name="Earl doc"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Making of Jurassic Park| author=[[James Earl Jones|Jones, James Earl]] (Host) | medium = VHS | publisher = Universal |year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Horner complained it was implausible.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite news|author=French, Lawrence|work=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=24|number=2|page= 9|title=Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding [[latex]] skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in the kitchen and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attacking the car. But despite go motion's attempts at [[motion blur]]s, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a [[live-action]] feature film. Muren declared to Spielberg that he thought the dinosaurs could be built through [[computer-generated imagery]], and the director asked him to prove it.&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; ILM animators [[Mark A.Z. Dippé|Mark Dippé]] and [[Steve Williams (animator)|Steve Williams]] developed a computer-generated walk cycle for the ''T. rex'' skeleton, and were approved to do more.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the ''T. rex'' chasing a herd of ''Gallimimus'', Spielberg said, "You're out of a job," to which Tippett replied, "Don't you mean extinct?"&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; Spielberg later injected this exchange into the script, as a conversation between Malcolm and Grant.&lt;ref name="gallies"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no go motion was used, Tippett and his animators were still used by the production to supervise dinosaur movement. Tippett acted as a consultant regarding dinosaur anatomy, and his stop motion animators were re-trained as computer animators.&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; The animatics made by Tippett's team were also used along with the [[storyboard]]s as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences.&lt;ref name=pre&gt;{{cite news|title=Return to Jurassic Park: Making Prehistory|work=Jurassic Park|edition=Blu-ray |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILM's artists were sent to private tours to the local animal park so they could study large animals — rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes — up close, and also received [[mime]] classes for understanding movements.&lt;ref name=back/&gt;

Universal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Leaping Lizards | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 7, 1990 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318785,00.html | accessdate=February 17, 2007 | first=Tim | last=Appelo}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''. Crichton noted that because the book was "fairly long" his script only had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and despite the gory descriptions, the violence was toned down.&lt;ref name="Biodrowski"&gt;Biodrowski, Steve. "[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/1993/08/jurassic-park-michael-crichton-on-adapting-his-novel-to-the-screen/ JURASSIC PARK: [[Michael Crichton]] on Adapting his Novel to the Screen]". ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, August 1993 (Vol. 24, No.2), pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malia Scotch Marmo]] began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 39–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Spielberg wanted another writer to rework the script, Universal president [[Casey Silver]] recommended him [[David Koepp]], co-writer of ''[[Death Becomes Her]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Backstory 5: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1990s |author=McGilligan, Patrick |publisher=University of California Press |year=2010 |ISBN=0-520-25105-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koepp started afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.&lt;ref name="koepp"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 55–6.&lt;/ref&gt; While Koepp tried to avoid excessive character detail "because whenever they started talking about their personal lives, you couldn't care less",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A World Apart|author=Biskind, Peter|journal=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; he tried to flesh out the characters and make for a more colorful cast, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Sattler leading to Grant's jealousy.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; Some [[characterization]]s were changed from the novel. Hammond went from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.&lt;ref name="lack of story?"&gt;McBride, p. 421–422.&lt;/ref&gt; He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged eleven and interested in computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and interested in sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant.&lt;ref name="casting"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development.&lt;ref name="mcbride" /&gt;

Two scenes from the book were ultimately excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with ''[[Procompsognathus]]'' attacking a young child as he previously found it too horrific,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Tale Of Two 'Jurassics' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = June 18, 1993 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306930,00.html | accessdate = February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the ''T. rex'' chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels.&lt;ref name="koepp" /&gt; Spielberg suggested the addition of the scene where the ''T. rex'' pursues a jeep, which at first would only have the characters driving away after listening to the dinosaur's footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/david-koepp-13615|title=David Koepp: Writer's block|date=September 8, 1999|work=[[The A.V.

===Casting===
[[William Hurt]] was initially offered the role of Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/90985449/|title=Answers to all that jazz about 'Jurassic'|last=|first=|date=June 19, 1993|work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]]|access-date=June 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harrison Ford]] was also offered the role of Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/indiana-jones-sequel-jurassic-park-harrison-ford-steven-spielberg-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-video/|title=Harrison Ford on an 'Indy' sequel, turning down 'Jurassic Park'|last=Clark|first=Noelene|date=September 16, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Neill was ultimately cast as Grant three or four weeks before filming began. Neill said that "it all happened real quick. I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't heard anything about it, and in a matter of weeks I'm working with Spielberg."&lt;ref name=EW2013/&gt; Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. [[Jim Carrey]] also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey "was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff."&lt;ref name=EW2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/04/jurassic-park-oral-history|title=Welcome to ''Jurassic Park'': An oral history|last1=Stack|first1=Tim|last2=Staskiewicz|first2=Keith|date=April 4, 2013|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cameron Thor]] had previously worked with Spielberg on ''Hook'', and initially auditioned for the role of Malcolm, before trying out for the role of Dodgson. Thor said about casting, "It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. I went with Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. I was so broke that I took the can home after the audition to use it."&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; [[Laura Dern]] was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler&lt;ref name=EW2013/&gt;  though she was not the only actress offered the part.

Ariana Richards said, "I was called into a casting office, and they just wanted me to scream.

===Filming===

After 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 65 and 67.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Costa Rica]] was considered as a location given it is the story's setting, Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility made him choose a place where he had already worked before.&lt;ref name=dawn /&gt; The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Nublar's forests.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; On September 11, [[Hurricane Iniki]] passed directly over Kaua{{okina}}i, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the storm scenes from the movie are actual footage shot during the hurricane. The scheduled shoot of the ''Gallimimus'' chase was moved to [[Kualoa Ranch]] on the island of [[Oahu]] and one of the beginning scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery.&lt;ref name="gallies" /&gt; The opening scene was shot in [[Haiku, Hawaii|Haiku]], on the island of [[Maui]],&lt;ref name="haiku"&gt;{{cite web | title=NBC Features Rappel Maui on 1st Look with Audrina Patridge | date=February 18, 2014 | author=MJ Harden | url=http://rappelmaui.com/blog/nbc-features-rappel-maui-1st-look/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional scenes being filmed on the "forbidden island" of [[Niihau]].&lt;ref name="greenie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Plantsman Confounds Greenies; Keith Robinson has a green thumb with endangered plants and a belief that the 'green' tactics used by the environmental establishment are a total waste of time |date=February 18, 2003 |author=Eric P.

By mid-September, the crew moved back to California,&lt;ref name="Earl doc"/&gt; to shoot the raptors in the kitchen at Stage 24 of the Universal studio lot.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; Given the kitchen set was filled with reflective surfaces, cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]] had to carefully plan the illumination while also using black cloths to hide the light reflections.&lt;ref name=pre/&gt; The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply, before going on location to [[Red Rock Canyon State Park (California)|Red Rock Canyon]] for the [[Montana]] dig scenes.&lt;ref name="location"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the ''Brachiosaurus'' encounter. The crew filmed scenes for the Park's labs and control room, which used animations for the computers lent from [[Silicon Graphics]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref name="triple cite"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 95–105.&lt;/ref&gt; While Crichton's book features [[Toyota]] cars in Jurassic Park, Spielberg got a deal with the [[Ford Motor Company]], who provided seven [[Ford Explorer]]s.&lt;ref name=shone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=All The Right Movies|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=November 29, 1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explorers were modified by ILM's crew and veteran customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] to create the illusion that they were [[autonomous car]]s by hiding the driver in the car's trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Barris TV and Movie Cars |page=41 |authors=Barris, George; Fetherston, David |publisher=MotorBooks International |year=1996 |ISBN=1-61060-818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barris also customized the [[Jeep Wrangler]]s featured in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Film Crew of Hollywood: Profiles of Grips, Cinematographers, Designers, a Gaffer, a Stuntman and a Makeup |page=174 |author=Udel, James C. |publisher=McFarland |year=2013 |isbn=0-7864-6484-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 15% of the film was shot in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic both at and Amber Museum and Mount Isabela de Torres. The crew moved to [[Warner Bros. Studios]]' Stage 16 to shoot the ''T. rex''{{'s}} attack on the LSX powered SUVs.&lt;ref name="triple cite" /&gt; Shooting proved frustrating because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic ''T. rex'' to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with [[chamois leather|shammy]]s between takes.&lt;ref name="big fan"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 110–1.&lt;/ref&gt; On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away.&lt;ref name="pre" /&gt; The ripples in the glass of water caused by the ''T. rex''{{'}}s footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put a glass of water on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 200 things that rocked our world|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=February 2006|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the ''Dilophosaurus'' on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center.&lt;ref name="dilo"&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the ''T. rex'', abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the ''T. rex'' saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a "King Kong roar" while an ironic banner reading "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" flew.&lt;ref name="pre" /&gt; The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Archerd |first = Army | title = Spielberg parks 'Jurassic' under sked, budget | work = Variety | date = December 1, 1992 | url =https://variety.com/1992/voices/columns/spielberg-parks-jurassic-under-sked-budget-1117862089/ | accessdate = January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within days, editor [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the title of the film's referencing the [[Jurassic]] period, ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' and ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' are the only dinosaurs featured that actually lived during that time; the other species featured did not exist until the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="dinomania"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen]] | title = Dinomania | work = The New York Review of Books | date = August 12, 1993 | url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/aug/12/dinomania/ | accessdate=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is acknowledged in the film during a scene where Dr. Grant describes the ferocity of the ''Velociraptor'' to a young boy, saying: "Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/life/go/dino-mite_2013-04-04.html?pagenum=full|title=Movies: Dino-mite!

Its vocal sounds were made by combining a [[swan]], a [[hawk]], a [[howler monkey]], and a [[rattlesnake]].&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; The animatronic model, nicknamed "Spitter" by Stan Winston's team, was animated by the puppeteers sitting on a trench in the set floor, and used a [[paintball]] mechanism to spit the mixture of [[Methyl cellulose|methacyl]] and [[K-Y Jelly]] that served as venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/making-jurassic-park-dilophosaurus-aka-spitter|title=JURASSIC PARK's Spitter – Building the animatronic Dilophosaurus dinosaur puppet|website=Stan Winston School of Character Arts|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Triceratops]]'' has an extended cameo, depicted as sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; Winston also created a baby ''Triceratops'' for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at [[Skywalker Ranch]] to create the ''Triceratops'' vocals.&lt;ref name=vult /&gt;
* ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' was acknowledged by Spielberg as "the star of the movie", and he  even rewrote the ending to feature the ''T. rex'' for fear of disappointing the audience.&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; Winston's animatronic ''T. rex'' stood {{convert|20|ft|m}}, weighed {{convert|17500|lb|kg}},&lt;ref name="triple cite" /&gt; and was {{convert|40|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="magic"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]] | title = Behind the Magic of Jurassic Park | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = April 26, 1993 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978307,00.html | accessdate = January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Horner called it "the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur".&lt;ref name="magic" /&gt; While the consulting paleontologists did not have a consensus on the dinosaur's movement, particularly regarding its running capabilities, animator [[Steve Williams (special effects artist)|Steve Williams]] decided to "throw physics out the window and create a ''T. rex'' that moved at sixty miles per hour even though its hollow bones would have busted if it ran that fast".&lt;ref&gt;Shone, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The major reason was the ''T. rex'' chasing a Jeep, a scene that took two months to finish.&lt;ref name="the end" /&gt; The dinosaur is depicted with a vision system based on movement, though later studies indicated the ''T. rex'' had [[binocular vision]] comparable to a [[bird of prey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sight+for+'saur+eyes%3A+T.+rex+vision+was+among+nature's+best.-a0148185715|title=Sight for 'saur eyes: T. rex vision was among nature's best.|work=[[Science News]]|author=Jaffe, Eric|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roar is a baby [[elephant]] mixed with a [[tiger]] and an [[alligator]], and its breath is a [[whale]]'s blow.&lt;ref name="the end" /&gt; A dog attacking a rope toy was used for the sounds of the ''T. rex'' tearing a ''Gallimimus'' apart,&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; while cut [[Sequoia (genus)|sequoias]] crashing to the ground became the sound of the dinosaur's footsteps.&lt;ref name=pre/&gt;
* ''[[Velociraptor]]'' plays a major role in the film. The creature's depiction is not based on the actual dinosaur genus in question, which was significantly smaller.

Special effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices:&lt;ref name="SIGCHI Dinosaur Input Device"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/papers/bk_bdy.htm | title=Dinosaur Input Device | author=Knep, Brian | author2=Hayes, Craig | author3=Sayre, Rick | author4=Williams, Tom | year=1995 | work=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | pages=304–309 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121054959/http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/papers/bk_bdy.htm | archivedate=November 21, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters like stop motion puppets. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and ''Gallimimus''. As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards' stunt double.&lt;ref name="Earl doc" /&gt; Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour.

The director described working simultaneously in two vastly different productions as "a bipolar experience", where he used "every ounce of intuition on ''Schindler's List'' and every ounce of craft in ''Jurassic Park''".&lt;ref name=next/&gt;

Along with the digital effects, Spielberg wanted the film to be the first with digital sound. He funded the creation of [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], which would allow audiences to "really hear the movie the way it was intended to be heard".&lt;ref name=next&gt;"Return to Jurassic Park: The Next Step in Evolution", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-ray (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The sound effects crew, supervised by [[George Lucas]],&lt;ref&gt;Shay, Duncan, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; were finished by the end of April.&lt;ref name="the end" /&gt; Sound designer [[Gary Rydstrom]] considered it a fun process, given the film had all kinds of noise – animal sounds, rain, gunshots, car crashes – and at times no music. During the process, Spielberg would take the weekends to fly from Poland to [[Paris]], where he would meet Rydstrom to see the sound progress.&lt;ref name=next/&gt; ''Jurassic Park'' was finally completed on May 28, 1993.&lt;ref name="the end" /&gt;

Composer [[John Williams]] began scoring the film at the end of February, and it was recorded a month later. John Neufeld and [[Alexander Courage]] provided the score's [[orchestrations]].&lt;ref name="the end"&gt;Shay, Duncan p. 144–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to another Spielberg film he scored, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Williams felt he needed to write "pieces that would convey a sense of 'awe' and fascination" given it dealt with the "overwhelming happiness and excitement" that would emerge from seeing live dinosaurs. In turn more suspenseful scenes such as the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack earned frightening themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8186 |title=The Making of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park|date=February 20, 2012|author=Siegel, Robert|publisher=Blu-Ray.com|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jurassic Park (film score)|first soundtrack album]] was released on May 25, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jurassic Park (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jurassic-park-mw0000097115|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, a new soundtrack was issued for [[Music download|digital download]] on April 9, 2013, including four bonus tracks personally selected by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://musicconnection.com/remastered-jurassic-park-soundtrack-includes-4-unreleased-john-williams-tracks/|title=Remastered Jurassic Park Soundtrack Includes 4 Unreleased John Williams Tracks|publisher=Universal Music Enterprises|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
High praise was given to the film's visual effects, musical score, and Spielberg's direction, although there was some criticism leveled at the script and departures from the book. [[Review aggregator|Review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave the film a "Certified Fresh" rating of 91%, based on 122 reviews, with a [[Weighted mean|rating average]] score of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Jurassic Park'' is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jurassic Park (1993) |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_park/ | accessdate = August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jurassic Park Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-park|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents...[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink= Janet Maslin | last = Maslin |first = Janet | title = Screen Stars With Teeth To Spare | work = The New York Times | date = June 11, 1993 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/movies/review-film-screen-stars-with-teeth-to-spare.html | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] described the film as "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink= Peter Travers | last = Travers | first =Peter | title = Jurassic Park | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 1993| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949029/review/5949030/jurassic_park| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824034910/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949029/review/5949030/jurassic_park| archivedate = August 24, 2007 | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] noted, "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink= Roger Ebert | last = Ebert | first= Roger | title = Jurassic Park | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = June 11, 1993 | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jurassic-park-1993 | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Sheehan argued, "The complaints over ''Jurassic Park'''s lack of story and character sound a little off the point," pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them.&lt;ref name="lack of story?" /&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of Jurassic Park| last= Westbrook | first= Caroline |journal=Empire|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/jurassic-park/review/|issue=50|date=August 1993|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following its release, ''Jurassic Park'' has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of the action and thriller genres. The [[American Film Institute]] named ''Jurassic Park'' the 35th-most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = AFI's 100 Years, 100 Thrills | publisher = AFI | date = June 13, 2001 | url = http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/thrills.aspx | accessdate = February 13, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208093605/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/thrills.aspx| archivedate = February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] also ranked ''Jurassic Park'' as the 55th-scariest movie of all time, and in 2005, [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] chose the scene in which Lex and Tim are stalked by two raptors in the kitchen as the 95th-scariest movie moment ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listal.com/list/cfca-100-scariest-movies-alltime |title=CFCA's ''100 Scariest Movies of All-Time'' |publisher=Chicago Film Critics Association|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 100 Scariest Movie Moments | publisher = Bravo TV | url = http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments//index.shtml | accessdate = February 13, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219070312/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments//index.shtml |archivedate = February 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 15th anniversary in 2004, it judged ''Jurassic Park'' the sixth-most influential film in the magazine's lifetime.&lt;ref name="influence"&gt;{{cite news|author=Freer, Ian |title=The 15 Most Influential Films Of Our Lifetime|page=120|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=April 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' called the first encounter with a ''Brachiosaurus'' the 28th-most magical moment in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Most Magical Movie Moments|page=122|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=November 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, an ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Braund|first=Simon|author2=Glen Ferris, Ian Freer, Nev Pierce, Chris Hewitt, Dan Jolin, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Helen O'Hara, Olly Richards, and Owen Willams|title=The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/52.asp|work=Empire|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Film Review (magazine)|Film Review]]''{{'}}s 55th anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review Special #59 – 55 Years Anniversary contents|publisher=Film Review|date=July 28, 2005|url=http://www.visimag.com/filmreview/fs59_display.htm|accessdate=March 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[IGN]] ranked ''Jurassic Park'' as the 19th-greatest film franchise ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Stax |author2=Linder, Brian |author3=Gilchrist, Todd |author4=Moro, Eric |author5=Carle, Chris |title=Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #19|publisher=IGN|date=November 30, 2006|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/30/top-25-movie-franchises-of-all-time-19|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 poll, the readers of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Summer Blockbusters: The New Generation", ''Entertainment Weekly'', Page 32, Issue #1112, July 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the movie caused the management of the [[National Basketball Association]] expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname [[Toronto Raptors|Raptors]].&lt;ref name="raph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html|title= Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto|accessdate=April 17, 2013|publisher=Toronto Raptors}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is seen as giving rise to the "Jurassic park" generation, to young people inspired to become paleontologists and to a surge in discoveries about dinosaurs in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Many Paleontologists Today Are Part Of The 'Jurassic Park' Generation |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/10/627782777/many-paleontologists-today-are-part-of-the-jurassic-park-generation |date=July 10, 2018 |website=NPR |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jurassic Park's'' biggest impact on subsequent films was a result of its [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated visual effects]]. Film historian [[Tom Shone]] commented on the film's innovation and influence, saying that "In its way, ''Jurassic Park'' heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927."&lt;ref&gt;Shone, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Many filmmakers saw ''Jurassic Park''{{'}}s effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible.&lt;ref name="influence" /&gt; ILM owner [[George Lucas]], realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, started to make the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Hearn| title ="ILM and the Digital Revolution" The Cinema of George Lucas| publisher =Harry N.

===Sequels and merchandise===

After the enormous success of the film, Spielberg asked Crichton to write a sequel novel, leading to the 1995 book ''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Lost World| publisher = MichaelCrichton.com| url = http://www.michaelcrichton.com/books-lostworld-video.html|access-date= July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, was adapted as the film ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''. Released on May 23, 1997, it was directed by Spielberg and written by David Koepp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Steven|title=In 'The Lost World,' Bits of Old Movies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-29/entertainment/ca-63567_1_world-lost-movies|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film, ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', was released on July 18, 2001, under the direction of [[Joe Johnston]], with Spielberg as executive producer, featuring an original script that incorporated ultimate unused elements from Crichton's original ''Jurassic Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Making of Jurassic Park III |publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|location=''Jurassic Park III'' DVD |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth installment, ''[[Jurassic World]]'', was released in theaters on June 12, 2015. Spielberg again produced, with [[Colin Trevorrow]] directing a script written by himself and [[Derek Connolly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Jurassic World' is Trevorrow Land |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jurassic-world-director-20150611-story.html#page=1/ |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |author=Rottenberg, Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'' is the next film in the franchise, and was released in June 2018.

The story of the film was also continued in auxiliary media, at times even unattached to the film sequels themselves. These included a series of ''Jurassic Park'' [[comic book]]s written by [[Steve Englehart]] for [[Topps Comics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jurassic Park | publisher = stevenenglehart.com | url = http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Jurassic%20Park.html | accessdate=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and video games such as Ocean Software's ''[[Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues]]'' (1994), [[Vivendi]]'s ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' (2003) and [[Telltale Games]]' ''[[Jurassic Park: The Game]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="games"&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty years on after Jurassic Park's release, a look back at the video games inspired by the dinosaur franchise|date=June 11, 2013|author=Meikleham, Dave| work=[[Daily Mirror]] |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/film/jurassic-park-twenty-years-after-1945689|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Sahi Hai''''' is an Indian coming of age comedy [[web series]] from the guys who gave ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama]]''. It is produced by [[Luv Ranjan]] and [[Ankur Garg]] under their company [[Luv Films]] and is created by [[Tarun Jain]] (co-writer of ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2]]'').

== Plot summary ==
''Life Sahi Hai'' is a sitcom that revolves around the lives of four guys who have moved to Delhi to live independently for the first time. They have a tendency to land in uncomfortable and what for us are hilarious, situations all the time. While dealing with bosses, girlfriends and with each other, these guys end up in such challenging situations, which only they are capable of landing themselves in. While they are getting used to the newfound freedom, they realize that freedom isn’t free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/pyaar-ka-punchnama-2-boys-introduce-life-sahi-hai-cast-2806581/|title=Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 boys introduce Life Sahi Hai cast|date=18 May 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite all this, they can see the lighter side of life in everything, and keep believing that ‘Life Sahi Hai’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koimoi.com/videos/watch-the-youthful-trailer-of-life-sahi-hai-season-1/|title=Watch The Youthful Trailer Of Life Sahi Hai&amp;nbsp;— Season 1 - Koimoi|first=Koimoi.com|last=Team|work=Koimoi.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9101">[[File:Lledo_Model_T_with_Reese's_livery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ford Model T delivery van. This model was used for more than 170 different liveries.]]
'''Lledo''' was a brand of [[die cast toy]]s, founded in 1982 by [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] co-founder [[Jack Odell]] and [[Burt Russell]] (Co-founder 2007). The factory produced diecast vehicles in Enfield, England from 1983 to 1999. Models were later made in China. Lledo was a reversal of Odell's own surname, a mnemonic device from war days in the African desert so as not to forget his wireless call sign (About Lledo 2005-2011; Force 1988).

==History==

===Days Gone===
Lledo set out to specialize in replicating early Matchbox series styles, particularly the Models of Yesteryear range. Odell and Russell bought machinery from the Universal company, which had purchased the Matchbox plant and shipped it to Macau. The tooling they purchased was re-shipped back to [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield, England]] where in April 1983 the new  '''Days Gone''' range was launched. The name is a nice continuation of Matchbox's nostalgic "Yesteryear" theme.

The first Lledo models appeared on the market in early 1983. These were a horse-drawn tram, a horse-drawn milk float, a horse-drawn delivery van, a stagecoach-like omnibus, and a horse-drawn fire engine (Force 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–12, 128). One of the more popular models was the [[Ford Model T]] van introduced later in the year.

===Lledo promotionals===
The promotional market became Lledo's bread and butter, and the aim was to provide variations to be offered for different businesses. Of the hundreds of Lledo variations appearing in the first six years of production, all were based on only thirty basic castings (Johnson 1998, 115).

The Model T, especially, became the basis for a series of limited edition models for gifts and promotions. Different from the original Matchbox Models of Yesteryear line, there were only a selection of basic castings which were commonly produced in limited edition promotion runs of 500 or 1000 models. For example, the basic Model T delivery van was produced in more than 170 different liveries (Force 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–21). Meanwhile, the horse-drawn vehicles were produced less and less, the last one appearing in 1984 (Force 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;128–129). The London Double Decker bus was a popular promotional; it appeared in many forms like "Vimto-Keeps you Fit", "Madame Tassaud's Wax Museum", or the "Boys Brigade" model whose intent was to raise funds to provide safe drinking water for third world countries (Rixon 2005, p. 57). Another promotional example was the VW Transporter van which appeared in Pepsi, 7 Up and Bosch spark plugs liveries, amongst many others (Johnson 1998, p. 116). 

To distinguish promos from traditional "Days Gone" series models, model baseplates were differentiated. Either "Days Gone" or "Lledo Promotional Model" began to appear on the chassis, according to need.(Force 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;129). Most models were produced by Lledo, but several 'Code Two' models were manufactured and sold to second parties for label and logo application previously agreed to by Lledo (Force 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;129).

==Other lines==

===Foreign marketers===
Some Lledos were sold in the U.S. under the Hartoys name, headquartered in Florida, and mainly selling a series of trucks to be sold in supermarkets and drug stores. One of these Hartoys lines was called the "Fantastic Set o' Wheels". Perhaps because of the diecast expense, these did not last long and did not become popular, despite fine craftsmanship and notable brand liveries. By the early 1990s, Hartoys was using Chinese diecasters to continue to make quality models, now called the "American Highway Legends" (AHL). One example was the 1939 International A&amp;P truck. Other Lledos were marketed in the Netherlands under the Edocar name.

===Land speed record===
[[Image:Railton Mobil Special Lledo toy.JPG|thumb|right|[[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]]'s '[[Railton Mobil Special]]'|240px]]
In 1993, Lledo partnered with Kellogg's cereals in the U.K. to produce a set of four land speed record cars (Haas 2011). Called "Land Speed Legends", the vehicles included the 1935 Sir Malcolm Campbell-Railton Blue Bird (the first car to break 300 miles per hour); the Railton Mobil Special driven by John Cobb; Craig Breedlove's second Spirit of America, and Richard Noble's [[Thrust 2]] which held the Land Speed Record from 1983 to 1997.
[[Image:Bluebird 1935 Lledo toy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Campbell-Railton Blue Bird|1935 Blue Bird]] land speed record car|240px]]
These models were a big departure from the multiple-livery classic vehicle fare that Lledo normally made - they were entirely new castings and were not subsequently reproduced in any other promotional form (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;57). The models were in varied scales from 1:80 to 1:100 (the real cars were very large). The promotion packed all four models together and included a foldout poster of specifications and land speed record events (Haas 2011). Though Lledo also made a fifth land speed record car replica of the record-breaking Thrust SSC piloted by Andy Green, the company did not often return to such deviations from its 'liveried classics' format.

===Vanguards===
Lledo launched the '''Vanguards''' range in 1996, which specialized in replica classic British cars, and later, other European vehicles. The first model was the fourth update of the Ford Anglia (1959-1968) (Anglia Models 2002-2012). With Hillmans, Jowetts, Wolseleys, Rovers, Triumphs, Vauxhalls, Austins, Morrises and Jaguars, many traditional British marques were represented and the line grew to more than 40 different vehicles.

The Vanguard line, often called the "Fifties and Sixties Classic Collection" was notable for keen attention to detail. For example, the handsome Sunbeam Alpine Mark II featured accurate decals for logos and scripts on the body of the car, chrome petrol cap, door handles, and trunk hinges. Body colored rims with whitewall tires added to the sophistication of  the finished model. Rear view mirror and accurate windshield wipers were also offered.  Like many Lledo models, the Alpine came with rear view mirrors separate that could then be affixed to the car.  To put the car back in the box one had to remove the mirrors - so a word of advice - don't glue them on the car (Rixon 2005, p. 81).

British trucks were also produced in this line including Ford Transit vans and Ford Thames Trader truck, Commer dropside, Morris commercial van, Dennis F8 fire engine, Bedford S Type trucks, Land Rover LWB and Defender and Karrier boxback, among others. Later, the Volkswagen Transporter van was included in many different liveries - for example in bright yellow with the Bosch Auto Electrical logo.  Vanguards were a departure from earlier Lledos, as they were produced in a consistent 1:43 scale.

==Company Fate==

Although shipping high volumes of product, the company could not compete against low cost producers from Hong Kong and China who also entered the special promotions market with high quality products. As a result, Lledo went bankrupt in 1999, and the naming rights and model range were bought by [[Corgi Classics Limited|Corgi]] which continued producing Lledo models in China until 2005, when the remaining models were merged into the Corgi Classics range.

Jack Odell died on 8 July 2007 at the age of 87 (Co-founder 2007). His venerable Lledo range was among the last (if not ''the'' last) mass production diecast manufacturer to make its products in the British Isles (or the last within Europe for that matter).

[[Image:Topo&amp;Jimini-wedding1.jpg|thumb|The Royal Drag -Topo and Jimini are married in drag on the same day as Prince Charles and Lady Di]]
'''Los Topos''' was a subversive, community theater group in California during the 1970s. They named themselves after the Spanish word for "mole" (topo), referring to their undergroup activities. One member of this group even adopted Topo as his stage name. He later specialised in 'robotics' miming mechanical robots. Together with [[Jimini Hignett]] he formed his own fringe company 'Christians from Outer Space' performing satirical theatre together, and on July 29, 1981 (the same day as [[Prince Charles]] and [[Lady Diana]]) they were married - he dressed as Diana, Jimini as Charles. At the wedding - dubbed ‘The Royal Drag’ by the ''Soho News'' - all guests are also cross-dressed (the Queen Mum sporting an enormous hairy back and a hat made from pizza boxes). The preacher at first refuses to conduct the ceremony, thinking they were both men. The event is shown on the Channel 7{{which|date=June 2013}} TV-news.

== History ==
The origin of the phrase has been attributed to the [[MTV]] Network itself "to describe the teenagers that dominate their ratings".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Pauling, "Engaging the Digital Natives", in Terry Evans, et al., ''International Handbook of Distance Education'' (Emerald Group Publishing, 2008) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase came into general use more than two years after the cable network's 1981 debut.  One observer notes that "By 1984, MTV was reaching 1.2 percent of the daily television audience, and more than a quarter of daily teen viewers.  Children of the eighties would henceforth be known as 'the MTV Generation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Steve Greenberg, "Where Is Graceland?: 1980s Pop Culture", in Gil Troy and  Vincent J. Cannato, ''Living in the Eighties: Viewpoints on American Culture'' (Oxford University Press US, 2009) p159&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as its October 13, 1984 issue, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' Magazine]] was using the term in reference to musical preferences.&lt;ref&gt;"DeBurgh Drawing Teen Devotees", by Sam Sutherland, ''Billboard'' 10.13.1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later expanded to include the purchasing choices of a generation of consumers, with the J.

MTV broadcast a documentary titled ''MTV Generation'' in 1991. Reviewing it, the ''[[New York Times]]'' described the group as "young adults struggling to establish a cultural niche for themselves, something that will distinguish them from the hippies and baby boomers and yuppies of times past." The documentary depicts the MTV Generation as characterised by cynicism, uncertainty, and an ability to process information quickly, and focusing on diversions and retro interests.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/06/arts/review-television-on-mtv-talking-about-the-mtv-generation.html?pagewanted=1|title=On MTV, Talking About the MTV Generation|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=6 November 1991|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Much has been written about the so-called "baby buster" generation—the fairly anonymous group of 20ish young adults struggling to separate themselves from the shadow of the baby boomers ... The group's newest moniker, "the MTV generation," might be the most accurate description yet. For while much has been made about the generation's lack of a single unifying theme or experience, its members seem to have one thing in common: music videos."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-10/news/tv-1845_1_mtv-generation|title=The Shaping of a Shapeless Generation: Does MTV Unify a Group Known Otherwise For its Sheer Diversity?|last=Lipton|first=Lauren|date=10 November 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, author [[Douglas Coupland]] said of the label: "MTV would like to have us believe that everyone in their 20s is the MTV Generation. That's like going through life with a big product placement tattooed on your head, as if they're the only cultural influence on the entire planet." Coupland also said MTV had a mostly positive and profound impact on his generation. In 1991 he stated, "I was in Europe last summer and MTV is everywhere. It's in the bars, in the homes, in the coffee shops. I didn't realize how completely global it was and what it has done to homogenize youth culture."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

'''Ma'jonga''' is a traditional [[horse riding]] and [[hunting]] competition from [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].

== History ==

At the time of many kingdoms still held the power in South Sulawesi, [[horse]] competition was a great value of [[pride]]. Skill of riding horse was the absolute prerequirement to participate in Ma’jonga or hunting [[deer]] event which was organized by king. To the common people, Ma’jonga was the moment where they could show their hunting skill and could raise their lower status to higher status as well. 
Ma’jonga competition was usually arranged by a king for his family pleasure. It was arranged in the yard inside the jungle. Deer from jungle were driven into the yard for being hunted by hunters. While the king and noblemen were watching from a tower.
Hunters were riding their horses and holding ''tado'', a wooden stick with [[lasso]] in its tip for catching deer. Tough chasing after deer requires a lot of shrewdness, more a hunter became shrewd both riding and catching dee, more the respects he got.

== Recent event ==

Actually riding horse tradition can be found in every village or town in [[Sulawesi]]. From [[Manado]] in the north to [[Jeneponto]] in the south, where is best known as '''horse village'''.
The tradition has survived for hundred of years until to now in South Sulawesi, but we will face it in the different style now. Formerly it was a hunting event but now it was organized only for amusement and performance event. It became the predilection or [[hobby]] for many people from children to adult. Much of the horses’ [[jockeys]] are adolescents or younger people. They usually came from traditional horse [[breeder]] family. People regarded horse as symbol of masculinity.

Riding horse event once has been absent for over 20 years, because it was identical with [[gambling]]. In December 2006, lastly it was opened in [[Makassar]]'s Parangtambung [[hippodrome]].

'''''Mad Movies with the L.A. Connection''''' is a 1985 [[television syndication|syndicated]] television show produced by the comedy troupe the L.A. Connection. Every episode is a spoof of a classic movie where the video is the original (although edited to fit the show's half-hour format) but all the dialogue is [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|overdubbed]] with humorous dialogue written and voiced by the L.A. Connection, in a manner similar to Woody Allen's feature-length film ''[[What's Up Tiger Lily|What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]''. During one season, 26 half-hour episodes were produced. Before producing the series, the L.A. Connection did live comedy dubbing of films at the Ken Theater in San Diego and the [[Nuart Theater]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/not-quite-the-movies/mad-movies/ |title=Mad Movies With The L.A.

The original run was syndicated to local stations by [[Four Star Television]] during the 1985-1986 television season; it was later seen in reruns on [[Nick at Nite]] from 1987 to 1989. The theme was performed by Mary Newland.

A '''major film studio''' is a [[filmmaking|production]] and [[film distributor|distribution]] company that releases a substantial number of [[film]]s annually and consistently commands a significant share of [[box office]] revenue in a given market. In the American and international markets, the major film studios, often simply known as the '''majors''', are commonly regarded as the six diversified [[media conglomerate]]s whose various film production and distribution subsidiaries collectively command approximately 80–85% of U.S. box office revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Edward Jay|title=The Big Picture: Money And Power in Hollywood|date=2006|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780812973822|pages=14–19, 82, 109, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettig|first1=Ronald V.|author2=Jeanne Lynn Hall|title=Big Media, Big Money: Cultural Texts and Political Economics|date=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9781442204294|pages=59–108|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary motion picture business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate.

The "[[#Majors|Big Six]]" majors are all [[film studios]] active since [[classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's Golden Age]]. Three of them – [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], and [[20th Century Fox]] – were members of the "Big Five", but the other three – [[Universal Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] – did not gain their market shares until much later. The former two were part of the "Little Three" in the next tier down, and the latter one was an independent production company during the Golden Age. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] were the other two Golden Age "Big Five" majors, that exist today only as a mini-major and a small independent company. [[United Artists]] was a distribution company for several independent producers during the Golden Age, later began producing films, grew to major status, then merged with MGM.

While the main studios of the Big Six are located within {{convert|15|miles|km}} of each other, Disney is the only one that has been owned by the same conglomerate since its founding and is also the sole member whose parent entity is still located near [[Los Angeles]] on [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney's studio lot]] and [[Team Disney|in the same building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Brooks|title=Disney Film Boss Ousted by Warner Finds Vindication in Success|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/business/media/alan-horn-rights-the-ship-at-disney-and-fortune-follows.html|accessdate=9 November 2014|work=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Brooks|title=In Hollywood, a Decade of Hits Is No Longer Enough|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/business/27steal.html|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where as the five others were previously owned by many different companies years ago and now report to conglomerates that are respectively located elsewhere in  [[Boston]] (Paramount), [[Dallas]] (Warner Bros.), [[New York City]] (Fox), [[Philadelphia]] (Universal), and [[Tokyo]] (Columbia); moreover, Disney and Columbia are the only ones whose parent companies are still headquartered near the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Paramount is the only one still based ''in'' Hollywood with Columbia being in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] and Fox in [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]]; furthermore, Paramount, Columbia, and Fox are the only ones still located within and near the Los Angeles [[city limits]]. Both Disney and Warner Bros. are located in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and Universal is in the unincorporated area of [[Universal City, California|Universal City]].

Most of today's Big Six also control subsidiaries with their own distribution networks that concentrate on [[art film|arthouse]] pictures (e.g. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]) or [[B movie|genre films]] (e.g. [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[Screen Gems]]); several of these specialty units were shut down or sold off between 2008 and 2010. The six major studios are contrasted with smaller production and/or distribution companies, which are known as independents or "indies". The leading independent producer/distributors such as [[Lionsgate]], and [[STX Entertainment]] are sometimes referred to as "mini-majors". From 1998 through 2005, [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks SKG]] commanded a large enough market share to arguably qualify it as a seventh major, despite its relatively small output. In 2006, DreamWorks was acquired by [[Viacom]], Paramount's corporate parent. In late 2008, DreamWorks once again became an independent production company; its films were distributed by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] until 2016, at which point distribution switched to Universal.

The Big Six major studios are today primarily backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies &amp;ndash; either long-running entities or ones created for and dedicated to the making of a specific film. The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures in which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production, their activities are focused more in the areas of development, financing, marketing, and merchandising. Those business functions are still usually performed in or near Los Angeles, even though the [[runaway production]] phenomenon means that most films are now mostly or completely shot [[location shooting|on location]] at places outside Los Angeles.

Since [[History of film|the dawn of filmmaking]], the U.S. major film studios have dominated both [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]] and the global [[film industry]]. U.S. studios have benefited from a strong [[first-mover advantage]] in that they were the first to industrialize filmmaking and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality films with broad cross-cultural appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flew|first1=Terry|title=The Creative Industries: Culture and Policy|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=9781446273081|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Big Six majors routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all significant international markets (that is, where [[Disposable and discretionary income|discretionary income]] is high enough for consumers to afford to watch films). It is very rare, if not impossible, for a film to reach a broad international audience on multiple continents and in multiple languages without being picked up by one of the majors for distribution.

[[The Weinstein Company]] was founded in late 2005 by brothers [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] after their departure from [[Miramax Films]], which they had founded in 1979. In 1993, they sold control of Miramax to the Walt Disney Company, continuing to run the studio in quasi-independent fashion under the Disney umbrella. When the Weinsteins left Disney, they retained the right to the [[Dimension Films]] brand, which is used by The Weinstein Company (as it was by Miramax) for genre films.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], after decades as a major studio, continues to distribute motion pictures and television content as a minor, privately held media company. In April 2005, it was purchased from [[Kirk Kerkorian]]'s [[Tracinda Corporation]] by a consortium including Sony, cable company [[Comcast]] (who now owns [[Universal Pictures]]), [[Providence Equity Partners]], and three other private investment firms.

==History==
===The majors before the Golden Age===&lt;!--  This section is linked from [[Sound film]] --&gt;
In 1909, [[Thomas Edison]], who had been fighting in the courts for years for control of fundamental motion picture patents, won a major decision. This led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], widely known as the Trust. Comprising the nine largest U.S. film companies, it was "designed to eliminate not only independent film producers but also the country's 10,000 independent [distribution] exchanges and exhibitors."&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Though its many members did not consolidate their filmmaking operations, the New York–based Trust was arguably the first major North American movie conglomerate. The independents' fight against the Trust was led by [[Carl Laemmle]], whose Chicago-based Laemmle Film Service, serving the Midwest and Canada, was the largest distribution exchange in North America. Laemmle's efforts were rewarded in 1912 when the U.S. government ruled that the Trust was a "corrupt and unlawful association" and must be dissolved. On June 8, 1912, Laemmle organized the merger of his production division, IMP (Independent Motion Picture Company), with several other filmmaking companies, creating the [[Universal Pictures|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] in [[New York City]]. By the end of the year, Universal was making movies at two Los Angeles facilities: the former Nestor Film studio in Hollywood, and another studio in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale]]. The first Hollywood major was in business.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, a second powerful Hollywood studio was established when [[Adolph Zukor]] merged his [[Famous Players Film Company]] movie production house with the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse L. Lasky Company]] to form [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The combined studio acquired [[Paramount Pictures]] as a distribution arm and eventually adopted its name. That same year, [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] relocated his [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] from [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] to Hollywood and began expanding.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas and Solomon (1985), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, four brothers—[[Harry Warner|Harry]], [[Albert Warner|Albert]],  [[Sam Warner|Sam]], and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]—founded the [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|first Warner Brothers Studio]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Hollywood. On April 4, 1923, the Warner Brothers incorporated their fledgling movie company as "[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc.]]"

The Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers' Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy — the "film trust" of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], Paramount, and [[First National Pictures|First National]], which they claimed dominated the industry by not only producing and distributing motion pictures, but by entering into exhibition as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Owners Open War on Hays", ''The New York Times'', May 12, 1925, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 1927, Warner Bros. released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', starring [[Al Jolson]], and a whole new era began, with "pictures that talked," bringing the Studio to the forefront of the film industry. ''The Jazz Singer'' played to standing-room-only crowds throughout the country and earned a special [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner Bros. held 42,000 shares of common stock out of 72,000 outstanding shares, while Fox Pictures held 21,000 shares, and 12,000 shares were publicly held. *"Warner Buys First National", The Wall Street Journal, September 27, 1928, p. 3. Fox sold its shares of First National to Warner Bros. in November 1929. 
*"Fox Holdings in First National Pictures Sold", The Washington Post, November 4, 1929, p. 3.
8.^
*"Film Concern Dissolves", The New York Times, July 12, 1936, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox, in the forefront of sound film along with Warners, was also acquiring a sizable circuit of movie theaters to exhibit its product.

Between late 1928, when [[RCA]]'s [[David Sarnoff]] engineered the creation of the [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) studio, and the end of 1949, when Paramount divested its theater chain—roughly the period considered Hollywood's Golden Age—there were eight Hollywood studios commonly regarded as the "majors".&lt;ref name=F364/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Film Daily | title=230 Pix On Season's Production Charts Ready | date=January 3, 1939 | pages=1, 3| url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily75wids#page/n3/mode/2up | accessdate=December 26, 2015}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these eight, the so-called Big Five were integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Loew's/MGM, Paramount, Fox (which became 20th Century-Fox after a 1935 merger), Warner Bros., and RKO. The remaining majors were sometimes referred to as the "Little Three" or "major minor" studios.&lt;ref name=tss/&gt; Two—Universal and Columbia (founded in 1924)—were organized similarly to the Big Five, except for the fact that they never owned more than small theater circuits (a consistently reliable source of profits). The third of the lesser majors, United Artists (founded in 1919), owned a few theaters and had access to production facilities owned by its principals, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films. During the 1930s, the eight majors averaged a total of 358 feature film releases a year; in the 1940s, the four largest companies shifted more of their resources toward high-budget productions and away from [[B movies]], bringing the yearly average down to 288 for the decade.&lt;ref name=F364&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 364–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the significant characteristics of the Golden Age was the stability of the Hollywood majors, their hierarchy, and their near-complete domination of the box office. At the midpoint of the Golden Age, 1939, the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); each of the Little Three had around a 7% share. In sum, the eight majors controlled 95% of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 5%. Ten years later, the picture was largely the same: the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22% (MGM) to 9% (RKO); the Little Three had shares ranging from 8% (Columbia) to 4% (United Artists). In sum, the eight majors controlled 96% of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950s–1960s====
The end of the Golden Age had been signaled by the majors' loss of a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust case]] that led to the divestiture of the Big Five's theater chains. Though this had virtually no immediate effect on the eight majors' box-office domination, it somewhat leveled the playing field between the Big Five and the Little Three. In November 1951, [[Decca Records]] purchased 28% of Universal; early the following year, the studio became the first of the classic Hollywood majors to be taken over by an outside corporation, as Decca acquired majority ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s saw two substantial shifts in the hierarchy of the majors: RKO, perennially the weakest of the Big Five, declined rapidly under the mismanagement of [[Howard Hughes]], who had purchased a controlling interest in the studio in 1948. By the time Hughes sold it to the [[General Tire|General Tire and Rubber Company]] in 1955, the studio was a major by outdated reputation alone. In 1957, virtually all RKO movie operations ceased and the studio was dissolved in 1959. (Revived on a small scale in 1981, it was eventually spun off and now operates as a minor independent company.) In contrast, there was United Artists, which had long operated under the financing-distribution model the other majors were now progressively shifting toward. Under [[Arthur Krim]] and Robert Benjamin, who began managing the company in 1951, UA became consistently profitable. By 1956—when it released one of the biggest blockbusters of the decade, ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''—it commanded a 10% market share. By the middle of the next decade, it had reached 16% and was the second-most profitable studio in Hollywood. Despite RKO's collapse, the majors still averaged a total yearly release slate of 253 feature films during the decade.&lt;ref name=F364/&gt;

The 1960s were marked by a spate of corporate takeovers. [[MCA Inc.]], under [[Lew Wasserman]], acquired Universal in 1962; [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Wester]]n took over Paramount in 1966; and the [[Transamerica Corporation]] purchased United Artists in 1967. Warner Bros. underwent large-scale reorganization twice in two years: a 1967 merger with the [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]] company preceded a 1969 purchase by [[Kinney National Company|Kinney National]], under [[Stephen J. Ross]]. MGM, in the process of a slow decline, changed ownership twice in the same span as well, winding up in the hands of financier [[Kirk Kerkorian]]. The majors almost entirely abandoned low-budget production during this era, bringing the annual average of features released down to 160.&lt;ref name=F364/&gt; The decade also saw an old name in the industry secure a position as a leading player. In 1923, [[Walt Disney]] had founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio with his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]] and animator [[Ub Iwerks]]. Over the following three decades Disney became a powerful independent focusing on animation and, from the late 1940s, an increasing number of live-action movies. In 1954, the company—now [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]—established [[Buena Vista Distribution|Buena Vista Film Distribution]] to handle its own product, which had been distributed for years by various majors, primarily United Artists and then RKO. (Disney's 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', released by RKO, was the second biggest hit of the 1930s.) In its first year, Buena Vista had a major success with ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', the third biggest movie of 1954. In 1964, Buena Vista had its first blockbuster, ''[[Mary Poppins (1964 film)|Mary Poppins]]'', Hollywood's biggest hit in half a decade. The company achieved a 9% market share that year, more than Fox and Warner Bros. Though over the next two decades, Disney/Buena Vista's share of the box-office would again hit similar marks, its relatively small output and exclusive focus on family movies meant that it was not generally considered a major.

====1970s–1980s====
The early 1970s were difficult years for ''all'' the majors. Movie attendance, which had been declining steadily since the Golden Age, hit an all-time low in 1971. In 1973, MGM president [[James T. Aubrey, Jr.|James T. Aubrey Jr.]] drastically downsized the studio, slashing its production schedule and eliminating its distribution arm (UA would distribute the studio's films for the remainder of the decade). From fifteen releases in 1973, the next year MGM was down to five; its average for the rest of the 1970s would be even lower.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 155, 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Like RKO in its last days under Hughes, MGM remained a major in terms of brand reputation, but little more. MGM, however, was not the only studio to trim its release line. By the mid-1970s, the industry had rebounded and a significant philosophical shift was in progress. As the majors focused increasingly on the development of the next hoped-for blockbuster and began routinely opening each new movie in many hundreds of theaters (an approach called "saturation booking"), their collective yearly release average fell to 81 films during 1975–84.&lt;ref name=F364/&gt; The classic set of majors was shaken further in late 1980, when the disastrously expensive flop of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' effectively ruined United Artists. The studio was sold the following year to Kerkorian, who merged it with MGM. After a brief resurgence, the combined studio again declined. From the mid-1980s on, MGM/UA has been at best a "mini-major", to use the present-day term.

Meanwhile, a new member was finally admitted to the club of major studios and two significant contenders emerged. With the establishment of its Touchstone Pictures brand and increasing attention to the adult market in the mid-1980s, Disney/Buena Vista secured acknowledgment as a full-fledged major.&lt;ref name="tss" /&gt; Film historian Joel Finler identifies 1986 as the breakthrough year, when Disney rose to third place in market share and remained consistently competitive for a leading position thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 324–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The two contenders were both newly formed companies. In 1978, Krim, Benjamin, and three other studio executives departed UA to found [[Orion Pictures]] as a joint venture with Warner Bros. It was announced optimistically as the "first major new film company in 50 years".&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tri-Star Pictures]] was created in 1982 as a joint venture of Columbia Pictures (then owned by the [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola Company]]), [[HBO]] (then owned by [[Time Inc.]]), and [[CBS]]. In 1985, [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] acquired 20th Century-Fox, the last of the five relatively healthy Golden Age majors to remain independent throughout the entire Golden Age and after.

In 1986, the combined share of the six classic majors—at that point Paramount, Warner Bros., Columbia, Universal, Fox, and MGM/UA—fell to 64%, the lowest since the beginning of the Golden Age. Disney was in third place, behind only Paramount and Warner Bros.. Even including it as a seventh major and adding its 10% share, the majors' control of the North American market was at a historic ebb. Orion, now completely independent of Warner Bros., and Tri-Star were well positioned as mini-majors, each with North American market shares of around 6% and regarded by industry observers as "fully competitive with the majors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=VCRs Sending People Back to Theaters| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=1987-05-10|author=Thompson, Anne | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller independents garnered 13%—more than any studio aside from Paramount. In 1964, by comparison, all of the companies beside the then seven majors and Disney had combined for a grand total of 1%. In the first edition of Finler's ''The Hollywood Story'' (1988), he wrote, "It will be interesting to see whether the old-established studios will be able to bounce back in the future, as they have done so many times before, or whether the newest developments really do reflect a fundamental change in the US movie industry for the first times since the 20s."&lt;ref&gt;Finler (1988), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s–present====
With the exception of MGM/UA—whose position was effectively filled by Disney—the old-established studios ''did'' bounce back. The purchase of [[20th Century Fox]] by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] presaged a new round of corporate acquisitions. Between 1989 and 1994, Paramount, Warner Bros., Columbia, and Universal all changed ownership in a series of conglomerate purchases and mergers that brought them new financial and marketing muscle. Paramount's parent company [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]] was renamed Paramount Communications in 1989 and was merged with Viacom five years later. [[Warner Communications]] merged with [[Time Inc.]] to give birth to the conglomerate [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]. Coca-Cola sold Columbia to Japanese electronics firm [[Sony]] also in 1989. And Universal's parent [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] was purchased by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]]. By the early 1990s, both Tri-Star and Orion were essentially out of business: the former consolidated into Columbia, the latter bankrupt and sold to MGM. The most important contenders to emerge during the 1990s, [[New Line Cinema]], [[Miramax]], and [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks SKG]], were likewise sooner or later brought into the majors' fold, though DreamWorks and Miramax are now independent again.

The development of in-house pseudo-indie subsidiaries by the conglomerates—sparked by the 1992 establishment of [[Sony Pictures Classics]] and the success of ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), Miramax's first project under Disney ownership—significantly undermined the position of the true independents. The majors' release schedule rebounded: the six primary studio subsidiaries alone put out a total of 124 films during 2006; the three largest secondary subsidiaries (New Line, Fox Searchlight, and Focus Features) accounted for another 30. Box-office domination was fully restored: in 2006, the six major movie conglomerates combined for 89.8% of the North American market; Lionsgate and Weinstein were almost exactly half as successful as their 1986 mini-major counterparts, sharing 6.1%; MGM came in at 1.8%; and all of the remaining independent companies split a pool totaling 2.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/studio/?view=company&amp;view2=yearly&amp;yr=2006&amp;p=.htm Studio Market Share (2006)] part of ''BoxOfficeMojo.com''. Retrieved May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one of the major studios changed corporate hands during the first decade of the 2000s, though it did so three times: Universal was acquired by [[Vivendi]] in 2000, then by [[General Electric]] four years later, and finally by [[Comcast]] in 2011. More developments took place among the majors' subsidiaries. The very successful animation production house [[Pixar]], whose films were distributed by Buena Vista, was acquired by Disney in 2006. In 2008, New Line Cinema lost its independent status within Time Warner and became a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Time Warner also announced that it would be shutting down its two specialty units, Warner Independent and Picturehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hayes, Dade |author2=Dave McNary |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Picturehouse, WIP to Close Shop |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985299.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |date=2008-05-08|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 as well, Paramount Vantage's production, marketing, and distribution departments were folded into the parent studio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldsmith, Jill |author2=Tatiana Siegel  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Viacom Lays Off 850 Staffers |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996816.html?categoryid=3284&amp;cs=1 |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it retained the brand for release purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Paramount Vantage Acquires Worldwide Rights |publisher=Paramount |url=http://www.paramount.com/news/press-releases/paramount-vantage-acquires-worldwide-rights-to-the-new-film-by-oscar®-winning-documentarian-davis-gu |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ng, Philiana |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/paramount-vantage-sets-release-date-179119 |title=Paramount Vantage Sets Release Date for Sundance Winner 'Like Crazy' |work=Hollywood Reporter| date=2011-04-15 | accessdate=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal sold off its genre specialty division, Rogue Pictures, to [[Relativity Media]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Borys, Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7fcfe6ddd3b5d6c23c7d5bc685b4e12d |title=Relativity Completes Rogue Acquisition |work=Hollywood Reporter | date=2009-01-04 | accessdate=2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney closed down Miramax's operations in January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Waxman, Sharon |url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/rip-miramax-13606 |title=Miramax Dies: Rest in Peace |publisher=The Wrap| date=2010-01-27 | accessdate=2010-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold off the unit and its library that July to an investor group led by Ronald N.

'''''Max Payne''''' is a [[third-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Remedy Entertainment]] and published by [[Gathering of Developers]] in July 2001 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Ports created later in the year for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and the [[Game Boy Advance]] were published by [[Rockstar Games]]. A [[Mac OS]] port was published on 16 July 2002 by [[MacSoft]] in North America and [[Feral Interactive]] in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="MacPublish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4playernetwork.com/gamesdb/game/max-payne/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140813095921/http://4playernetwork.com/gamesdb/game/max-payne/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2014 |title=Max Payne on 4Player Network |accessdate=13 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans for a [[Dreamcast]] version of ''Max Payne'', but they were canceled due to the discontinuation of the console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.dreamcast.ign.com/articles/132/132175p1.html |title=Max Payne Dreamcast details |date=27 July 1999 |author=[[IGN]] |accessdate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026145011/http://uk.dreamcast.ign.com/articles/132/132175p1.html |archivedate=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was re-released on 27 April 2009 as a downloadable game in the [[Xbox Originals]] program for the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Treit|title=Max Payne is an Xbox Original|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/m/maxpayne2/20090424-payneoriginal.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181648/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/m/maxpayne2/20090424-payneoriginal.htm|archivedate=1 June 2009|work=Xbox.com|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also re-released in 2012 as a downloadable game in the [[PlayStation Store]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] under the PS2 classics banner, [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and in April 2016 for the [[PlayStation 4]] as a PS2 emulated downloadable game in the PlayStation Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2016/04/19/new-on-playstation-store-ratchet-clank-invisible-inc-axiom-verge/ |title=New on PlayStation Store: Ratchet &amp; Clank, Invisible Inc., Axiom Verge |last=Mead |first=Francesca |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] |date=April 19, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607125046/https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2016/04/19/new-on-playstation-store-ratchet-clank-invisible-inc-axiom-verge/ |archivedate=7 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game centers on former [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]], who attempts to solve the horrific murder of his wife and daughter, in connection to a crime case involving a designer drug named "Valkyr" and while doing so, is entangled in a larger and complex conspiracy, involving the U.S. military. It features a gritty [[neo-noir]] style and uses [[graphic novel]] panels (with [[voice-over]]s) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game, as it draws inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like [[Mickey Spillane]]. The game contains many allusions to [[Norse mythology]], particularly the myth of [[Ragnarök]], and several of the names used in the game are those of the Norse gods and mythos. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the [[Hong Kong action cinema]] genre, particularly the work of director [[John Woo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1554350.stm |title=Dark, gritty world of Max Payne |author=Hermida, Alfred |date=21 September 2001 |accessdate=12 October 2007 |publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC News]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912204349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1554350.stm |archivedate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=making&gt;[http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/the-making-max-payne?page=0%2C0 The Making of Max Payne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618015616/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/the-making-max-payne?page=0%2C0 |date=18 June 2009 }}, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', 2 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/max-payne-hard-boiled |title=Max Payne Hard Boiled |publisher=UGO.com |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215558/http://www.ugo.com/games/max-payne-hard-boiled |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was one of the first games to feature the [[bullet time]] effect popularized by ''[[The Matrix]]''.

''Max Payne'' received very positive reviews and was praised for its exciting gunplay and use of noir storytelling devices. The game won a large number of accolades,&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; including the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award.&lt;ref name="bafta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/press/maxwinsbafta.html |title=Max Payne wins prestigious BAFTA Award! |date=28 October 2001 |author=[[3D Realms]] |accessdate=23 December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110134304/http://legacy.3drealms.com/press/maxwinsbafta.html |archivedate=10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, the [[Max Payne (series)|''Max Payne'' series]] has sold over 7.5 million copies.&lt;ref name="Sales_7.5M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/37228/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_Passes_22M_Shipped_Franchise_Above_114M.php |title=''Grand Theft Auto IV'' Passes 22M Shipped, Franchise Above 114M |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=14 September 2011 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108231124/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/37228/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_Passes_22M_Shipped_Franchise_Above_114M.php |archivedate=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inspired a feature film [[Max Payne (film)|with the same title]].

==Gameplay==
''Max Payne'' is a third-person shooter in which the player assumes the role of its titular character, [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]]. Almost all the gameplay involves [[bullet time]]-based gun-fights. Levels are generally straightforward, occasionally incorporating platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game's storyline is advanced by the player following Max's [[internal monologue]] as the character determines what his next steps should be. Several of the game's levels involve Payne's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] nightmares and drug-related hallucinations.

Initially, the player's weapon is a semi-automatic pistol. As the game progresses, other weapons become accessible, including melee and hand-thrown weapons. Some weapons can be [[dual wield]]ed. Max regains health by taking [[Analgesic|painkillers]], which can be found throughout the levels. The game's [[artificial intelligence|AI]] is dependent on pre-scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is pre-scripted.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox/530725-max-payne/reviews/review-39332 |title=Max Payne Review |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |date=23 July 2001 |accessdate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428213340/http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox/530725-max-payne/reviews/review-39332 |archivedate=28 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay of ''Max Payne'' revolves around bullet time, a form of slow motion — when triggered, the passage of time is slowed down to such extent that the movements of bullets can be seen by the naked eye and enables Max to perform special moves. Although Payne's movement is also slowed, the player is still able to position the aiming reticle and react in real time, providing an advantage over enemies. Occasionally, when the last character of an enemy group is killed, the viewpoint switches to a third-person view circling a falling body. Likewise, the camera may follow the path of a bullet fired from a sniper rifle.

The "[[Dead on arrival|Dead on Arrival]]" game mode limits the player to only seven saves per chapter, and the "New York Minute" mode forces the player to complete each chapter within the allotted time, which is replenished by killing enemies. Upon completing the game on "Dead on Arrival", the player unlocks "The Last Challenge" ("End Combat" or "Final Battle" in the different versions), featuring a fight in perpetual bullet time against the "Killer Suit" hitmen.

==Plot==
[[File:May payne panels.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel panels are used in place of cutscenes as narration, an element common to neo-noir]]
The story is told ''[[in medias res]]'' and consists of three volumes: "The American Dream", "A Cold Day in Hell", and "A Bit Closer to Heaven". The game begins in January 2001, as [[New York City]] finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in its history. The intro sequence shows [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]] ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]), a renegade [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent and former [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He experiences a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from three years ago. Back in August 1998, Max returned home in New Jersey to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new [[designer drug]] called [[Valkyrie|Valkyr]]. Max rushed to aid his family, but was too late: his wife ([[Haviland Morris]]) and their newborn daughter had already been brutally murdered, much to his devastation. After their funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA.

Two and a half years later, Max is employed as an [[undercover]] operative inside the Punchinello [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family responsible for the [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet Alex Balder ([[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]]), his handler and best friend, in a subway station at Roscoe Street. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia underboss in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is killed by an unknown assassin. Payne becomes the prime suspect in Alex's murder, because he is still undercover to the media and the fact that he fled the crime scene. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and want him dead.

While searching for Lupino in businesses owned by him, Max busts a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that the [[Russian Mafia|Russian mobster]] Vladimir Lem is engaged in a fierce turf war against Punchinello's men. While searching, Max gets a phone call from a man named Alfred Woden, stating that the police have been tipped off as to his location, and he escapes. Max eventually finds Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino's right-hand man; he wounds and chases Gognitti through the city and learns the location of Lupino's hideout, a nightclub named Ragna Rock. After gunning down the insane Lupino, Payne meets [[Mona Sax]] ([[Julia Murney]]), a [[contract killing|contract assassin]], who pours him a drink which turns out to be laced with a sedative. In this state Max is found by the Mafia and is dragged away to be tortured.

Max manages to escape from the Mafia-owned slaughterhouse and enters a brief alliance with Lem. He agrees to kill one of Vladimir's traitors, Boris Dime, and his men aboard the cargo ship ''[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'' at the Brooklyn waterfront. The ship is carrying a shipment of high-powered firearms belonging to the Russian mob, which Max keeps in exchange for the favor. After surviving a bomb ambush at the Mafia restaurant Casa di Angelo, Max uses the Russian weapons to storm the residence of [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Angelo Punchinello. There he finds the body of Lisa Punchinello, Mona's sister, and discovers that the Don is only a puppet in the Valkyr market when the mafioso is killed in front of Payne by agents of Nicole Horne ([[Jane Gennaro]]), the ruthless CEO of the Aesir Corporation. Horne injects Max with an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of Valkyr and leaves him for dead, as he experiences a drug-induced nightmare and suffers internal torment from his feelings of guilt for not being able to save his family.

After surviving the overdose and awakening, Payne pursues his only lead to a steel foundry located over a hidden underground military research complex. Inside he discovers that Valkyr is the result of the Valhalla Project, an early 1990s [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] attempt to improve soldiers' stamina and morale following earlier [[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)#"The Ladder"|Ladder]] experiments; the project was sharply halted due to poor results, but was later secretly restarted by Horne through Aesir. He discovers that his wife accidentally found out about the project, and Horne let loose the crazed Valkyr test subjects into his house. Aesir initiates "Operation Dead Eyes" to get rid of evidence and witnesses, including their own scientists. Max escapes the bunker at the last moment just as it self-destructs.

Max gets a call from B.B., who arranges a meeting at an underground parking lot. At this point, Max has already figured out that it was B.B. who shot Alex and framed him for his murder. The meeting turns out to be an ambush, and a running gun-fight commences as Max chases B.B. through the garage. After killing the traitor, Max gets another phone call from Woden asking him to come to the Asgard Building. Alfred reveals himself to be part of a powerful [[secret society]] called the Inner Circle, which has strong ties to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. The Inner Circle members inform Max about Horne's identity but cannot pursue her themselves because "their hands are tied". They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping any criminal charges against him. Suddenly, Asgard is overrun by Aesir gunmen who kill everyone in the meeting room except for Max, who escapes, and Woden, who pretends to be shot. Max has to fight his way out of the building.

Max arrives at the main office of Aesir Corporation and makes his way through the high-tech security building while avoiding strafing runs by a minigun-armed helicopter. Along the way he runs into Mona again in an elevator, but Horne's men shoot her in the head after she refuses to shoot Max; her body vanishes when Max goes back to the elevator. At the top Max confronts Horne, who escapes to the roof and boards the helicopter. Max shoots the guy wires of the building's antenna, which snaps off and crashes into the helicopter, killing Horne. The game's storyline arrives at the point where it first started: the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|NYPD ESU]] arrives at the scene, arresting Max and leading him out of the Aesir building, where he sees Woden. Knowing that Woden will ensure his safe passage through the judicial system, Max smiles.

==Characters==

;Max Payne
{{main|Max Payne (character)}}
Max Payne (voiced by [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]) is a fugitive DEA agent and former NYPD [[detective]] whose wife Michelle and newborn daughter were killed in connection with the Valkyr drug case. Max then goes undercover in the mob, and eventually becomes a one-man-army [[vigilante]] waging a personal war on crime. Max ends up killing hundreds of gangsters and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] enforcers while on the run from the police determined on stopping his [[feud|vendetta]] against all those responsible for his family's death. He uses [[metaphor]]s and [[wordplay]] to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. The game presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view.

;Mona Sax
{{main|Mona Sax}}
Mona Sax (voiced by [[Julia Murney]]): The twin sister of Lisa Punchinello and a contract killer, Mona is the [[femme fatale]] of the game. She has a grudge against her sister Lisa's abusive husband, Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello, whom she desires to kill. After Punchinello is killed, she sides with Nicole Horne who hires her to kill Max. Finding herself unable to do so, she is shot in the head by Horne's henchman and collapses into an elevator.

==Development==
Remedy Entertainment developed an idea of a "third-person [[action game]]" in late 1996, after completing ''[[Death Rally]]'' (their first game), inspired first by ''[[Loaded (video game)|Loaded]]'' and then by the success of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (although determined to avoid its "horrid camera system").&lt;ref name=Apogee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rinkworks.com/apogee/s/2.8.17.shtml |title=The Apogee FAQ: Max Payne and Max Payne 2 |publisher=Rinkworks.com |date=8 November 2002 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309145011/http://www.rinkworks.com/apogee/s/2.8.17.shtml |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the game's story and script writer [[Sam Lake]], for him "the starting point was this [[archetype]] of the [[private investigator|private eye]], the hard-boiled cop" that would be used in a game with a "deeper, more psychological" story.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; A game prototype and design document of the project, with the working titles ''Dark Justice'' and ''Max Heat'' (a wordplay on this is a TV show called ''Dick Justice'' and a porn film ''Max Heat'', both featured in ''[[Max Payne 2]]''), were soon created and shown to [[3D Realms]], who signed a development deal and production began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.

[[File:Max Payne clothes.jpg|thumb|Max Payne's standard outfit on display at the [[Game On (exhibition)|Game On exhibition]] at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]]]]

For cutscenes, the developers found comic panels (with [[voice-over]]s) to be more effective and less costly to use than fully animated cinematics, noting that comic panels forced the player to interpret each panel for themselves and "the nuances are there in the head of the reader [...] it would be much harder to reach that level with in-game or even [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] cinematics."&lt;ref name=making /&gt; They also found it easier to reorganize the comic panels if the plot needed to be changed while developing the game.&lt;ref name=making /&gt; The in-game engine is used for some cutscenes involving action sequences. The music for the game was composed by [[Kärtsy Hatakka]].

Remedy used their own game engine, which they dubbed MaxFX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/3d-engine-maxfx |title=MaxFX |publisher=Mobygames.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401114744/http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/3d-engine-maxfx |archivedate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or MAX-FX, in development since early 1997). The only games that used this engine were ''Max Payne'' and its [[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|sequel]], while a MaxFX level editor was also included in the release. MAX-FX was licensed to [[Futuremark]], who used it for their ''[[3DMark]]'' [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark series]] with the last one being ''3DMark2001 Second Edition''.&lt;ref name=3dmark&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8T149k63SQ |title=3DMark 2000 HD |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430171857/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8T149k63SQ |archivedate=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14Kt1ynvic |title=3DMark 2001 - Lobby Sequence |publisher=Youtube.com |date=6 July 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902155715/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14Kt1ynvic |archivedate=2 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trailer showcasing an early version of the game's story and gameplay was shown at 1998 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], attracting great interest due to its innovative content and effects (especially the MaxFX's 3D particle-based system for smoke and muzzle flashes), although 3D Realms producers later claimed they deliberately avoided overhyping the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2003/11/max_payne_the_m.html |title=Game Matters: Max Payne: The Making of a Franchise |publisher=Dukenukem.typepad.com |date=23 November 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007040905/http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2003/11/max_payne_the_m.html |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Max Payne'' was originally scheduled to be released in the summer of 1999; however, it was repeatedly delayed and got heavily revamped in 2000. In particular, the game's graphics were improved to feature much more realistic textures and lighting, while the multiplayer mode was dropped. The game was eventually released for Windows on 23 July 2001.

As a result of the inevitable comparisons to ''The Matrix'', the designers have included several homages to the film in order to capitalize on the hype: for instance, the detonation of the subway tunnel door to gain access to the bank vault is similar to the cartwheeling elevator door in the movie, while the introduction "Nothing to Lose" level is similar to the lobby shootout scene in the film. [[Futuremark]], which licensed the MAX-FX graphics for their ''[[3DMark]]'' benchmark series, included a ''Matrix''-like lobby shootout as a game test in the 2001 edition.&lt;ref name=3dmark/&gt;

The GBA version of the game was developed in 2003 by Möbius Entertainment (later [[Rockstar Leeds]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/18/max-payne |title=Max Payne |publisher=IGN |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=26 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204101023/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/18/max-payne |archivedate=4 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/16/max-payne-developer-interview&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was developed on a far less powerful platform, this version differs greatly from the PC versions and its Xbox and PlayStation 2 ports: instead of a 3D shooter, the game is based on sprite graphics and is shown from an [[isometric projection|isometric]] perspective. However, the other gameplay features have remained very similar to the original, including the use of polygonal graphics for the characters. The story also remained the same as in PC and console versions, though some levels from the original are omitted, and the game still features many of the original's graphic novel sections, complete with some of the voice-overs.

''Max Payne'' was released to very positive reviews. [[AllGame]] praised the game's atmosphere, level and sound design while noting that the "story is, at times, predictable and full of clichés" and that "Unlike ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', where the action is integrated perfectly with its simplistic, yet appropriate story, Max Payne frequently yanks you out of the game and forces you to look at a badly-drawn in-game "graphic novel" and listen to mediocre dialogue."&lt;ref name="allgame-review" /&gt; The review also noted a lack of replay value or multiplayer modes.&lt;ref name="allgame-review" /&gt;

The game won many annual awards for the year 2001, including Best PC Game by the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]; [[Golden Joystick Award]] by [[Dennis Publishing]]; Visitors Award Best PC Game at the [[European Computer Trade Show]]; Best Game of 2001, Best Graphics in a PC Game, and Best PC Action Game by ''[[The Electric Playground]]''; Readers Choice Best Game and Best PC Game by ''[[Pelit]]''; Computer Game of the Year by ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]''; Best PC Game of 2001 by [[Amazon.com]]; PC Game of the Year by [[Shacknews]] and by GameZone; The Best of 2001 - PC and Editor's Choice by [[Game Revolution]]; Reader's Choice Game, Best Single Player Action Game, and Best Xbox Game by [[GameSpot]]; Readers' Choice Game of the Year, Best Storyline, Best Graphics and Best of Use of Sound, and Best Adventure Game (Xbox) and Editor's Choice by [[IGN]]; Gamers Choice Award (Xbox) by [[Games Domain]]; Best Gimmick by [[GameSpy]] (runner-up in the Best Ingame Cinematics and Best Movie Trailer categories); and Editor's Choice and Best Innovation Destined for Overuse by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/max/awards.html |title=Max Payne Game Awards |publisher=3D Realms |date= |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141110114221/http://legacy.3drealms.com/max/awards.html |archivedate=10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of IGN wrote: "This game garnered so many votes from the readers that we almost decided to create a new Best Max Payne Game of 2001 category."&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; The site also called it the 96th best PlayStation 2 game.

Common criticism usually centered on ''Max Payne''{{'}}s lack of replay value, as there is no multiplayer mode, and the linear story mode due to the level design and pre-scripted enemy behavior that provides 10–15 hours of gameplay.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; While the graphics were generally praised for high-resolution textures, the character models lacked animated facial expressions (IGN criticized the titular character's "grimace on his face that makes him look constipated").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/161/161645p1.html |title=Max Payne - PC Review at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516102235/http://pc.ign.com/articles/161/161645p1.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayStation 2 version suffered from reduced detail and occasional slowdowns, as the game stressed the limits of the console's power. In addition, the levels were broken up into smaller parts so it would not tax the PlayStation 2's 32 MB of RAM, which according to IGN caused "heavy disruption to the flow and tension of the story". Otherwise it was a faithful port that retained all of the content from the PC original.

The finished game received several Game of the Month-type awards in various video game outlets (and a Seal of Excellence at Adrenaline Vault), and was included in the 2005 list of 50 best games of all time, as well as in the 2011 list of 100 top PC games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/02/16/the-100-best-pc-games-of-all-time/ |title=The 100 best PC games of all time |publisher=PC Gamer |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917071121/http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/02/16/the-100-best-pc-games-of-all-time/ |archivedate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[bit-tech]] included the game and its sequel on the list of the top five most [[Mod (computer gaming)|moddable]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Thomas |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2007/06/12/top_5_moddable_games/1 |title=Feature - The Top 5 Most Moddable Games &amp;#124; bit-gamer.net |website=Bit-tech.net |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911193900/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2007/06/12/top_5_moddable_games/1 |archivedate=11 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It received two awards from [[Eurogamer]], Best Game Cinematography Award and Best Game Character Award of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/max/awards.html |title=3D Realms Max Payne Game Awards |publisher=3drealms.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141110114221/http://legacy.3drealms.com/max/awards.html |archivedate=10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micropolix''' is a privately held Spanish [[family entertainment center]] company currently operating in San Sebastian de los Reyes, [[Madrid]], allowing children to work in adult jobs and earn currency. Micropolix has received more than 2.5 million guests since its opening, making it the most well known  [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]] brand in Spain.

==Overview==
Every Micropolix is themed as a child-sized replica of a real city, including buildings, shops and theaters, as well as vehicles and [[pedestrian]]s moving along its streets. In this city, children aged 4 through 16, work in branded activities from retail El Corte Ingles{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}, investigating in a I+D*i food lab Pascual{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} or even learning how to be a responsible driver at [[Renault]] circuit. More than 40 different activities counting on one hundred roles. The children earn Eurix (Micropolix’s currency) while performing the tasks, and the money is kept in the Micropolix bank for children to spend on the activities.&lt;ref name=Openn-profile&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b03MmLTDsfo |title=A Little City for Little People|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Pierce the Ploughmans Crede.JPG|thumb|right|270px|The frontispiece of Reyner Wolfe's edition of ''Pierce the Ploughman's Crede'', printed in 1553]]
'''''Pierce the Ploughman's Crede''''' is a medieval [[alliterative]] poem of 855 lines, lampooning the four orders of [[friars]].

==Textual history==
Surviving in two complete 14th-century manuscripts and two early printed editions,&lt;ref&gt;British Library MS Bibl. Reg.18.B.17 and MS Trinity College Cambridge R.3.15&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Crede'' can be dated on internal evidence to the short period between 1393 and 1400. The two manuscripts both include ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', and in the first, the ''Crede'' serves as an introduction to a C-text version of ''Piers Plowman''. Additionally, BL MS Harley 78 contains a fragment of the ''Crede'' copied c. 1460–70.&lt;ref&gt;MS Harley is a collection made by [[John Stow]] in the 16th century; it contains poems by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]], and [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Crede'' was first printed in London by [[Reyner Wolfe]],&lt;ref&gt;1553 (STC 19904)&lt;/ref&gt; and then reprinted for inclusion with Owen Rogers's 1561 reprint of [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]]'s 1550 edition of ''Piers Plowman''.&lt;ref&gt;STC 19908&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crede'' was not printed again until [[Thomas Bensley]]'s edition in 1814, based on that of 1553, and Thomas Wright's of 1832.&lt;ref&gt;1832, rerrinted 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The 1553 and 1561 editions were altered to include more anticlericalism and to attack an "[[abbot]]" where the original text had "bishop". This latter revision is a conservative one, undoubtedly motivated by the security of attacking a defunct institution following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] rather than an aspect of Catholicism which survived in the [[Church of England]]. Nearly all modern critics have agreed that several lines about [[transubstantiation]] were removed. This excision was covered with a (perhaps interpolated) passage not found in any of the manuscripts.

The poem exists in several modern editions: Thomas Wright and Walter Skeat produced independent versions in the 19th century; more recently, James Dean has edited the text for TEAMs, and Helen Barr has produced an annotated edition in ''The Piers Plowman Tradition'' (London: J.M. Dent, 1993) ({{ISBN|0-460-87050-5}}).

==Authorship==
Some scholars believe it is very likely that the author of the ''Crede'' may also be responsible for the anti-fraternal ''[[The Plowman's Tale|Plowman's Tale]]'', also known as the ''Complaint of the Ploughman''. Both texts were probably composed at about the same time, with ''The Plowman's Tale'' being the later and drawing extensively on the ''Crede''. The author/speaker of ''The Plowman's Tale'' mentions that he will not deal with friars, since he has already dealt with them "before, / In a makynge of a 'Crede'..." [[W. W. Skeat]] believed that ''The Plowman's Tale'' and the ''Crede'' were definitely by the same person, although they differ in style. Others reject this thesis, suggesting that the author of ''The Plowman's Tale'' makes the extra-textual reference to a creed to enhance his own authority.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ''Crede'' was usually attributed to Chaucer. The editor of the 1606 edition of ''The Plowman's Tale'', possibly [[Anthony Wotton]], explains his speculations with this [[Gloss (margin text)|gloss]]: "A Creede: Some thinke hee means the questions of [[Jack Upland|Jack-vpland]], or perhaps Pierce Ploughmans Creede. For [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] speakes this in the person of the Pellican, not in his owne person." This statement is ambivalent, suggesting that Chaucer could fictionally ("in the person of the Pellican") claim authorship for another text that he may not have actually written (i.e., the ''Crede''), or Chaucer might be referring to one of his own writings (i.e., ''Jack Upland''). Since ''Jack Upland'' was definitely (and wrongly) attributed to Chaucer in the 16th century, it is likely that the editor is introducing the possibility of a fictive authorship claim to deal with the possibility that ''The Plowman's Tale'' refers to the ''Crede''. In this way the editor may have thought that if ''Jack Upland'' is signified by the "crede" reference in ''The Plowman's Tale'', then "Chaucer" is speaking; if the ''Crede'' is signified, then it is the "Pellican, not [Chaucer's] own person."

The ''Crede'' might also have been attributed to "Robert Langland" (i.e., [[William Langland]]) because of its inclusion in the 1561 edition of ''Piers Plowman'', although this edition dropped the preface by [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] that names Langland. One reader of the 1561 ''Piers Plowman'' (which appends the ''Crede'') made notes (dated 1577) in his copy that quote [[John Bale]]'s attribution of ''Piers Plowman'' to Langland ("ex primis J. Wiclevi discipulis unum") in Bale's ''Index...Scriptorum''. Because of differences in language and his belief that Chaucer lived later than Langland, the reader concludes that the ''Crede'' alone (and not ''Piers Plowman'') is Chaucer's.

==Significant contents==
Like much political or religious poetry of the [[Alliterative Revival]] (i.e., ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''[[Mum and the Sothsegger]]''), the poem takes the form of a quest for knowledge. It is narrated by a layman who has memorised nearly all of the rudimentary texts demanded by the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. He can read, and is able to recite the [[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]] and [[Pater Noster]] proficiently: yet he does not know the [[Creed]]. He seeks help from the friars, first turning to the [[Franciscans]], then the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], followed by the [[Augustinians|Austin friars]] and the [[Carmelites]]. But rather than learning anything of value, all he hears are imprecations. Each order savagely attacks one of its rival groups of mendicants: the Franciscans denounce the Carmelites; the Carmelites denounce the Dominicans; the Dominicans denounce the Augustines; the Augustines complete this carousel of invective by denouncing the Franciscans. The entire poem seems like an uproarious inversion of cantos xi and xii of [[Dante]]'s ''Paradiso'': just as Dante has the Dominican [[Aquinas]] and the Franciscan [[Bonaventure]] lauding one another's orders, so the ''Crede''-poet makes the mendicants exchange abuse.

But all is not entirely lost. As he returns home, the narrator encounters a poor Plowman, dressed in rags and so emaciated that ''men myyte reken ich a ryb'' (432). Although starving, the Plowman freely offers the narrator what food he does have. When the narrator tells him of his experiences with the friars, the Plowman launches into a blistering diatribe on the four orders. Recognising the wisdom of the Plowman's words, the narrator asks him whether he can teach him the Creed. He is glad to do so: the poem ends with the Plowman's recital of the elusive text.

Two features make the ''Crede'' particularly worthy of note. Firstly, it is the earliest text to imitate [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', to which it refers explicitly. The selfless Plowman is of course directly drawn from the earlier work. Perhaps written within eight years of the C-text of ''Piers Plowman'', the ''Crede'' thus testifies to the appeal of Langland's more subversive, anticlerical sentiments among some of his early readers. Of course, the ''Crede''-poet only uses ''Piers Plowman'' as a launch-pad for his own views. The ''Crede'' is markedly more confident than Langland in its opposition to the clergy. The fact that it abandons Langland's dream-vision framework is suggestive of this, as if the lay perfection that the Plowman represents has become more achievable in reality. ''The Crede'' conflates Piers (here, "Peres") with the author/dreamer of ''Piers Plowman'', thus collapsing that poem's many voices into a single, collective voice of the ideal community. This misprision was a common aspect of Piers Plowman's dissemination. The character of Piers thus escapes from the confines of [[William Langland]]'s vision and takes on a life, an authority, and an authorial career of his own. As in ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'' and ''The Prayer and Complaint of the Plowman'', true religion is the virtue of the poor. The Piers of the ''Crede'' is simply a plowman without the Christological aspect of Piers in Langland's poem.

A second, related point of interest is that the ''Crede'' is a [[Lollard]] production that acknowledges the influence of [[Walter Map]]'s Latin, anti-monastic "Goliardic" satires, such as "[[Apocalypse of Golias|The Apocalypse of Bishop Golias]]" and "The Confession of Golias." The author of the ''Crede'' claims that these works tarnished the monastic orders and brought on the [[mendicant orders]], or else Satan himself founded them. With clear [[Lollard]] sympathies, the ''Crede'' praises [[John Wycliffe]] and as well as [[Walter Brut]] who is mentioned in relation to his heresy trial. (There were several trials for Brut, a Welsh Lollard, from 1391–1393.)

The ''Crede'''s content wholly conforms to Lollard views of the friars. Most of the charges against the friars are familiar from other works such as ''[[Jack Upland]]'', the ''Vae Octuplex'' or Wyclif's ''Trialogus'', and most are ultimately derived from [[William of Saint-Amour]]'s ''De Periculis Novissimorum Temporum'' (1256). As in all Wycliffite satire, the friars are lecherous, covetous, greedy, vengeful, demanding extravagant donations for even the most elementary services. They seek out only the fattest corpses to bury, and live in ostentatious houses that are more like palaces than places of worship. They are the children of [[Lucifer]] rather than [[Saint Dominic]] or [[Francis of Assisi|St Francis]], and follow in the footsteps of [[Cain]], the first treacherous ''frater''. But the fact that the poem's main approach is dramatic rather than didactic or polemic, and its frequent passages of striking physical description, elevate it beyond the vast bulk of antifraternal writing. [[Elizabeth Salter]]'s charge of empty 'sensationalism' seems highly unjust.{{according to whom|date=September 2013}} The poem's vicious and unremitting attacks are impressively constructed, and even entertaining in their lacerating cynicism. Plus, as von Nolcken and Barr have shown, there is a remarkable subtlety to the poem, as it draws on even the most purely philosophical aspects of Wyclif's system. The opposition between the friars and Piers is finely crafted. While the friars squabble and bicker with one another, the true (i.e., Lollard) Christians form a single unity; at the end of the poem, in the words of Barr, 'the voices of Peres, narrator and poet all merge' into a single 'I':

{| class="toccolours"
| &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''all þat euer I haue seyd soþ it me semeþ'',/
''And all þat euer I haue written is soþ, as I trowe'',/
''And for amending of þise men is most þat I write''
--(836-8).
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|}

'''Q WORKSHOP''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] company located in [[Poznań]] that specializes in design
and production of [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[dice]] and dice accessories for use in various games ([[role-playing game]]s,
[[board game]]s and tabletop [[wargaming|wargame]]s). They also run an [[Online shop|online retail store]] and maintain
an active [[social media]] community.

Q WORKSHOP was established in 2001 by Patryk Strzelewicz. Initially,
the company sold its products via online [[auction]] services, but in 2005 a website and online store were also
established. Currently there are over 120 designs of dice in stock.

The Q WORKSHOP dice are known for their distinct style and engravings, featuring various motifs such as :
Elven, Dragon, Runic. In 2007 Q WORKSHOP begun production of licensed dice sets, starting with
[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]] dice set on license from [[Chaosium|Chaosium Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=Staff |title=Official Call of Cthulhu Dice from Q-Workshop |url=http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=398 |publisher=Yog-sothoth.com |date=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2008-04-29}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following up in 2008 with

Since then, the company has cooperated with companies like [[Knight Models]], [[Monte Cook Games]] or [[Catalyst Game Labs]], to create even more unusual dice designs.

The company offers a custom dice service allowing its clients to design and produce their own unique dice designs, which may then be added to the Q WORKSHOP public catalog.

In 2007 Patryk Strzelewicz was nominated to [[Entrepreneur of the Year Award]] hosted by [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in the "New Business Category" for his involvement with Q WORKSHOP,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=Staff |title=Dariusz Miłek is named the Entrepreneur of the Year 2007 |url=http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/Poland_E/Media_-_28_11_07_-_EOY2007?OpenDocument&amp;Click= |publisher=Ernst &amp; Young |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2008-04-29 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roller derby''' is a [[contact sport]] played by two teams of five members [[roller skating]] counter-clockwise around a track. Roller derby is played by approximately 1,250 [[amateur]] leagues worldwide, mostly inside the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moffett |first=Matt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324610504578278171721339976?fb_action_ids=10152543496805385&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582 |title=As the World Turns, So Do the Wheels of Roller Derby |website=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-02-03|accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting their own jammer—in effect, playing both [[offense (sports)|offense]] and [[defense (sports)|defense]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnFddETifY8 |title=Common Ground: the alternative sport of roller derby |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930s, [[Leo Seltzer]] and [[Damon Runyon]] are credited with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of [[sports entertainment]], where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D01D520xcws |title=Roller Derby: The Fastest Growing Sport In America |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Rick (24 June 2008).

Modern roller derby is an international sport, mostly played by amateurs. Most teams are all-female teams, but there is a growing number of male, unisex, and [[junior roller derby]] teams. It was under consideration as a [[roller sport]] for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/07/04/will-roller-derby-be-included-in-the-2020-olympics/ |title=Will roller derby be included in the 2020 Olympics? &amp;#124; Olympics &amp;#124; Sports &amp;#124; National Post |website=Sports.nationalpost.com |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720053434/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/07/04/will-roller-derby-be-included-in-the-2020-olympics/ |archive-date=20 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympictalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/28/roller-sports-pitch-for-the-2020-olympics/|title=Roller Sports’s pitch for the 2020 Olympics|date=2013-05-28|website=Olympictalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/30/three-sports-make-olympic-cut-for-2020-summer-games |title=Three Sports Make Olympic Cut for 2020 Summer Games |author=Greg Otto|publisher=U.S. News|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2017-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815102732/https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/30/three-sports-make-olympic-cut-for-2020-summer-games |archivedate=2017-08-15}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports|FIRS]], recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] as the official international governing body of roller sports, released its first set of Roller Derby Rules for the World Roller Games that took place September 2017 in Nanjing, China.

Contemporary roller derby has a basic set of rules, with variations reflecting the interests of a [[#Associations and governing bodies|governing body]]'s  member leagues. The summary below is based on the rules of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).&lt;ref name="WFTDARules"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rules of Flat Track Roller Derby|url=https://rules.wftda.com/|publisher=Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA)|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, [[Derby News Network]] claimed that more than 98% of roller derby competitions were conducted under WFTDA rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/2010/03/dnn_releases_first_power_rankings_2010|title=DNN Releases First Power Rankings of 2010|publisher=Derby News Network|date=2010-03-05|accessdate=2011-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201041743/http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/2010/03/dnn_releases_first_power_rankings_2010|archive-date=2011-12-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, members of the [[United Kingdom Roller Derby Association]] are required to play by WFTDA rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrda.org.uk/?page_id=12|title=Join Us|publisher=United Kingdom Roller Derby Association|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while members of the former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association were encouraged to join the WFTDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwrda.ca/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510105027/http://www.cwrda.ca/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-05-10|title=Welcome to CWRDA|publisher=Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association|accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Two teams of up to 15 players each field up to five members for episodes called "jams." Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the "jammer"); the other four members are "blockers." One blocker can be designated as a "pivot"—a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

During each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another "trip" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any member of the opposing team.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The rules describe an "earned" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that opponent and a point for each opponent not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack and the opposing jammer too, it is a five-point scoring trip, commonly called a "grand slam."

Each team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.

===Jams===
[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]
Play begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the "jammer line" and the "pivot line" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|12}} Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.

[[File:Texas Roller Derby Lonestar Rollergirls.jpg|thumb|Lonestar Rollergirls in Austin, Texas, play on a banked track. The jammer (wearing the starred helmet cover) is trying to pass a pivot (wearing a striped cover) with various blockers assisting.]]
The pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of  it, an area known as the "engagement zone."&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

The first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of "lead jammer."&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}} A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.

===Blocking===
[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]
A skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Penalties===
[[File:Roller derby, Amsterdam Derby Dames against the Ruhr Pott Roller Girls from Essen, Germany.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A German pivot attempts to knock a Dutch jammer out of bounds (the yellow line) at a 2011 bout held in [[Essen, Germany]].]]
Referees penalize rules violations.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|36}} A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a [[penalty box]] for 30 seconds of jam time.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|29}} If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|30}} The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in [[ice hockey]].

However, the "power jam", derived from hockey's [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|"power play"]], does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://svrollergirls.wordpress.com/roller-derby-a-glossary/|title=Roller derby: A glossary|publisher=Silicon Valley Roller Girls|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, that team cannot score.  While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.

It would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|31}} A player "fouls out" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|32}}

===Equipment===
Players skate on four-wheeled ("quad") roller skates,&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

==Strategy and tactics==
Offense and defense are played simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&amp;nav}}&lt;/ref&gt; a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics. For example, blockers may create a large hole for their jammer to pass through and score, but this same maneuver might also allow the opposing team's jammer to score.&lt;ref name="vodoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vodoo|first=Big Daddy|title=Roller Derby Strategies and Plays|url=http://bigarmy.net/index.php?topic=74.0|publisher=Little City Roller Girs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&amp;pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strategy|Strategies]] (high-level plans toward achieving the game's goal, which is to outscore the opposition) include the following:
*'''Ending the jam''': The lead jammer can "call off" or end the jam at any time, controlling the opposition's ability to score points. The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.
*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may "pass the star" (may perform a "star pass") to the pivot—that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position – Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as "passing the panty", as helmet covers are sometimes known as "panties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.&lt;ref name="LearnPivot" /&gt;

[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:
*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a "wide stance" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt; The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:
**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.
**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.
[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]
*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:
**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.
**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.
**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.
**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360°) to end up forward of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming – Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].
**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&amp;pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.
*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} In the "goat-herding" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team, and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.
*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.&lt;ref name=western-style&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officials==
WFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|35}} and many non-skating officials (NSOs). Referees skate on the inside of the track; in flat-track derby, some also skate on the outside of the track. They call penalties, award points, and ensure safe game play.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|36}} Referees must wear skates and typically wear white and black stripes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|38}} NSOs take up a range of positions inside and outside the track, start and time the jams, record and display scores and penalties communicated by referees, record the number of each skater on track for a given jam, and time and record skaters in the penalty box. Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.

===Television===
On November 29, 1948, before television viewership was widespread, ''Roller Derby'' debuted on New York [[television]].&lt;ref name=dedford /&gt;{{rp|89}} The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches.&lt;ref name="rushin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014779/index.htm |title=A Forward Roll: Dusted off and spiffed up, the Roller Derby is aiming to regain the hold it once had on TV |date=1998-12-14 |periodical=Sports Illustrated |last1=Rushin |first1=Steve |author-link=Steve Rushin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908040817/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014779/index.htm |archive-date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2018-04-24 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1949–1950 season, Seltzer formed the [[National Roller Derby League]] (NRDL), comprising six teams.&lt;ref name="KTVU"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dedford /&gt;{{rp|95}} NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week.&lt;ref name="KTVU" /&gt; During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. [[Jerry Seltzer]] (Leo's son), the ''Roller Derby'' "commissioner", hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base. He adapted the sport for television by developing scripted story lines and rules designed to improve television appeal, but derby's popularity declined.&lt;ref name=dedford&gt;{{cite book|last=Deford|first=Frank|title=Five Strides on the Banked Track: The Life and Times of the Roller Derby|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1971|isbn=0-316-17920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1989 saw the debut of ''[[RollerGames]],'' an even more theatrical variant of roller derby for national audiences. It used a figure-8 track and rules adapted for this track. Bill Griffiths, Sr. served as commissioner while his son, Bill Griffiths, Jr., managed the L.A. T-Birds, who (according to the storyline) were seeking revenge on the Violators (led by Skull) for cheating in the Commissioner's Cup. The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez). It ran one season, because some of its syndicators went bankrupt.

In 1999, [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] (now [[Spike TV]]) debuted ''[[RollerJam]],'' which used the classic rules and banked oval track, but allowed inline skates (although some skaters wore traditional quad skates). Jerry Seltzer was commissioner for this version.

Most players in roller leagues skate under pseudonyms, also called "[[derby name]]s" or "skater names." These typically use [[word play]] with satirical, mock-violent or sexual [[pun]]s, [[alliteration]], and allusions to [[popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Referees#Roller derby|Referees]] use derby names as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/blogs/justice_feelgood_marshall/2008/12/killbox_retires_sort|title=Killbox retires (sort of)|publisher=[[Derby News Network]]|author=Tracy "Justice Feelgood Marshall" Williams|date=2008-12-08|accessdate=2008-12-30|journal=&amp;mdash;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225211439/http://derbynewsnetwork.com/blogs/justice_feelgood_marshall/2008/12/killbox_retires_sort|archive-date=2010-12-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often shown on the backs of their striped uniforms. Some players claim their names represent [[alter ego]]s that they adopt while skating.&lt;ref name="derby brats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleschild.com/article/seattle-derby-brats-no-flash-in-the-pan1|title=Seattle Derby Brats – No Flash in the Pan|accessdate=2010-08-23|quote=It's like your alter ego," Grianne says, "You don't want to be announced as Grianne Hunter.

Whether a team should skate under real names or derby names is sometimes debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverrollerdolls.org/index.php/teams/mile-high-club/|title=Denver Roller Dolls—Teams—Mile High Club|accessdate=2009-07-19|quote=This season, 13 of the team's members are making the switch from derby names to real names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some derby names are obscene, and this attracts controversy among other skaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbylife.com/articles/2011/09/derby_names_not_ready_prime_time |title=Derby Names: Not Ready for Prime Time |website=DerbyLife.com |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copying of derby names has attracted legal and sociological analysis as an example of indigenous development of property rights.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt; New players are encouraged to check derby names against an international roster to ensure they are not already in use.&lt;ref name=twoevils1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://derbyrollcall.com Derby Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821140439/http://www.derbyrollcall.com/ |date=2018-08-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of roller derby events are also sardonic and convoluted—for example, Night of the Rolling Dead ([[Night of the Living Dead]]), Knocktoberfest ([[Oktoberfest]]), Spanksgiving ([[Thanksgiving]]), Seasons Beatings ([[Christmas and holiday season|Seasons Greetings]]), Grandma Got Run Over By a Rollergirl ([[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]), Cinco de May-hem ([[Cinco de Mayo]]), and War of the Wheels ([[The War of the Worlds|War of the Worlds]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasurevalleyrollergirls.net/news.html |title=Treasure Valley Rollergirls |publisher=Treasure Valley Rollergirls |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724112536/http://www.treasurevalleyrollergirls.net/news.html |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficial injuries include torn eyelashes and "fishnet burn", a stippled effect of falling while wearing fishnet hose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Roller Derby Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc.|last=Wilson|first=Tracy|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/roller-derby6.htm|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, torn ligaments, broken bones, and [[concussion]]s also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Some leagues prominently display their injuries, to embellish the image of violence or [[machismo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ratcityrollergirls.com/injuries.html |title=Injury Gallery |publisher=Rat City Rollergirls |accessdate=2008-06-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026040642/http://www.ratcityrollergirls.com/injuries.html |archivedate=2007-10-26|deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.mnrollergirls.com/photos/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113205/http://www.mnrollergirls.com/photos/index_SIMPLE.php?album=Pabst_Bruise_Gallery |archivedate=2007-08-14 |title=Pabst Bruise Gallery |publisher=Minnesota RollerGirls |accessdate=2008-06-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some skaters say the sport is reasonably safe if skaters take precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules require appropriate medical professionals on-site at every bout,&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|39}} even if not required by laws or arena regulations. The WFTDA offers insurance for leagues in the United States with legal liability and accident coverage, but it recommends that skaters also carry their own primary medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wftda.org/resources/insurance|title=WFTDA Insurance Program|publisher=WFTDA|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
Although the early 2000s revival of roller derby was initially all-female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams and unisex games; {{as of|2013|05|lc=yes}} there were over 140 [[junior roller derby]] programs in the United States, and many more around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyroster.com/index.php|title=Roller Derby Worldwide|access-date=2013-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111173106/http://www.derbyroster.com/index.php|archive-date=2013-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller derby bouts are now [[Streaming media|streamed]] online, and there is archived video of past bouts and tournaments. The WFTDA offers live streaming video of its tournaments at &lt;code&gt;wftda.tv&lt;/code&gt;. [[Derby News Network]] (&lt;code&gt;www.DerbyNewsNetwork.com&lt;/code&gt;) offered live streaming video and archived video including events outside the WFTDA.

FiveOnFive magazine covers roller derby and diverse aspects such as business, training, junior roller derby, and nutrition.&lt;ref name="FiveOnFive Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveonfivemag.com/|title=fiveonfive » women’s flat track roller derby magazine|website=Fiveonfivemag.com|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and organization==
{{Main article|List of roller derby associations}} 
The largest governing body for the sport is the [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] (WFTDA), with 397 full member leagues and 48 apprentice leagues.&lt;ref name="WFTDA Member Leagues"&gt;{{Cite web |title=WFTDA Leagues |publisher=WFTDA |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-08 |url=https://wftda.com/wftda-leagues/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFTDA membership is a major goal of aspiring leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

USA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. WFTDA and USARS maintain a reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes.&lt;ref name=reciprocity-agreement&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usarollersports.org/roller-derby/usars-wftda-reciprocity|accessdate=2011-10-12|publisher=USA Roller Sports |date=2009-06-24 |title=USARS / WFTDA Reciprocity |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006141048/http://usarollersports.org/roller-derby/usars-wftda-reciprocity|archivedate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the [[United States]], many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations, such as [[Skate Australia]],&lt;ref name=skate-australia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skateaustralia.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=273 |title=Ballarat Junior Roller Derby Star Set for Battle |author=Rachel Afflick |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007142434/http://www.skateaustralia.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=273 |archivedate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Roller Sports Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roller Derby is now recognised as a sport in the UK, and UKRDA the National Association|url=http://www.euroderby.org/news/125-roller-derby-is-now-recognised-as-a-sport-in-the-uk-and-ukrda-the-national-association|website=Euroderby.org|accessdate=2011-10-02}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roller Sports Canada]].&lt;ref name=skate-Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollersports.ca/roller-derby/|title=Roller Derby|date=2010-01-07 |website=Rollersports.ca|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, roller derby was recognized as a sport in Paris in 2010 by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), which reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017, FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. Teams competed under the FIRS rules at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China.&lt;ref name="rollersports.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersports.org/|title=Rolling Up to Tokio 2020|website=Rollersports.org|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.&lt;ref name=rdaf-can&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Roller Derby Association of Canada |accessdate=2011-10-12 |title=Welcome to the CWRDA |url=http://www.cwrda.ca/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026035120/http://www.cwrda.ca/ |archivedate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tournaments===
Since 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008, it took the current [[WFTDA Championship|"Big 5"]] format: four regional playoffs and a final championship tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE BIG 5 WFTDA SPONSORED TOURNAMENTS |url=http://wftda.com/The-Big-5 |publisher=WFTDA |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115205158/http://wftda.com/The-Big-5|archivedate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFTDA also recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WFTDA Recognized Events|url= http://wftda.com/events|publisher=WFTDA|accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the first [[Roller Derby World Cup]] took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood &amp; Thunder Roller Derby World Cup 2011|url=http://bloodandthundermag.com/WorldCup2011.htm|publisher=Blood &amp; Thunder Magazine|accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014 Roller Derby World Cup|second World Cup]] took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas to Host 2014 Roller Derby World Cup|url=http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/2013/06/10/dallas-to-host-2014-roller-derby-world-cup/|publisher=Blood &amp; Thunder Magazine|date=2013-06-10|accessdate=2014-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214162640/http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/2013/06/10/dallas-to-host-2014-roller-derby-world-cup/|archive-date=2014-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017, FIRS and the USOC recognized USARS to participate in the Nanjing games.&lt;ref name="rollersports.org"/&gt;

==Social significance==
Zaina Arafat asserts in ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' that roller derby defies [[heteronormativity]] and patriarchal standards. In [[Egypt]], Arafat says, there are expectations that a woman will not show visible scars, will have an unblemished body for her husband, and will refrain from activities that may damage her body. She says roller derby in Egypt is subversive, as it acts as an indirect political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Arafat, Zaina, "POWER JAM: Roller Derby as Political Act", ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]],'' vol. 93, no. 3, Summer2017, pp. 36-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carly Giesler states that skaters enact sexualities that create or reclaim an identity, and their role parodies "hegemonic scripts of sexuality" through the use of costumes, derby names and personas. Roller derby acts as a unique stage for female athletes, letting them rebut constraints society places on women and female athletes. Giesler argues that female sports objectifies them for the [[Male gaze|male gaze]], but roller derby turns this on its head by disregarding gender roles and norms.&lt;ref name="gieseler"&gt;Gieseler, Carly. “Derby Drag: Parodying Sexualities in the Sport of Roller Derby.” Sexualities, vol. 17, no. 5-6, 2014, pp. 758–776., doi:10.1177/1363460714531268.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Sgt. Frog'''''|ケロロ軍曹|Keroro Gunsō|lit. "Sergeant Keroro"}} is a [[manga]] series by [[Mine Yoshizaki]]. It was later adapted into an [[anime]] television series directed by [[Junichi Sato]]. Both the anime and manga are comedies that follow the attempts of a platoon of frog-like alien invaders to conquer Earth. Sergeant Keroro, the titular character, is the leader of the platoon, but is at the mercy of a human family of three after he is captured while trying to hide in one of the family member's bedrooms. In both the manga and anime, Keroro is forced to do meaningless chores and errands for the family after his army abandons his platoon on Earth. The platoon has many failed attempts at taking over Earth.

The series takes its comedy from a combination of wordplay (particularly puns and homophones), physical humor, situational irony, breaking of the [[fourth wall]], and numerous pop culture references (especially to ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'', ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and many others, although when broadcast and published in the United States, they make references that American audiences would be familiar with like ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black]]'').&lt;ref&gt;The aforementioned ''Gundam'' nods appear often, which comes easy since both series are produced by renowned studio Sunrise. Yet that does not stop the show from humorously referencing other anime like ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'' and ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. U.S. publisher Funimation takes it a step further in the English dub with a barrage of pop culture nods from ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' to ''[[Robotech]]'' to ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''." http://blogs.starbulletin.com/otakuohana/?p=474 ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Various anime, games, manga, and other aspects of pop culture are parodied/referenced throughout the series as a bonus to older viewers. Both the manga and the anime are laden with pop-culture references, and even in the same story the references often vary wildly. The anime does not explicitly refer to Evangelion or other animations to which Bandai does not hold the copyrights, but only recreates the "feel" of famous scenes from these anime. The anime is much more detailed and direct in its Gundam references, however, since its animation studio, Sunrise, is a subsidiary of Bandai who does hold the rights to the Gundam franchise. 

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Sgt. Frog characters}}

The main plot of the story focuses on the steadily deteriorating conditions of the Keroro Platoon, a group of five, frog-like aliens from Planet Keron of the Gamma Planetary System. The platoon’s mission is to invade and conquer Earth (known to the aliens as “Pekopon”), but fail miserably at each attempt. Sergeant Keroro (or Keroro Gunso) although being the leader of the platoon, is childish, incompetent, and would rather spend his time indulging in his hobby of making plastic [[Gundam models]] than take over Earth. Aside from Keroro, there are four other members of the Keroro Platoon: adorable but violent Private Second Class Tamama; bellicose yet tenderhearted Coporal Giroro; intelligent but mischievous Sergeant Major Kururu; and disciplined but traumatized Lance Corporal Dororo.

The largest obstacle in the way of their mission is the Hinata Family, who must take care of the Keroro Platoon due to the Keron Army deserting the latter on Earth. Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro's human is Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro's human is Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the Sergeant his only true friend; Kululu's human is Mutsumi Saburo, who discovered him; Dororo's human is Koyuki, a fellow ninja; and Tamama's human is his equal in bipolar insanity, Momoka Nishizawa. All are tied to the Hinatas in some way throughout the events in the anime and manga.

==Media==

===Manga===

''Sgt. Frog'' is published in Japan by [[Kadokawa Shoten]], serialized in the magazine ''[[Shōnen Ace]]'', and was published in English by [[Tokyopop]]. The manga began its monthly run in the weekly shōnen magazine, ''Shōnen Ace''. The manga, first aimed at the older audience (teens/adults) from the first to the seventh volume, was toned down after the anime adaption started (since the TV series was a family show). However, the manga still maintains suggestive comedy that only the more mature audiences understand in present volumes. [[Tokyopop]] initially held the American rights to the ''Sgt. Frog'' manga until 2011 when the company ceased operations. By the time their publication ended, they had published 21 volumes. Their release of the manga have censored nipples drawn in some scenes, in order to get away from the OT (Older teen) rating and maintaining its Teen rating.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Viz Media]] relicensed the manga for digital release on December 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-12-16/viz-media-adds-mikansei-no-1-sgt-frog-hands-off-digitally/.82256|title=Viz Media Adds Mikansei No. 1, Sgt.

===Anime===
{{Main article|List of Sgt. Frog episodes}}''
{{Cleanup|reason=This section was combined to include English release info, fixes are needed that may include duplicate information and copyedit issues.|date=May 2015}}

The anime series started airing on [[TV Tokyo]] in 2004 and ended in 2011. The anime is produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], and has been aired on [[Animax]], [[TV Tokyo]], and [[TX Network|TXN]]. Seven seasons have been created during its seven-year run. Unlike the manga which is aimed at older audiences, the anime adaptation has been toned down to a level suitable for family audiences. [[A.D. Vision|ADV]] had previously announced they had acquired exclusive rights to an English dub of ''Sgt. Frog''&lt;ref name="AVI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-11-20/adv-acquires-sgt-frog|title=ADV Acquires SGT. Frog|date=November 20, 2006|publisher=AnimeNewsNetwork|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for $408,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles | title= ADV Court Documents Reveal Amounts Paid for 29 Anime Titles| website=AnimeNewsNetwork.com | date= 30 January 2012 | accessdate= 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, on July 4, 2008, it was announced that rights to the English release were transferred to [[Funimation Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Funimation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-04/funimation-picks-up-over-30-former-ad-vision-titles|title=Funimation Picks Up Over 30 Former AD Vision Titles|date=July 4, 2008|publisher=AnimeNewsNetwork|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime ran almost year-round, which each season beginning in the first week of April and ending on the last week of March. The first season aired on Saturdays, but the show was moved to Fridays for the second and third seasons. The show returned to Saturdays for seasons four, five and six, and the final season aired on Sundays.

[[ADV Films]] had originally added a brief teaser page to their website, announcing their licensing of the anime. The site turned to static before playing a short clip of Keroro dancing to "Afro Gunso," then leaving the message "hacked by the frog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-11-15/sgt-frog-invades-advfilms.com|title=SGT Frog Invades ADVFilms.com|date=November 15, 2006|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a press release from ADV on November 20, 2006, stating that they had licensed all Sgt. Frog properties (except the manga, which was already licensed by [[Tokyopop]]) for the US.&lt;ref name="AVI"/&gt; It was once confirmed that the anime dub would be released on DVD in the United States in February 2007. However, ADV Films had never confirmed a release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-11-20/adv-films-officially-announces-sgt-frog-no-february-release|title=ADV Films Officially Announces Sgt. Frog, No February Release|date=November 20, 2006|publisher=AnimeNewsNetwork|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADV announced at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con International 2007]] that the US release date had been delayed because of TV negotiations but would not comment on which networks they were talking to. In a DVD included with the December issue of Newtype USA was an English-language trailer for Sgt. Frog released by ADV, with voices for Keroro (said to be voiced by [[Vic Mignogna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wha-chow.podomatic.com/entry/2010-09-15T19_46_18-07_00 |title=PodOmatic &amp;#124; Best Free Podcasts |publisher=Wha-chow.podomatic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Natsumi, Fuyuki, Aki, and the narrator. ADV was 90% done on getting a deal with the show, though they created a separate team to work specifically on it that included people from [[Summit Entertainment]] (the company that worked with [[4Kids Entertainment]] during the time they had [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]). They had dubbed three episodes, but they were dubbed three times because ADV created three different pilot-packages for television to see which one worked the best. They made an otaku/fan pilot, a mass-market pilot, and a kids' pilot. They received positive responses from three different networks. [[Cartoon Network]] liked the mass-market pilot, while [[Nickelodeon]] liked the kids' pilot. Nickelodeon told them that they would air the show if ADV got the merchandising rights. However, as of July 4, 2008, the English license for the first 51 episodes of the Sgt. Frog anime was transferred to [[Funimation Entertainment]] through a deal with [[Sojitz]].&lt;ref name="Funimation"/&gt;

Funimation released a dubbed version of episode 12B as a test on [[YouTube]] to be reviewed by the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/9162|title=FUNimation Posts Test Episode of Sgt. Frog|date=November 4, 2008|publisher=Animation Magazine|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many instances of regional name changes were observed; Natsumi is renamed Natalie, and Giroro's cat was renamed "Mr. Furbottom," (despite being female). Additionally, the word Pekopon was changed to Planet Wuss, Pekoponians were referred to as Wussians, and Keron changed to Frogulon. The frogs' names remained the same as the Japanese version, though shortened by one syllable (e.g. Keroro changed to Kero, Tamama to Tama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ5mQPVQmZ8|title=Sgt. Frog - TEST EPISODE - For Review|work=Funimation|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test episode had mixed reviews by fans involving the voice acting, jokes, and name changes.

At Otakon 2009, the first five episodes of ''Sgt. Frog'' were screened, where the original versions of the various names that were changed were used. The voice actor for Sergeant Keroro in the test video, [[Chris Cason]], was swapped out for Sergeant Major Kululu's test actor, [[Todd Haberkorn]]. Kululu was changed to [[Chuck Huber]], and the narrator also appears to have been changed. FUNimation stated at their panel that they were going to keep the anime as similar as possible to its Japanese counterpart, and claimed to only change references from Japanese pop culture (save for those Americans were already familiar with) to references from American pop culture. Those present at the showing seemed to enjoy the changes, and the reception of the official dub was very positive. On February 19, 2011, Funimation announced at [[Katsucon]] that they had licensed more episodes of Sgt. Frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-02-19/funimation-adds-3rd-sgt-frog-anime-season| website= AnimeNewsNetwork.com | title= Funimation Adds 3rd Sgt. Frog Anime Season | date= 19 February 2011 | accessdate= 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Funimation, as of February 2013, ''Sgt. Frog'' is "now on hiatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29314084 |title=Funimation industry panel Katsucon 2013 |location=Washington, DC |author=aquastar83 |publisher=Ustream.tv |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213103523/http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29314084 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2009, Funimation added the first 4 dubbed episodes of the series to their online video portal. After a considerable delay following between the release of the first dubbed episodes, Funimation began making dubbed episodes other than the first 4 available on the portal. Currently, the first 51 subtitled episodes are available on the Funimation video portal and [[Hulu]]. The 51 dubbed episodes later expired, although they were all later placed back on the portal and on Hulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/sgt-frog |title=Sgt. Frog |publisher=Hulu.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is rated TV-PG on the DVDs and on Hulu. Unlike the other versions released outside Japan, the US version remains uncut.

The episode distribution scheme has been slightly changed from the Japanese Region 2 release. Although the first 51 episodes are known as "Season 1" in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00193ZWSW |title=Keroro Gunsou: 1st season DVD-BOX (limited edition)|publisher=Amazon Japan|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation has divided the episodes into a "Season 1" and a "Season 2". The Season 1 Part 1 DVD set was released September 22, 2009. It contains episodes 1 through 13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FOQXVO/ |title=Sgt.

This is relatively incorrect because Sunrise did not create the Gundam series, they produced it, so it should say "from the studio that brought you Gundam". The creator of Gundam is [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]].

All three seasons were available on Netflix streaming as of December 2011; however, the first two seasons, and the first half of the third, were removed without warning in January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Sgt._Frog/70200639?locale=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717074719/http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Sgt._Frog/70200639?locale=en-US |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-17 |title=Sgt. Frog |publisher=Netflix |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the series was completely removed in April of the same year.

On January 7, 2014 it was announced that a new [[flash animation|Flash]] anime television series entitled "Keroro" would premiere on [[Animax]] on March 22 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-01-07/new-sgt-frog-tv-anime-slated-for-march-22|title=New Sgt.

The series airs during the programming block, Keroro Hour, which airs both the series and reruns of Sgt. Frog. The series features new character designs and includes the characters, New Keroro, Tomosu Hinohara, and Myō Kaneami, all of which were originally manga-only characters. The opening to the series is "Keroro☆Popstar" (ケロロ☆ポップスター), performed by [[Mayumi Gojo]]. The flash anime ended on September 6 of the same year, with a total of 23 episodes.

[[Image:Urbeach-high-park-splashpad.jpg|thumb|Urban beach style splash pad located within the municipal swimming baths of Toronto's [[High Park]]]]

A '''splash pad''' or '''spray pool''' is a recreation area, often in a [[public park]], for [[water]] [[play (activity)|play]] that has little or no standing water.  This is said to eliminate the need for [[lifeguard]]s or other supervision, as there is little risk of [[drowning]].

Typically there are ground nozzles that [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]] water upwards out of the splash pad's raindeck.  There may also be other water features such as a rainbow (semicircular pipe shower), or mushroom- or tree-shaped showers. Some splash pads feature movable nozzles similar to those found on [[fire trucks]] to allow users to spray others. The showers and ground nozzles are often controlled by a hand activated-motion sensor, to run for limited time.

Typically the water is either freshwater, or recycled and treated water, that is typically treated to at least the same level of quality as [[swimming pool]] water standards.  These splash pads are often surfaced in textured non-slip concrete or in [[crumb rubber]].

==Definitions==
A typical definition was laid out by a 1986 Heath Act in [[British Columbia]] which stated that a spray pool is "an artificially constructed depression or basin for use by children, into which [[potable water]] is sprayed but not allowed to accumulate in the bottom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/reg/H/Health/Health289_72/289_72.htm#section2 Provisions of the Health Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the city of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], specifically defines a spray pool as "any shallow manmade structure constructed from materials other than natural [[soil|earth or soil]] used for spraying humans with water and which has a drainage area designated to remove the water from the shower or spray [[nozzle]]s at a rate sufficient to prevent the impounding of water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.norfolk.gov/pub_health/Codes.asp |title=City of Norfolk, Virginia: Codes and Regulations of Interest |access-date=2014-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128030624/http://www.norfolk.gov/pub_health/codes.asp |archive-date=2013-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Splash fountains===
[[File:Fountain in Krasnodar.jpg|thumb|right|The Splash Fountain in [[Krasnodar]], Russia. The largest splash fountain in Europe&lt;ref name="Krasnodar"&gt;[http://sergio-zevs.blogspot.com/2011/10/splash-fountain-in-krasnodar.html The Splash Fountain in Krasnodar]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Splash [[fountain]]s, unlike splash pads, encourage use from people of all ages. These fountains are usually designed to be both visually appealing (from a distance) and also interactive. As such, they are designed to allow easy access, often at ground level. They tend to feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards are required. Multiple fountains may start and stop in unison or according to a pattern for artistic effect. While they may be placed in public parks like children's splash pads, splash fountains are also likely to be placed in public squares or at [[urban beach]]es.

==Popularity==
Popular in summertime and especially prevalent in [[city|urban areas]], the spray pool offers an alternative to the practice of opening [[fire hydrant]]s so that children can play and cool off in the water - a practice which is illegal and has been cited as dangerous in that it lowers the [[water pressure]] in a given area and makes [[firefighting]] more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/press_releases/07-30pr.shtml The City of New York]&lt;/ref&gt;  A spray pool does not need to be staffed by qualified [[lifeguards]].

==Common features==
===Spray force===
Depending upon the strength and arc of the flow, the force of the spray can be relatively strong (especially close to the point where the water emerges) or may have more resemblance to [[rainfall]] or even a fine [[mist]]. Many splash pads have some features such as fine mist, that are designed to be moderate enough for children.  Other splash fountains are designed for adults, e.g. for joggers or concert goers to cool off in.

===Drainage===
The area beneath a spray pool typically has [[drainage|drain]] openings so that the water it produces will not [[flood]] the surrounding landscape. In some instances, the water collected in these drains is [[recycled]] back into the spray mechanism, thereby [[water conservation|conserving water]]. Alternatively, the water emanating from the spray [[nozzle]]s may be continually drawn from a [[fresh water|fresh]] [[water supply]].

==Special features==
===Hydraulophones===
[[Image:Hydraulophone45hole-fluteOSC South Division of Pipe Organ.jpg|thumb|One of the features of the circular splash pad in front of the Ontario Science Centre is a [[hydraulophone]] flute with 45 finger holes.  Here a [[hydraulist]] demonstrates hydraulophone technique.]]

[[Hydraulophone]]s are the world's first musical instrument that makes music from vibrations in water.  By pressing on jets of water laid out to a musical scale, hydraulophones make a unique sound.  Hydraulophones have been installed in water parks, museums, and science centres around the world, including the [[Legoland California Resort]], [[Chicago Children's Museum]], and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in [[Toronto]].

===Heating===
The splash fountain at Dundas Square in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs.

==Examples==
Placement and management of spray pools varies according to the municipality in which they are located. For example:
*On [[Boston Common]], the so-called "Frog Pond" (which is a public [[ice-skating rink]] in winter) becomes a spray pool for children in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/OpenSpace_07draft/OSP0812Section7.3.3EN.pdf] Open Space management for [[Emerald Necklace]]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is managed by the Boston Common Frog Pond Foundation and staffed by youth workers from the Boston Youth Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/TTD/frogpond_summer.asp City of Boston: Boston Common Spray Pool]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The spray pool at Phillips Park in [[Aurora, Illinois]] dates from the 1930s and has closed and reopened several times. It is now part of the Phillips Park Family Aquatic Center next to the [[Phillips Park Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aurora-il.org/parksandrecreation/municipalparks/phillipspark/timeline.php Phillips Park - History Time Line]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County|Seattle &amp; King County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] has a "Plan Guide for Water Recreation Facilities - Spray Pools" listing very specific considerations such as the use of non-slip surfaces and the positioning of the spray pools so as to "minimize [[pollution]] by [[dust]], [[smoke]], [[soot]] and other undesirable substances."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrokc.gov/health/pools/spraypools-planguide.doc Seattle &amp; King County, Pool Plan Review Application] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924092241/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/pools/spraypools-planguide.doc |date=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oregon City, Oregon]] has a spray pool at the Oregon City Carnegie Center. Formerly run by the city, the center and its programs recently reopened under the auspices of a private organization called Fine Art Smarts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregoncityparks.org/classes-and-activities/documents/Trailnews_Summer2005.pdf |title=City of Oregon City: Trail News |access-date=2018-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305031827/http://oregoncityparks.org/classes-and-activities/documents/trailnews_summer2005.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occarnegie.org/ Oregon City Carnegie Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fight Club''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) promotion based in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. TFC currently fights at the [[Shaw Conference Centre]].

==Rules==
TFC employs the [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]. Fighters compete in a cage.

===Rounds===
Every round in TFC competition Zaeis five minutes in duration. Title matches have five such rounds, and non-title matches have three. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

===Attire===
All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, [[Keikogi|gis]] or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open-fingered gloves, that include at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, ({{convert|110|to|170|g|oz|abbr=on}} that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple.

===Match outcome===
Matches usually end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps on the mat or his opponent or verbally submits.
*'''Technical Submission''': A technical submission is achieved when the referee stops a fight due to an injury resulting from a submission hold or due to a fighter going unconscious from a choke.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
*'''Technical Knockout''' (TKO): If a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ended as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage: (the referee determines a fighter cannot "intelligently defend" himself; if warnings to the fighter to improve his position or defense go unanswered—generally, two warnings are given, about 5 seconds apart)
**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor due to injury or impending injury, as when blood flows into the eyes and blinds a fighter)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's own corner-man signals defeat for their own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)

Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''', '''technical draw''', or '''no contest'''. The latter two outcomes have no winners.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points.

===Fouls===
The Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 - Unarmed Combat]. Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
* After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). 
* If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
* Grabbing the ring ropes brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the ropes, the referee may charge a foul.

A '''Tour Accountant''' is responsible for the financial operations of a large scale [[concert tour]]. Normally, a Tour Accountant will report to both the [[Tour Manager]] (for all matters regarding tour financial operations), and to the Artist Manager/Business Manager (for overall financial reporting).

From a tour perspective, the Tour Accountant will normally: handle periodic financial transactions (either with Artist Management, or promoter), including per diem draw, wire transfers of both direct (Promoter &gt; Artist Management) and indirect (Promoter &gt; Tour Accountant &gt; Artist Management; usually box office receipts collected at settlement by Tour Accountant) funds, per diem distribution, hotel settlement, currency exchange (international tours), negotiate all local tax issues (concerning Artist earnings in each individual local market), and constantly work to clear up any "grey areas" during the advance, that have the potential to affect show settlement. Although normally, tour members will be paid by either Artist Management/Business Management, or accounting firm, the Tour Accountant will act as the "conduit" between the parties, while the tour is operating.

If a tour is not large enough to warrant utilizing a Tour Accountant, the [[Tour Manager]] will normally assume his/her responsibilities, as listed above. Generally, the only exception to this is if Artist Management travels with tour, and opts to handle the aforementioned.

The path to becoming a Tour Accountant usually involves either advancement through the ranks (a great deal of experience with a specific Artist, or Artist Management company), or via a more traditional route (secondary, post secondary education &amp; degree, followed by employment with either Artist Management company, or specialized Entertainment Accounting company).

==Transversal Acting==
Transversal acting is a unique acting technique that emerged during the Transversal Theater Company's initial attempts to combine theory and practice, and continues to develop through ongoing Transversal Acting Workshops that have been taught in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. It takes as its premise that vulnerabilities, surrenders, and slippages can be more productive than control, domination, and regulation. Actors, sets, props, narratives, objects, histories, media, things, ideas, and experiences all form an interrelational dynamism. Instead of privileging experiences, identities, or narratives as the driving forces of performance and interpretation, transversal acting privileges intensity, contact, and creation.

&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual Military Organizations (VMOs) generally have a presence on the [[internet]], similar to real military organizations. Most VMOs simulate military operations to varying degrees. A newer variant of Virtual Military is the MilSim unit. MilSim units differ from Virtual Military by placing emphasis on the simulation of military tactics in their chosen gaming platform, whereas traditionally, VMOs have placed emphasis on simulating the bigger picture, including a full military career path, logistics systems, coordinated movement of equipment around the world, and prolonged military operations. Although VMOs may appear to be a type of [[Clan (computer gaming)|gaming clan]], a key difference is that a gaming clan's primary purpose is to be an "organized group of players that regularly play together." VMOs are essentially role-playing environments within which an individual can [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immerse]] themselves. ''Realism'' groups are [[Semantic similarity|semantically similar]]; however, their primary focus is usually on following real-life procedures as much as possible. Therefore, [[tactical realism]] and MilSim are almost synonymous in the gaming world. A [[Google Search|Google]]&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=virtual+military|title=virtual military - Google Search|publisher=google.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; search for 'Virtual Military' reveals quite a few VMOs that go to varying degrees of depth to pursue their goal.

Each VMO has their own mission. Some VMOs will simulate an individual military unit, others an entire branch of the military, and yet others attempt to simulate Joint Operations with multiple branches. Most VMOs offer a rank system that provides a career path within the organization. VMOs will often offer a variety of training, in order to allow new members to familiarize themselves with the organization's [[Military doctrine|doctrine]].
[[File:OrganisationMILSIM-VMOCompany.jpg|thumbnail|right|A standard organization of a MILSIM/VMO]]

==Realism vs immersion==
Each VMO chooses to either follow an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] style, a [[Military tactics|realistic]] style, or a combination of both. Immersion as it relates to this topic is the pursuit of a ''feeling'' of complete saturation in a military operation, whereas realism is the rigid following of real-world rules, tactics, and customs of a real-life counterpart. For some people, realism is in fact immersive, so there is an element of crossover between the two terms. While most VMOs will incorporate a [[Military rank|rank structure]], some extend that to incorporate features such as [[Military logistics|Military Logistics]] systems,&lt;ref name="usecforce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usecforce.com/logistics|title=Logistics - Unity Security Force - Virtual Military - Arma 3|publisher=usecforce.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Model (economics)|economics models]],&lt;ref name="fsxbook1"/&gt; awards and medals, and custom debriefing reports.

While each has its benefits and followers, a mix between the two seems to be the most popular option.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1056894|title=Behaviour, realism and immersion in games|publisher=portal.acm.org|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some VMOs can be creative by making their own custom paint schemes, [[Medal|medals]] and award [[Service ribbon|ribbons]],&lt;ref name="freewebs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/gpeo2/awards.htm|title=Awards - GPEO|publisher=freewebs.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; rank insignia, weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and bases (Air bases mostly developed for [[Microsoft Flight Simulator X|Flight Simulator X]]).

Some groups form a historical, political, economic, or persistent battle image or reputation over time. They support various causes and styles of law and order, or internal hierarchy structures. Some groups might form specific government types, ranging from Communism to Fascism, Democracy to Monarchy, and so on. At times, there are even Anarchist rebel groups, or militias that form. Groups might grow to form into completely custom government entities or structures, and on into resembling small nations, with their own flags and codes of honor.

As of 2017, popular games used by the VMO community include ''[[ARMA 3|Arma 3]]'', ''[[Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45]]'', and ''[[Squad_(video_game)|Squad]]'' for land-based simulation, and ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', ''[[Falcon 4.0|Falcon BMS]]'', and ''[[Digital Combat Simulator]]'' for aviation simulation. A few units play games such as ''Call of Duty'' or ''Battlefield'', but mostly those are casual clans, although some attempt to play tactically.&lt;ref name="tacticalgamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacticalgamer.com/|title=Tactical Gamer - The PREMIERE community for mature gamers|publisher=tacticalgamer.com|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Future of Virtual Military Simulation==
It has been reported that Virtual Military groups which originated within the flight simulation genre are once thought to not be as active as previously.&lt;ref name=airspace1/&gt;

As with all types of organizations, the VMO community has seen splits, merges, and closures over time. At the same time, fresh blood has been injected with new VMOs opening. This constant activity promotes [[knowledge transfer]] between groups, and subsequently most VMOs have now standardized their [[business model]] to the point there are very few differences between each of them. Very few have [[Uniqueness|unique]] characteristics. New groups often appear to start out using the business model of the successful VMOs.

Some of the more unique characteristics of VMOs include:

* A [[Military logistics|Military Logistics]] model, where missions cannot be conducted without supplies being brought in first. Then during mission, supplies are finite.
* A [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] model, where the diplomatic and military situation are both simulated and affect one another.
* A [[Persistent world]] model, where the mission [[State_(computer_science)|state]] is maintained using [[Persistence_(computer_science)|persistence]].
* A [[Joint_warfare|Joint Warfare]] model, where multiple units within a group, or multiple groups working together use a [[combined arms]] doctrine to achieve [[full-spectrum dominance]].
* An [[Military_intelligence|intelligence]] model, where the mission is planned using strategic and operational intelligence, and mission commanders are advised by tactical intelligence. This model may include internal and external intelligence gathering, whereby agents seek to infiltrate elements of their own or other groups.
* A [[peacekeeping]] model, whereby the group's missions are primarily based around creating conditions that favor lasting peace. This may include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, as well as post or pre-conflict monitoring and observation.

Successful groups include more than one of the above characteristics into their missions. This creates a rich environment that deepens the immersion for players. According to [[B._J._Fogg|BJ Fogg's]] behavior model&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behaviormodel.org/&lt;/ref&gt;, motivation is closely linked to actions and triggers. In order to successfully create a lasting future for VMOs, it is therefore paramount that groups include triggers and actions that enhance the player's motivation. Since a VMO is essentially an abstraction of a game, group leaders should also consider learning about [[gamification]] in order to create a lasting bond between the player and the group.
