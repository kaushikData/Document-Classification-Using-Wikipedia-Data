'''Aaron Sabaoni''' was an Italian editor of [[Moses Albaz]]'s cabalistic ritual, "[[Hekal ha-Ḳodesh]]," to which he added notes, and which was printed in [[Amsterdam]], 1653. It is conjectured that he was named after the city of [[Sabbionetta]]; but in the seventeenth century he resided in Sale, and, with [[Jacob Sasportas]], participated in the condemnation of the followers of [[Shabbethai Ẓebi]] for refusing to keep the four chief fast-days, on the ground that the Messiah had already arrived.

The '''Alban Hills''' {{in it|Colli Albani}} are the site of a quiescent  [[volcano|volcanic complex]] in [[Italy]], located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Rome]] and  about {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Anzio]].

The dominant peak (but not the highest) is ''[[Monte Cavo]]'' at 950&amp;nbsp;m.  There are two small [[caldera]]s which contain [[lake]]s, [[Lago Albano|Lake Albano]] and [[Lake Nemi]]. The rock of the hills is called [[peperino]] (lapis albanus) a variety of [[tuff]], a combination of [[volcanic ash]] and small rocks that is useful for construction, and provides a mineral-rich substrate for [[vineyard]]s.

==History==
The hills, especially around the shores of the lakes, have been popular since prehistoric times. From the 9th to 7th century BC, there were numerous villages (see the legendary [[Alba Longa]] and [[Tusculum]]). The area was inhabited by the [[Latini]] during the 5th to 3rd centuries BC.

The ancient [[Rome|Romans]] called the hill '''Albanus Mons'''. On the summit was the [[sanctuary]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Latiaris, in which the [[consul]]s celebrated the ''[[Feriae Latinae]]'', and several generals celebrated victories here during times when they were not accorded regular [[Roman Triumph|triumph]]s in Rome.  The foundations and some of the architectural fragments of the temple were still in existence until 1777, when they were used to build the [[Passionists|Passionist]] monastery by [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Cardinal York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Albanus Mons|volume=1|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''Via Triumphalis'' leading up to it can still be seen.

In Roman times, the area was often used by the rich as a way to escape the heat and crowds of Rome, as it is today as shown by the many [[villa]]s and country houses present.

{{Freemasonry}}
The question of whether [[Freemasonry]] is [[Anticlerical]] is the subject of debate. The [[Catholic Church]] has long been an outspoken [[Papal ban of Freemasonry|critic of Freemasonry]], and some scholars have often accused the fraternity of [[anticlericalism]].{{sfn|Gruber|1910}} The Catholic Church forbids its members to join any Masonic society under pain of [[interdict]]ion. Freemasons usually take a diametrically opposite view, stating that there is nothing in Freemasonry that is in any way contrary to Catholicism or any other religious faith.

Whether Freemasonry is Anticlerical often depends on how one defines Anticlericalism and what branch of Freemasonry one is talking about.

== Anglo-American Freemasonry v. continental Freemasonry ==

Starting in the late eighteenth century, and rapidly expanding in the nineteenth, Freemasonry became polarized over the issue of whether the discussion of religion and politics was appropriate in lodges.  Those Grand Lodges that adhered to the [[Anglo-American form of Freemasonry]] maintained a strict rule that such discussion was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ridley |first=Jasper |title=The Freemasons |location=New York |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2001 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2013}}{{Verification needed|date=September 2015}} Historian John Robinson notes this fact in reaching the conclusion that Freemasonry is not anticlerical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John J. |last=Robinson |title=A Pilgrim's Path |publisher=M. Evans and Company|location=New York |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2013}}{{Verification needed|date=September 2015}}

The fact that the Continental branch of Freemasonry was concentrated in traditionally Catholic countries may account for the fact that the fraternity has been seen by Catholic critics as an outlet for anti-Catholic disaffection. Many particularly [[anti-clerical]] regimes in traditionally Catholic countries were perceived as having a strong Masonic element.&lt;ref&gt;"In France, in 1877, and in Portugal in 1910, Freemasons took control of the government for a time and enacted laws to restrict the activities of the Church, particularly in education. In Latin America, the Freemasons have expressed anti-Church and anti-clerical sentiment." {{harv|Saunders|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent of the anticlericalism ==
According to historians [[Christopher Clark]] and [[Wolfram Kaiser]], Freemasonry was not anticlerical from the outset. They state that this changed in the nineteenth century (in part because of measures by the Catholic Church) and that Freemasonry (mostly continental Freemasonry), developed an anticlerical outlook.{{sfn|Clark|Kaiser|2003|pp=54-55}} They note, however, that the influence of freemasonry should not be given too much weight; even in Italy it was eclipsed in influence by non-Masonic groups such as the [[Carbonari]].{{sfn|Clark|Kaiser|2003|p=55}}
They also note that lodges did not hold one consistent political line, many being completely apolitical.{{sfn|Clark|Kaiser|2003|p=213}}

=== Spain ===

The historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] believed that the influence of Freemasonry has often been overstated noting that Spanish Catholics had been accused of suffering from a "Masonic psychosis"{{sfn|Payne|1984|p=127}} and notes that, numbering near 65,000 in 1890, “they sometimes figured prominently in Spanish liberalism and republicanism, but their direct collective influence on both politics and anticlericalism has doubtless been considerably exaggerated".{{sfn|Payne|1984|p=127}}

=== Portugal ===
According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], members of the Masonic lodges played a major role in the rise of Portuguese liberalism and anticlericalism. However, he notes that the fraternity was not always united in opinion.  Masons were found on both sides of the Gomes da Freire revolt in 1817. In 1820, however, Masons were devoted almost unanimously to the liberal cause in politics, and in the 1830s they had become the principal promoters of anticlericalism.  After the triumph of constitutionalism, however, Portuguese Freemasonry split into more radical and more conservative groups, and by the 1860s it had ceased to play a catalytic role in politics. The upper middle class, established in power and wealth, were less attracted to it, and by the late nineteenth century Masons were drawn mainly from the lower middle class ranks of white-collar employees. Its place in radical politics at the turn of the century was taken over largely by secret republican radical political societies, especially the non-masonic Carbonária, and by 1912 the Masons had fewer than 3,000 members.{{sfn|Payne|1973|loc=Chapter 22}}

=== Germany ===
The Papal encyclical [[Etsi multa]] of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1873 claimed that Freemasonry was the motivating force behind the [[Kulturkampf]]: "Some of you may perchance wonder that the war against the Catholic Church extends so widely. Indeed each of you knows well the nature, zeal, and intention of sects, whether called Masonic or some other name. When he compares them with the nature, purpose, and amplitude of the conflict waged nearly everywhere against the Church, he cannot doubt but that the present calamity must be attributed to their deceits and machinations for the most part. For from these the synagogue of Satan is formed which draws up its forces, advances its standards, and joins battle against the Church of Christ." &lt;ref&gt;Para 28, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/encyc/p9etsimu.htm Etsi Multa].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] also claims that the Kulturkampf was instigated by Masonic lodges.&lt;ref name="KulturCE"&gt;"They also instigated the "Kulturkampf". The celebrated jurisconsult and Mason, [[Grandmaster Bluntschli]], was one of the foremost agitators in this conflict; he also stirred up the Swiss "Kulturkampf"." From [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09771a.htm Masonry (Freemasonry)] in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] and "German Freemasons fostered the Kulturkampf and helped further the dominance of the Prussian state." ''[http://www.trosch.org/bks/freemasonry.html Freemasonry]', ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1967 ed, Volume 6, p 135, McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
The rivalry between the Catholic Church and the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]] led to the foundation of the [[Free University of Brussels]] which was founded largely by Belgian Freemasons concerned at the expansion of Catholic influence within Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;'''Universite Libre de Bruxelles''', Page 312, Historical dictionary of Brussels, by Paul F. State.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In the Papal constitution [[Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo]] (1821) Pope [[Pius VII]] linked the anticlerical Italian secret society, the [[Carbonari]] to Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="ecclesiam"&gt;"It also links Freemasonry with the Society of the Carbonari, known as the "Charcoal Burners", who at that time were active in Italy and were believed to be a revolutionary group." [http://www.bessel.org/cathtlor.htm Roman Catholic Church Law Regarding Freemasonry] by Reid McInvale, Texas Lodge of Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between [[Italian unification]] (1870) and the [[Lateran Treaties]] (1929) there was a cold war between the Papacy and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]). The Papal Encyclical [[Etsi Nos]],&lt;ref name="etsinos"&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ITL.HTM Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy)], promulgated by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; complained about the way in which post-unification Italy denigrated the role of the church,&lt;ref name="etsirel"&gt;"If ever these perils were menacing in Italy they are surely so now, at a time when the condition of the Civil State itself disastrously imperils the freedom of religion." Paragraph 1, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ITL.HTM Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy)].&lt;/ref&gt; which the Vatican blamed primarily on Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="etsinosfm"&gt;"It is even reported that this year it is about to receive the deputies and leaders of the sect which is most embittered against Catholicism, who have appointed this city as the place for their solemn meeting. The reasons which have determined their choice of such a meeting place are no secret; they desire by this outrageous provocation to glut the hatred which they nourish against the Church, and to bring their incendiary torches within reach of the Roman Pontificate by attacking it in its very seat." Paragraph 3, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ITL.HTM Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benito Mussolini]] decreed in 1924 that every member of his [[Fascist Party]] who was a Mason must abandon either one or the other organization, and in 1925, he dissolved Freemasonry in Italy, claiming that it was a political organisation with anti-religious influence.  One of the most prominent Fascists, General Cappello, who had also been Deputy Grand Master of the Grande Oriente, Italy's leading [[Grand Lodge]], gave up his membership in the Fascist Party rather than in Masonry. He was later arrested on false charges and sentenced to 30 years in jail.&lt;ref name="TTISTF"&gt;'The Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction', Alphonse Cerza, published by the Masonic Service Association, September 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostility to Freemasonry shaped much of the Catholic Church's strategy in regard to the newly established Italian state. For example, in the encyclical [[Custodi di quella fede]] [[Leo XIII]] warned against Catholics becoming involved with liberal groups&lt;ref name="custodi1"&gt;"Every familiarity should be avoided, not only with those impious libertines who openly promote the character of the sect, but also with those who hide under the mask of universal tolerance, respect for all religions, and the craving to reconcile the maxims of the Gospel with those of the revolution. These men seek to reconcile Christ and Belial, the Church of God and the state without God." Para 15, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13MS3.HTM Custodi di Quella Fede].&lt;/ref&gt; and asked Catholics to become more involved in forms of [[Catholic Action]] away from the "Masonic" state.&lt;ref&gt;"Masonry has confiscated the inheritance of public charity; fill the void, then, with the treasure of private relief." Para 18, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13MS3.HTM Custodi di Quella Fede].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Italian politicians in the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] and [[Forza Italia]] accused “radical and Masonic” groups of being behind a threatened investigation by the [[European Commission]] of whether or not the tax-exempt status of the Church’s hospitals, schools, and other social service organizations should be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=10274 Politicians say Masons behind investigation of the Church in Italy], Catholic News Agency, August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
The [[Mexican Revolution]] was seen by Cardinal [[William Henry O'Connell]] in 1914 as part of a "Masonic conspiracy" in conjunction with the [[Protestantism in the United States|North American Protestants]].  O'Connell and the [[American Federation of Catholic Societies]] urged U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] to not recognize the Mexican government, as the Catholic clergy were increasingly stigmatized as collective enemies of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1914/11/16/archives/calls-it-masonic-conspiracy-cardinal-oconnell-assails-leaders-of.html Calls It Masonic Conspiracy; Cardinal O'Connell Assails Leaders of Mexican Revolution], November 16, 1914, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;page 206, The Mexican Revolution, Alan Knight, {{ISBN|0803277717}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican government]]'s [[Calles Law|anticlerical stance]] after the [[Mexican Revolution]] coincided with a succession of [[president]]s who were "Masons and strongly anticlerical".&lt;ref name="yorkriteinmex"&gt;"After the defeat and exile of the dictator in the 1910 revolution, a succession of Presidents who were Masons and strongly anticlerical ruled the country under the 1917 Constitution that maintained substantially the same liberal principles of 1857."

Salinas E., Past Senior Grand Warden - York Grand Lodge of [[Mexico]] (as hosted on the web page of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of Mexico).&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Vicente Fox]] (2000-2006) would state: "After 1917, Mexico was led by anti-Catholic Freemasons who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Juarez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez." &lt;ref&gt;Fox, Vicente and Rob Allyn [https://books.google.com/books?id=bLDDf9vi-esC&amp;dq Revolution of Hope] p. 17, Viking, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite for his actions against the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002 , Volume XXV, Number 1] by Olivier Lelibre, [[The Angelus (magazine)|The Angelus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 Pedro Marquez of the [[Grand Lodge of the Valley of Mexico]], in discussing a call by the Church to lift the ban in the Mexican constitution against Catholic schools and newspapers, stated "The [[Catholic hierarchy]] wants to dictate a political policy and that is a very grave error, as our society is no longer in the era of Christianity and priests are no longer viceroys of [[New Spain]]," and that "There is a tendency in the Church to meddle in the social and political affairs of Mexico, but the priests should return to their Churches".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=10087 Mexican masons lament decline of influence and launch new attack on the Church], Catholic News Agency, August 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecuador ===

Some attributed to Freemasonry the assassination of [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] who twice served as [[President of Ecuador]] (1859-1865 and 1869-1875) and was assassinated during his second term, just days before he was to take office for his third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06379b.htm|title=Gabriel García Moreno|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his [[conservatism]] and [[Catholic]] religious perspective.

Part of the animosity García Moreno generated was because of his friendship toward the [[Society of Jesus]], and during a period of their exile, he helped a group of displaced Jesuits find refuge in Ecuador.  He had also advocated legislation which would outlaw secret societies.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Peter V. N.  "Gabriel Garcia Moreno and Conservative State Formation in the Andes" p. 28 University of Texas Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0292719035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This action and many similar ones encouraged the anti-Catholic parties of Ecuador, especially the [[Freemasonry|Masons]], to see in him an inveterate enemy.  The 1869 constitution made Catholicism the established religion of the state. He was the only ruler in the world to protest the Pope's loss of the Papal States, and two years later had the legislature consecrate Ecuador to the Sacred Heart.  One of his biographers writes that after the public consecration, he was condemned to die by German Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica, ''Gabriel Garcia Moreno, Regenerator of Ecuador'', p. 152. London, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was elected a third time in 1875, he and many of his supporters considered it to be a death warrant. He wrote immediately to [[Pope Pius IX]] asking for his blessing before inauguration day on August 30: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I wish to obtain your blessing before that day, so that I may have the strength and light which I need so much in order to be unto the end a faithful son of our Redeemer, and a loyal and obedient servant of His Infallible Vicar. Now that the Masonic Lodges of the neighboring countries, instigated by [[Germany]], are vomiting against me all sorts of atrocious insults and horrible calumnies, now that the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodges]] are secretly arranging for my assassination, I have more need than ever of the divine protection so that I may live and die in defense of our holy religion and the beloved republic which I am called once more to rule.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

García Moreno's prediction was correct; he was assassinated exiting the Cathedral in [[Quito]], struck down with knives and revolvers, his last words being: "¡Dios no muere!" ("God does not die!")

On August 5, shortly before his assassination, a priest visited García Moreno and warned him, "You have been warned that your death was decreed by the Freemasons; but you have not been told when. I have just heard that the assassins are going to try and carry out their plot at once.  For God's sake, take your measures accordingly!"&lt;ref&gt;Berthe, P. Augustine, translated from French by Mary Elizabeth
Herbert [https://books.google.com/books?id=Akr838XsIO0C&amp;dq Garcia Moreno, President of Ecuador, 1821-1875] p. 297, 1889 Burns and Oates.&lt;/ref&gt;  García Moreno replied that he had already received similar warnings and after calm reflection concluded that the only measure he could take was to prepare himself to appear before God.&lt;ref&gt;Berthe, P. Augustine, translated from French by Mary Elizabeth

'''Ayagunna''' is the youngest path, or avatar, of the undergod [[Obatala]] in the Lukumi ([[Santería]]) pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1JZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ayagunna&amp;dq=Ayagunna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_7SfrfDcAhVq3IMKHQR1BKc4ChDoAQg5MAQ|title=El Padre Obatalá: creador del hombre|last=Izaguirre|first=Héctor|year=1998|publisher=Panapo|language=es|isbn=9803661639|edition=1st|location=Caracas|oclc=41955246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manifestation, Obatala is a youth who battles with a scimitar. He is credited with having spread gunpowder throughout the world. In addition, he traveled to Asia, where he warred against and defeated his enemies, taking their heads with him as evidence of his destruction. The normally peaceful and calm Obatala manifests a fierceness and thirst for peace by way of domination in this aspect.

In the [[Lucumi (religion)|Lukumi]] system, Ayagunna can turn out to be one's governing [[orisha]]. His receptacle contains the requisite items of Obatala as well as additional ones that are designated only to that path. When one receives Ochanla, one must already be in possession of Ayagunna or receive him along with her. Although Obatala eats female animals due to his duality and age, after receiving Ochanla, the adherent must feed Ayagunna male animals and Ochanla female. Ayagunna is often envisioned in a similar fashion to [[Shango]]. He is a member of the fun-fun (white) court of Obatala as a divine king, as are all of his other manifestations. When his adherents manifest his energies during religious trance sessions, Ayagunna behaves with swift, strong, and battle-like movements. Hence, he is the paladin among orishas.
His children are often mistaken for children of Shango.

Ayagunna wears all white with the exception of a diagonal red sash that bisects his tunic. The ''patakis'' or stories of the faith state that [[Olodumare|Olofin]] put Ayagunna in charge of bringing order to the earth since man had been left to his own devices. At first, Ayagunna asked the people to bring their lives in line with the laws of Olofi, but they ignored his requests.  After a while, Ayagunna grew less and less patient and finally stopped making requests and took more punitive measures by executing those who refused to obey. Word got back to Olofi, and he traveled to our world from Ara Onu to see for himself what Ayagunna had wrought. When Ayagunna saw Olofi coming, he wiped his scimitar across his chest to clean the blood from its blade. Olofi scolded Ayagunna for causing such confusion, but Ayagunna then responded in a lawyerly fashion: "Father, without conflict, there can be no progress". Olofi considered his words and agreed.

Ayagunna is also known for being the breeder of conflict and war. His name literally means "war dog".

Ayagunna said the day he lays down his sword, the world will cease to exist.

Ayagunna is a Spanish mispronunciation of the proper Yoruba Ajaguna. In Spanish, the j sounds like a y.

[[Buddhism]] has interacted with several [[East Asian religions]] such as Confucianism and Shintoism since it spread from [[India]] during the 2nd century AD.

==Confucianism==
{{main|Confucianism}}

[[Confucianism]] in particular raised fierce opposition to Buddhism in early history, principally because it perceived Buddhism to be a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] [[worldview]], with a negative impact on society at large. "The [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianists]]
had therefore to attack Buddhist cosmological views by affirming, in the
firstplace, the reality and concreteness of the universe and of man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5443&amp;context=opendissertations Early Neo-Confucian View of Chinese Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shintoism==
{{main|Shintoism}}
{{quote|Before Prince Shotoku made Buddhism the national religion of Japan, many opposed the integration of Buddhism into Japan. Once this forced integration occurred, Japan synchronized Buddhism with its native religion Shinto, resulting in a unique sect of Buddhism existing only on the East Asian Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eholody.xomba.com/the_synchronization_of_shinto_and_buddhism_in_japan The Synchronization of Shinto and Buddhism in Japan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516184128/http://eholody.xomba.com/the_synchronization_of_shinto_and_buddhism_in_japan |date=May 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Japan]]ese religion of [[Shinto]], the long coexistence of Buddhism and Shintoism resulted in the merging of Shintoism and Buddhism. Gods in Shintoism were given a position similar to that of Hindu gods in Buddhism.  Moreover, because the Buddha [[Vairochana]]'s symbol was the sun, many equated [[Amaterasu]], the sun goddess, as his previous [[bodhisattva]] reincarnation. The later [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] era saw a revival of Shinto, and some Shinto scholars began to argue that Buddhas were previous incarnations of Shinto gods, reversing the traditional positions of the two religions. Shinto and Buddhism were officially separated during the [[Meiji Restoration]] and the brief, but socially transformative rise of [[State Shinto]] followed. In post-war modern Japan, most families count themselves as being of both religions, despite the idea of "official separation".
{{quote|As time went on, the Japanese became more and more accustomed to including both the kami and Buddhist ideas in their spiritual lives. Philosophers put forward the idea that the kami were "transformations of the Buddha manifested in Japan to save all sentient beings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/history/history_1.shtml Shinto history]: [[BBC|BBC Religions]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Taoism==
{{main|Taoism}}
{{see also|Zen}}
The relationships between [[Taoism]] and Buddhism are complex, as they influenced each other in many ways while often competing for influence. Taoism in its early form was a mixture of early mythology, folk religion, and Taoist philosophy. The arrival of Buddhism forced Taoism to renew and restructure itself into a more organized religion, while addressing similar existential questions raised by Buddhism. Early Buddhism was sometimes seen as a kind of foreign relative of Taoism and its scriptures were often translated into Chinese with Taoist vocabulary. [[Ch'an Buddhism]] in particular holds many beliefs in common with philosophical Taoism.
{{quote|Daoist (Taoist) simplicity stimulated Chan's abandonment of Buddhist theory and was accompanied by another traditional Daoist feature—the emphasis on total absorption in practice of a highly cultivated skill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.cultural-china.com/en/166History5060.html Taoism and Buddhism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522101914/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/166History5060.html |date=2012-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Caspar Sibelius''' (9 June 1590 – 1 January 1658), was a Dutch Protestant minister.

==Biography==
Sibelius was born in Elberfeld (near [[Wuppertal]]) and was trained in [[Herborn Academy|Herborn]] and [[Siegen]] before attending [[Leiden University]] to study theology under [[Gomarus]] and [[Arminius]], and Hebrew under [[Coddaeus]].&lt;ref name=Aa&gt;Caspar Sibelius by [[Abraham Jacob van der Aa]]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return he became minister in [[Randerode]] (where he married the mayor's daughter Maria Klock, in 1610), [[Geilenkirchen]] and [[Gulik]]. In 1617 he was sent to [[the Hague]], where he received a stipend for preaching in [[Nijmegen]]. He was called the same year to [[Deventer]], where he stayed for 30 years until leaving service in 1648.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt;

In 1618 he attended the Overijssel Synod in Vollenhove and was chosen there to represent Overijssel in the [[Synod of Dordrecht]], though he returned sick with fever in 1619 to Deventer. He was later chosen as revisor of the [[New Testament]] and [[Apocryphal gospels]].&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; In 1633–1634, he worked on the translation of the [[Statenvertaling|Staten-Bible]] in the house of [[Antonius Walaeus]], professor of religion, on the [[Rapenburg]] in [[Leiden]]. He was there along with the original living translators, and the paid observers:
# as representative of Overijssel with the revisers of the New Testament were Henricus Arnoldi van der Linden, minister at Delft and son of the earlier translator, for South Holland,
# Willem van Nieuwenhuizen (Guilhelmus Nieuhusius), rector of the school at Haerlem, for North Holland,
# Karel Dematius (Carolus Dematius), minister at Middelburg, for Zeeland,
# Ludovicus Gerardus à Renesse, minister at Maarsen, for Utrecht.

Appointed revisors who were unable to come that day:
# [[Sebastian Damman]], minister at Zutphen, who had also been one of the scribes at the Synod of Dordrecht, for Gelderland, due to imprisonment by the Spanish
# [[Johann Heinrich Alting|Henricus Alting]], who as professor of divinity at Heidelberg had also been called to the Synod of Dordrecht by the Elector Palatine, but was now professor of divinity at Groningen, for Groningen, due to travel in Germany
# [[Bernardus Fullenius]], minister at Leeuwarden, who was also one of the revisers of the Old Testament, for Friesland, due to being unable to get permission to travel to Leiden.

Sibelius died in Deventer.

'''Christianity''' is a minority religion in [[Muslim]]-majority [[Somalia]], with an estimated 10,000 practitioners in a population of over eight million inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Angpl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.anglicanplanet.net/international-news/2009/11/30/almost-expunged-somalias-embattled-christians.html|title=Almost expunged: Somalia's Embattled Christians |date=October 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf|title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1|version=2008 revision |format=.PDF|publisher=United Nations|author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division|year=2009|accessdate=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Christian]] adherents come from the [[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantu]] ethnic minority group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/7d1fc87ed568612dc1256c0c004a2463 A study on minorities in Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt; or are descended from Italian colonists and belong to the Evangelical and Wesleyan [[Church of the Nazarene]]. There is one [[Catholicism|Catholic]] diocese for the entire country, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio|Diocese of Mogadishu]].

==Overview==
{{main article|Roman Catholicism in Somalia}}
[[File:Mogadischu Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|110px|The [[Mogadishu Cathedral]]]]
The Diocese of Mogadishu estimates that there were about 100 [[Roman Catholic]] practitioners in Somalia in 2004. This was down from a high of 8,500 adherents at the start of the [[Trust Territory of Somalia|trusteeship period]] in 1950, under the Prefecture Apostolic of Benadir of the Vicariate Apostolic of Mogadiscio.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic Church in Somalia|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmgds.html|publisher=Diocese of Mogadishu|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-seven years earlier, in 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories. Around 100–200 followers existed in the schools and [[orphanage]]s of the few Catholic [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church'', Volume 14, (Robert Appleton company: 1913), p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; No Catholic missions are known to have existed in [[Italian Somaliland]] during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Henry Robinson, ''History of Christian Missions'', (Read BOoks: 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after [[World War I]] Catholicism started to be promoted in "Somalia italiana", as Listowel wrote:

{{Quote|''In 1903 the Trinitarian Fathers were the first missionaries to arrive in what was to become Somalia. They started teaching and providing social assistance to the poor and the sick. Fr. Jelib set up a leper colony at the mouth of the Juba river, and cared for about 350 to 400 lepers. In 1924 the Consolata Fathers and Sisters (from Turin) arrived; the Fathers to be replaced in the 1930s by the Franciscan Friars Minor from the Milan Province.''}}

In 1928, a Catholic cathedral was built in Mogadishu by order of [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]], a Catholic governor of "Somalia italiana" who promoted the "Missionari della Consolata" Christianization of Somali people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asei.eu/it/2011/11/le-missioni-cattoliche-italiane-allestero-il-caso-della-consolata-nella-somalia-di-cesare-maria-de-vecchi-1924-1928/ The Catholic missionaries of "Consolata" promoted by governor De Vecchi (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral, the biggest in Africa in the 1920s and 1930s, was later damaged during the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] that began in the 1980s.

The Bishop of Mogadishu, Franco Filippini, declared in 1940 that there were about 40,000 Somali Catholics due to the work of missionaries in the rural regions of Juba and Shebelle, but [[World War II]] damaged in an irreversible way most of the Catholic missions in [[Italian Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tripodi, Paolo. ''The Colonial Legacy in Somalia''. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Most were Somali Bantu,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delcampe.it/item.php?language=I&amp;id=300946190 Photo of Somali Bantu with a Missionary of the "Consolata" in 1937]&lt;/ref&gt; but some thousands were illegitimate sons of Italian soldiers and Somalian girls (who received Italian citizenship when baptized).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The [[Bible]] was first translated into Somali only in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Version Information|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Somali-Bible-SOM/|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'', the Somalia Believers Fellowship, the Somalia Mennonite Mission and the [[Seventh-day Adventists]] are present in this country.&lt;ref&gt;''World Christian Encyclopedia'', (2nd edition), Volume 1, p.&amp;nbsp;673&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia is included in the Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa of the [[Anglican Diocese of Egypt]], though there are no current local congregations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dioceseofegypt.org/explore/horn-of-africa/ The Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adventist Mission]] indicates that there are no Adventist members in Somalia, and that [[Christianity]] in general has seen little growth there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mission's Top 10 Places to Pray for – Region: North Africa – Somalia|url=http://www.adventistmission.org/article.php?id=1364|publisher=Adventist Mission|accessdate=7 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001035012/http://www.adventistmission.org/article.php?id=1364|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution by Muslims==
Due to the ongoing [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the southern part of the country, professing Christians in Somalia have faced persecution and sometimes death. Apart from [[Mogadishu Cathedral]] (which is no longer used for Christian services, although in 2013 plans to repair it were announced by the Diocese of Mogadiscio), there are no [[church (building)|church]] buildings in the country. Nor is there any legal protection for Christians, some of whom meet in underground churches.&lt;ref name="Angpl"/&gt;

Paramilitary groups in Somalia have also engaged in widespread looting of Christian graves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=34745|title=Widspread &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; desecration of Christian graves in Somalia|work=Catholic World News|publisher=Trinity Publications|date=January 19, 2005|access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the desecration of [[Sufi]] [[Muslim]] graves and [[mosque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheikh|first=Abdi|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/19/us-somalia-conflict-idUSTRE59I1HQ20091019|title=Shabaab rebels destroy grave and mosque in Somalia|work= |agency=Reuters|date=October 19, 2009|access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term "Christian" was a label that the jihadists would affix on people they suspected of working for [[Ethiopia]]n [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Angpl"/&gt;

In August 2009, [[International Christian Concern]] reported that four Christians working to help orphans in Somalia were beheaded by Islamist extremists when they refused to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539129,00.html |title=Al Shabaab Reportedly Beheads 4 Christians, Rips Gold Teeth From Locals' Mouths |publisher=FOX News |date=August 12, 2009 |author= |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Religious Affairs released a directive prohibiting the celebration of Christian festivities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khalif|first=Abdulkadir|title=Somalia bans Christmas celebrations|url=http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/Somalia-bans-Christmas-celebrations/-/1950946/2125192/-/format/xhtml/-/774d8c/-/index.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Nation|date=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Everett Hale''' (April 3, 1822&amp;nbsp;– June 10, 1909) was an American author, historian, and [[Christian Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].

==Biography==
Hale was born on April 3, 1822,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 41. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]] (1784–1863), proprietor and editor of the ''Boston Daily Advertiser'', and Sarah Preston Everett; and the brother of [[Lucretia Peabody Hale]], [[Susan Hale]], and [[Charles Hale]]. Edward Hale was a nephew of [[Edward Everett]], the orator and statesman, and grand-nephew of [[Nathan Hale]] (1755-1776), the Revolutionary War hero executed by the British for espionage. Edward Everett Hale was also a descendant of [[Richard Everett]] and related to [[Helen Keller]].

Hale was a [[child prodigy]] who exhibited extraordinary literary skills. He graduated from [[Boston Latin School]] at age 13&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/Edward-Everett-Hale.php |publisher=Harvard Square Library |title=Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909) |accessdate=21 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124004405/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/Edward-Everett-Hale.php |archivedate=24 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and enrolled at [[Harvard College]] immediately after. There, he settled in with the literary set, won two [[Bowdoin prize]]s and was elected the Class Poet.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; He graduated second in his class in 1839&lt;ref name=Hall156&gt;Hall, Timothy L. ''American Religious Leaders''. Infobase Publishing, 2003: 156. {{ISBN|0-8160-4534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then studied at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. Decades later, he reflected on the new liberal theology there:

{{quote|text=The group of leaders who surrounded Dr. [[William Ellery Channing|[William Ellery] Channing]] had, with him, broken forever from the fetters of Calvinistic theology. These young people were trained to know that human nature is not totally depraved. They were taught that there is nothing of which it is not capable... For such reasons, and many more, the young New Englanders of liberal training rushed into life, certain that the next half century was to see a complete moral revolution in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 19. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Susan and Edward Everett Hale.png|thumb|left|Edward Everett Hale with his sister Susan in 1855]]
Hale was licensed to preach as a [[Christian Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister in 1842&lt;ref name=Hall156/&gt; by the Boston Association of Ministers. In 1846 he became pastor of the Church of the Unity in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; Hale married Emily Baldwin Perkins in 1852; she was the niece of Connecticut Governor and U.S. Senator [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]] and [[Emily Pitkin Perkins]] Baldwin on her father's side and [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Henry Ward Beecher]] on her mother's side. They had nine children: Alexander, b &amp; d 1853; [[Ellen Day Hale|Ellen Day]], 1854–1939; Arthur, 1859–1939;Charles Alexander, 1861–1867;  Edward Everett, Jr., 1863–1932; [[Philip Leslie Hale]], 1865–1931; Herbert Dudley, 1866–1908; Henry Kidder, 1868–1876; Robert Beverly, 1869–1895.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hale Family Papers"/&gt;

Hale left the Unity Church in 1856 to become pastor at the South Congregational Church, Boston, where he served until 1899.

In 1847 Hale was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; and he would be involved with the society for the rest of his life, taking up various positions in the service of the society.  He served two non-consecutive terms on its board of councilors, from 1852 to 1854, and a lengthy term from 1858 to 1891, and as recording secretary from 1854 to 1858.  He served as vice-president of the society from 1891 to 1906, served a shorter term as president from 1906 to 1907, then again took up the position of vice-president from 1907 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, B. (1987).  ''Members and Officers of the American Antiquarian Society''. Worcester: American Antiquarian Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale first came to notice as a writer in 1859, when he contributed the short story "My Double and How He Undid Me" to the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. He soon published other stories in the same periodical. His best known work was "[[The Man Without a Country]]", published in the ''Atlantic'' in 1863 and intended to strengthen support for the Union cause in the North.&lt;ref name=Hall156/&gt; As in some of his other non-romantic tales, he employed a minute realism which led his readers to suppose the narrative a record of fact. These two stories and such others as "The Rag-Man and the Rag-Woman" and "The Skeleton in the Closet", gave him a prominent position among short-story writers of 19th century America. His short story "[[The Brick Moon]]", serialized in the ''Atlantic Monthly'', is the first known fictional description of an artificial [[satellite]]. It was possibly an influence on the novel ''[[The Begum's Fortune]]'' by [[Jules Verne]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1865.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his support for the Union during the [[American Civil War]], Hale was elected as a Third Class Companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].

Hale assisted in founding the [[Christian Examiner|''Christian Examiner, Old and New'']] in 1869 and became its editor.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; The story "Ten Times One is Ten" (1870), with its hero Harry Wadsworth, contained the motto, first enunciated in 1869 in his [[Lowell Institute]] lectures: "Look up and not down, look forward and not back, look out and not in, and lend a hand."  This motto was the basis for the formation of Lend-a-Hand Clubs, Look-up Legions and Harry Wadsworth Clubs for young people. Out of the romantic Waldensian story "In His Name" (1873) there similarly grew several other organizations for religious work, such as King's Daughters, and King's Sons. In 1875, the ''Christian Examiner'' merged with Scribner's Magazine.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; In 1881, Hale published the story "Hands Off" in ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine''. In the tale, a narrator goes through time to alter events in the past, thereby creating an alternate timeline. [[Paul J. Nahin]] writes that this story makes Hale a pioneer in emerging science fiction, time travel, and stories about changing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Nahin, Paul J. ''Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction''. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1999: 54. {{ISBN|0-387-98571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1880s Harriet E. "Hattie" Freeman became one of Hale's volunteer secretaries. Her family had been connected with Hale's church since 1861. As Hattie and Hale worked together they grew closer and closer. According to historian Sara Day, their relationship became loving and intimate. Day came to this conclusion after studying 3,000 Hale-Freeman love letters (1884-1909) held by the Library of Congress. The letters, donated to the library in 1969, had held their secrets until 2006 when Day realized that the intimate passages were written in Towndrow's shorthand.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Sara "Coded Letters, Concealed Love, The Larger Lives of Harriet Freeman and Edward Everett Hale." New Academia Publishing, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Hale founded ''Lend a Hand'', which merged with the ''Charities Review'' in 1897, and the ''Lend a Hand Record''.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; Throughout his life he contributed many articles on a variety of subjects to the periodicals of his day including the ''North American Review'', the ''Atlantic Monthly'', the ''Christian Register'', the ''Outlook'', and many more.&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)"/&gt; He was the author or editor of more than sixty books—fiction, travel, sermons, biography and history.&lt;ref name="Hale Family Papers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss90_bioghist.html |publisher= Smith College Northampton, MA, Hale family papers |title=Hale Family Papers |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale retired as minister from the South Congregational Church in 1899 and chose as his successor Edward Cummings, father of [[E. E. Cummings]].&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, Christopher. ''E. E. Cummings: A Biography''. Illinois: Sourcebooks, 2004: 12. {{ISBN|1-57071-775-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, Hale was recognized as among the nation's most important men of letters. Bostonians asked him to help ring in the new century on December 31, 1900, by presenting a psalm on the balcony of the [[Massachusetts State House]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Timothy L. ''American Religious Leaders''. Infobase Publishing, 2003: 156–157. {{ISBN|0-8160-4534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he became [[Chaplain of the United States Senate]], and joined the [[Literary Society of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaulding|first=Thomas M.|title=The Literary Society in Peace and War|year=1947|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Literary_Society_in_Peace_and_War.html?id=JkHlAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he was elected as a member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Hale lived from 1869 to his death at the [[Edward Everett Hale House]] in Roxbury.&lt;ref name=kennell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.k12.ma.us/obryant/academics/socialstudies/heritagetrail/Edward.htm |title=The Edward Everett Hale House |author=Mr. Kennell's A.P.

He maintained a [[Hale House (South Kingston, Rhode Island)|summer home]] in [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]] where he and his family often spent summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pettaquamscutt.org/halehouse.htm |title=Edward Everett Hale House |publisher= Pettaquamscutt Historical Society |accessdate= 20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale died in Roxbury, by then part of Boston, in 1909. He was buried at [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in [[Jamaica Plain]], Suffolk County, Massachusetts. A life-size likeness in bronze statue memorializing the man and his works stands in the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston Public Garden]].&lt;ref name="Edward Everett Hale2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/edward-hale/ |author=C.D.

Combining a forceful personality, organizing genius, and liberal practical [[theology]], Hale was active in raising the tone of American life for half a century. He had a deep interest in the anti-[[slavery]] movement (especially in Kansas), as well as popular education (involving himself especially with the [[Chautauqua|Chautauqua adult-education movement]]), and the working-man's home.

He published a wide variety of works in fiction, history and biography. He used his writings and the two magazines he founded, ''Old and New'' (1870–75) and ''Lend a Hand'' (1886–97), to advance a number of social reforms, including religious tolerance, the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and wider education. Writer-educator Mary Lowe Dickinson served as Hale's associate editor for ''Lend a Hand''.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, William A. ”[https://archive.org/stream/fitchburgmassach00emer#page/n129/search/Lowe Mary Caroline Dickinson]”, in ''Fitchburg Massachusetts, Past and Present'', pp. 101-105. Fitchburg, Massachusetts: Press of Blanchard &amp; Brown, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale supported Irish immigration in the mid-19th century, as he felt the new workers freed Americans from performing menial, hard labor. In a series of letters in the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'', he noted the "inferiority" of immigrants: "[it] compels them to go the bottom; and the consequence is that we are, all of us, the higher lifted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Edward Everett|title=Letters on Irish emigration|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:DIV.LIB:910941?n=56|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=6 February 2011|location=Andover-Harvard Theological Library|page=54|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Everett Hale's story “[[The Man Without a Country]]" (1863) opened with the sentence: “I was stranded at the old [[Mission House (Mackinac Island)|Mission House]] in Mackinaw, waiting for a Lake Superior steamer which did not choose to come.” In his 1893 and 1900 reminiscences, E.E. Hale states that ‘To write the story of “The Man Without a Country” and its sequel, “Philip Nolan’s Friends,” I had to make as careful a study as I could of the history of the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States.’&lt;ref&gt;Edward Everett Hale, ''The Works of Edward Everett Hale, a New England Boyhood,'' Volume VI, Second Edition, p. 338.  Boston: Little Brown, and Company, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice.

==Religious demography==
{{Main|Religion in Angola}}
The country has a total area of {{convert|481351|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, and its population of 19 million. [[Christianity]] is the religion of the vast majority of the population, with [[Catholicism]] as the largest single religious group. The Catholic Church estimates that 55 percent of the population is Catholic. Data from the National Institute for Religious Affairs (INAR), under the Ministry of Culture, indicate the major [[Protestant]] traditions, including the [[Methodist]]s, [[Baptists]], [[Congregationalist]]s (United Church of Christ), and [[Assemblies of God]], are present in the country but are declining in strength, with an estimated membership of 10 percent of the population. African Christian denominations are gaining membership and 25 percent of the population are believed to be followers. Five percent are believed to belong to the various [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches, some of them of Brazilian origin. A small portion of the rural population practices [[animism]] or traditional indigenous religions. There is also a small [[Muslim]] community, estimated at 80-90,000 adherents, composed largely of migrants from [[West Africa]] and families of Lebanese extraction. There are few declared [[atheist]]s in the country. Traditional African religions are adhered to by a few peripheral rural societies only, but some traditional beliefs are held by many people.

Foreign missionaries have operated freely throughout the country since independence. During the last colonial decades, Protestant missionaries have sometimes been subject to certain limitations.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors.

The Government requires religious groups to petition for legal status with the Ministries of Justice and Culture. Legal status gives religious groups the right to act as juridical persons in the court system, secures their standing as officially registered religious groups, and allows them to construct schools and churches. Groups must provide general background information and have at least 100,000 adult adherents to qualify for registration.

The Christian holy days of [[Christmas]] and [[Good Friday]] are national holidays with no negative impact on other religious groups.

Public schools do not require religious instruction. The Government permits religious organizations and missions with legal status to establish and operate schools.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.

The Ministries of Justice and Culture currently recognize 85 denominations. More than 800 other religious organizations, many of which are Congolese- or Brazilian-based Christian evangelical groups, have registration applications pending with INAR. They do not meet the membership requirement of at least 100,000 members and are not eligible to receive legal status, but the Government has not barred their activity. INAR reported that the Muslim community, represented by the [[Central Mosque of Luanda]], was close to meeting the registration requirements and was soon expected to gain official legal status.

Members of the clergy regularly use their pulpits to criticize government policies, though church leaders report self-censorship regarding particularly sensitive issues. The Catholic Church-owned [[Radio Ecclesia]] is broadcast in [[Luanda Province]] and frequently hosted spirited debates that spanned the political spectrum and were at times quite critical of government policies. The Media Law, however, requires nonpublic radio networks to have a physical presence in a province to broadcast there. Due to its limited financial capacity, this requirement affects Radio Ecclesia's ability to expand outside of Luanda.

The Government banned 17 religious groups in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] on charges of practicing harmful exorcism rituals on adults and children accused of "witchcraft," illegally holding religious services in residences, and not being registered. Although the law does not recognize the existence of witchcraft, abusive actions committed while practicing a religion are illegal. Members of these groups were not [[Harassment|harassed]], but two leaders were convicted in 2006 of child abuse and sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements and positive developments in respect for religious freedom===
Angola is the only country in the world that does not recognize Islam as a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In February 2006 the Government closed three mosques for holding services that authorities claimed disrupted public order by impeding the flow of traffic. Local Muslim leaders worked with INAR to negotiate an agreement which allowed all mosques to reopen by December 2006.

The Catholic Church confirmed that the Government agreed to fund the construction of schools and churches in restitution for property seized during the [[Angolan civil war]].

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

Although public attitudes toward Islam were generally negative, cultural differences between Angolan and Muslim West African immigrants were generally cited as the basis for negative views toward Islam, rather than religious intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rettig |first=Haviv |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/angola-denies-it-banned-islam-but-concedes-that-it-is-not-legally-recognized/ |title=Angola denies claims it 'banned' Islam |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/11/angola-denies-reports-banning-islam-2013112782236279392.html |title=Angola denies it has banned Islam |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/afrika-angola-geht-gegen-islam-vor-und-schliesst-moscheen-a-935788.html |title=Afrika: Angola geht gegen Islam vor und schließt Moscheen - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, Islam is a very minor issue in Angola, because of the extremely small proportion of Muslims in the country as well as in all neighbouring countries.

Governmental agencies, church groups, and civil society organizations continued campaigns against traditional religions that involve shamans, employ animal sacrifices, or were identified as practicing "witchcraft." The focus of these various programs was on abusive practices that can sometimes stem from traditional indigenous religious groups, not campaigns against witchcraft overall. Various government agencies held workshops and seminars on [[child abuse]] while church-related organizations focused on the doctrinal issues related to such practices as [[animal sacrifice]]s or the use of shamans. There were periodic reports of child and [[elder abuse]] stemming from accusations of "witchcraft," generally in rural areas and smaller cities. In some instances these accusations led to [[exorcism]] rituals that included willful neglect and physical abuse. In some cases deaths have been reported. Current cases remained under investigation; however, in the past authorities have arrested and prosecuted those who have abused, injured, or reportedly killed others accused of "witchcraft."

{{Vaishnavism}} 
'''Gopala Bhatta Goswami''' (1503–1578) is one of the foremost disciples of the [[Vaishnava]] [[saint]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], and a leading historical figure in the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] school of [[Hinduism]]. He was part of a group of Vaishnava devotees known collectively as the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavan]], who were influential in establishing the philosophical basis of the Gaudiya tradition in formalised writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gopala Bhatta Goswami |work=Gaudiya History |url=http://gaudiyahistory.com/sri-gopala-bhatta-goswami/ |accessdate=2014-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014230114/http://gaudiyahistory.com/sri-gopala-bhatta-goswami/ |archivedate=14 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Born in a [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri vaishnava]] family of  Tamil Iyengar origin in  [[Srirangam|sri rangam]],Gopala bhatta goswami was a great devotee of Laxmi-Narayana.According to biographies such as the ''Bhakti Ratnakara'' Gopal Bhatta's first meeting with Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in 1510 during Mahaprabhu's tour of South India. Although of a young age he was given the opportunity to meet with Chaitanya and serve him over a number of months. Such was his love for the saint, that when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was about to leave, Gopala Bhatta became upset, and for Gopala Bhatta's sake, Chaitanya then agreed to stay a few more days.

According to Gaudiya tradition it was during this time that Gopala Bhatta had a spiritual vision in which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu revealed Himself as an avatar of [[Krishna]], the supreme God. In the vision Krishna then told him that in the town of [[Vrindavan]] he would meet with two devotees, namely [[Rupa Goswami]] and [[Sanatana Goswami]] who would instruct him in the finer details of devotional service ([[bhakti]]).

When Gopala Bhatta awoke from the experience, he wanted to leave for Vrindavan at once, however Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told him to stay and serve his parents. After Chaitanya's departure, Gopal Bhatta took guidance from his uncle [[Prabhodananda Sarasvati]]. Gopal Bhatta took care of his parents into their old age, and then after they died he then traveled to Vrindavana. There he met Rupa and Sanatana who accepted him as a brother. Gopal Bhatta later helped Sanatana compile the book ''Hari Bhakti Vilasa''.

==Vrindavan==
[[File:Radha Raman Temple, Vrindavan.jpg|thumb|200px|Radha Raman Temple, Vrindavan established by Gopala Bhatta Goswami in 1542.]]
Gopala Bhatta studied rhetoric, poetry, [[Vedanta]], and [[Sanskrit]] grammar from his uncle Prabodhananda Sarasvati. After the passing of his parents he went to Vrindavan, where he met both Rupa and Sanatana Goswamis as had purportedly been instructed in his vision.

When Lord Chaitanya discovered that Gopala Bhatta was in Vrindavan, he was extremely pleased and sent some of his personal belongings to Gopala Bhatta, who worshiped them. Mahaprabhu also sent a letter instructing Gopala Bhatta to help Rupa and Sanatana compile Vaishnava literature. Gopala Bhatta accepted this instruction as his life and soul, and he later also engaged his disciple Srinivasa Acarya in carrying the writings to Bengal. Gopala Bhatta established the [[Radha Raman Temple]] in [[Vrindavan]] in 1542, his samadhi also exists within the temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propertyinvrindavan.co.in/attractions/radha-ramana-temple/ Property Vrindavan - Radha Ramana Temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18238">The '''Greek Magical Papyri''' (Latin '''''Papyri Graecae Magicae''''', abbreviated '''''PGM''''') is the name given by scholars to a body of [[papyrus|papyri]] from Graeco-Roman Egypt, which each contain a number of [[Ancient_Egyptian_religion#Ritual_and_magical_texts|magical spells, formulae, hymns, and rituals]]. The materials in the papyri date from the 100s BC to the 400s AD.&lt;ref name=betz_intro&gt;Hans Dieter Betz (ed), ''The Greek Magical Papyri in translation'', University of Chicago Press, 1985, p.xli.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts came to light through the antiquities trade, from the 1700s onward. One of the best known of these texts is the [[Mithras Liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA116 Witches, Druids and King Arthur], 2006, p.116: "The most famous of these texts is the so-called Mithras liturgy...".&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts were published in a series, and individual texts are referenced using the abbreviation ''PGM'' plus the volume and item number. Each volume contains a number of spells and rituals.  Further discoveries of similar texts from elsewhere have been allocated PGM numbers for convenience.&lt;ref name=betz_intro /&gt;

==History==

=== Production ===
The corpus of the ''PGM'' were not based on an ancient archive, but rather are a modern collection that has been added to over time. The unclear circumstances of each text's production, over a span of centuries, have therefore occasioned some debate. Betz, the English translator of the ''PGM'', claims that the texts form a fraction of the "magical books" that must have existed in antiquity, and considers them a form of "underground literature" subject to book-burnings at the time. He cites book-burning in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 19:10), [[Augustus]]' orders to burn magical books according to [[Suetonius]] (Suet. ''Aug''. 31.1), and what he terms "numerous" early Christian book-burnings.&lt;ref name="betz_intro" /&gt;

Frankfurter, on the other hand, considers these texts productions of "innovative members of the Egyptian priesthood during the third-/fourth-century decline of the Egyptian temple infrastructure," and lends them considerably less "underground" status than Betz.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, David. 1997. Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of the Category ‘Magician’. In ''Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium'', edited by Peter Schäfer and Hans G. Kippenberg, 115–135. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Segal goes further, using the ''PGM'' to question the dichotomy of magic and religion in scholarship on the Hellenistic world. He uses the existence of hymns in the ''PGM'' to suggest that the people who wrote them in such 'magical' texts saw no distinction between such material and the more overtly magical content in the same documents.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Alan F. 1981. Hellenistic Magic: Some Questions of Definition. In ''Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions Presented to Gilles Quispel on the Occasion of his 65th Birthday'', edited by M. J. Vermaseren and Roel B. Broek, 349–375. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Just how "underground" the practitioners that produced these texts were therefore remains contested, though Betz points to the admonitions to secrecy about the details of certain practices in certain of the papyri. 

=== Discovery ===
The first papyri in the series appeared on the art market in Egypt in the early 19th century. Another papyrus (PGM III) was acquired by the diplomat [[Jean-François Mimaut]] (1774 - 1837) and ended up in the French Bibliothèque Nationale.&lt;ref name=betz_intro /&gt; The major portion of the collection is the so-called Anastasi collection. About half a dozen of the papyri were purchased in about 1827 by a man calling himself [[Giovanni Anastasi (merchant)|Jean d'Anastasi]], who may have been Armenian, and was a diplomatic representative at the Khedivial court in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowden|first=Garth|title=The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1986|isbn=0-521-32583-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that he obtained them at Thebes (modern [[Luxor]]), and he sold them to various major European collections, including the [[British Museum]], the Louvre, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, and the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in Leiden. H. D. Betz, who edited a translation of the collection, states that these pieces probably came from the library of an ancient scholar and collector of late antiquity based in [[Thebes, Egypt]]. Anastasi acquired a great number of other papyri and antiquities as well.&lt;ref name=betz_intro /&gt; The "Thebes Cache" also contained the [[Stockholm papyrus]], and [[Leyden papyrus X]] which contains alchemical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Pam O|title=Openness Secrecy Authorship: Technical Arts and the Culture of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Renaissance|publisher=JHU Press|year=2004|isbn=9780801866067|quote = {{ISBN|0-8018-6606-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar individual, known as ''he who appeared in Thebes'', [[Khaemweset|Prince Khamwas]], was the fourth son of [[Ramesses II|King Ramses II]] and high priest of [[Ptah]] in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. According to Miriam Lichtheim:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miriam Lichtheim|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature Vol III|url=https://archive.org/stream/MiriamLichtheimAncientEgyptianLiteratureVolIII/Miriam%20Lichtheim%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20Literature%20Vol%20III#page/n67/mode/2up/search/prince+Khamwas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Here I should like to stress that Prince Setne Khamwas, the hero of the two tales named for him, was a passionate antiquarian. The historical prince Khamwas, the fourth son of Ramses II, had been high priest of Ptah at Memphis and administrator of all the Memphite sanctuaries. In that capacity he had examined decayed tombs, restored the names of their owners, and renewed their funerary cults. Posterity had transmitted his renown, and the Demotic tales that were spun around his memory depicted him and his fictional adversary Prince [[Naneferkaptah]] as very learned scribes and magicians devoted to the study of ancient monuments and writings.}}

===Publication===
PGM XII and XIII were the first to be published, appearing in 1843 in Greek and in a Latin translation in 1885.&lt;ref name=betz_intro /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Leemans, ''Papyri graeci musei antiquarii publici Lugduni-Batavi'', 2 vols. Brill: 1843, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Betz 1992, the first scholarly publication has been credited to the British scholar [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] (1817-1878), who published for the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]], one PGM V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1|author=Hans Dieter Betz|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century Karl Preisendanz collected the texts and published them in two volumes in 1928 and 1931. A projected third volume, containing new texts and indices, reached the stage of galley proofs dated "Pentecost 1941", but the type was destroyed during the bombing of [[Leipzig]] in the [[Second World War]]. However, photocopies of the proofs circulated among scholars.  A revised and expanded edition of the texts was published in 1973-4 in two volumes.  Volume 1 was a corrected version of the first edition volume 1, but volume 2 was entirely revised and the papyri originally planned for vol. III were included. The indexes were omitted, however.&lt;ref name=betz_intro /&gt;  An English translation of Preisendanz's edited papyri, along with some additional Greek and Demotic texts, was produced in the 1980s by Hans Dieter Betz.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt; 

The PGM can now be searched in the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]] database and various concordances and dictionaries have been published.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The most recent addition was the book Abrasax, published by Nephilim Press in 2012.

==Content==
Betz observes, in the introduction to his translations, that while the papyri were produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], they contain many sections that are Greek in origin and nature. He notes how [[Zeus]], [[Hermes]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], and [[Aphrodite]], among others, are portrayed not as Hellenic or Hellenised aristocrats, as in contemporary literature, but as demonic or even dangerous, much like in Greek folklore.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in translation|last=Betz|first=Hans Dieter (ed.)|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=xlv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Betz also emphasizes the amount of [[syncretism]] he sees in the papyri, especially between Greek, Jewish and Egyptian beliefs. Betz noted, "In this [[syncretism]], the indigenous ancient Egyptian religion has in part survived, in part been profoundly [[hellenized]]. In its Hellenistic transformation, the Egyptian religion of the pre-Hellenistic era appears to have been reduced and simplified, no doubt to facilitate its assimilation into Hellenistic religion as the predominant cultural reference. It is quite clear that the magicians who wrote and used the Greek papyri were Hellenistic in outlook. Hellenization, however, also includes the egyptianizing of Greek religious traditions. The Greek magical papyri contain many instances of such egyptianizing transformations, which take very different forms in different texts or layers of tradition. Again, working out the more exact nature of this religious and cultural interaction remains the task of future research."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is equally undecided about the sources of the Jewish elements within the papyri, declaring that "the origin and nature of the sections representing Jewish magic in the Grcek magical papyri is far from clear."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he concludes that the syncretistic elements within the papyri were a relatively unified approach, best understood as "a Greco-Egyptian, rather than more general Greco-Roman, syncretism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in translation|last=Betz|first=Hans Dieter (ed.)|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=xliv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that [[Albrecht Dieterich]] noted the importance of the Greek Magical Papyri for the study of ancient religions, because most of the texts combine multiple religions: Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, and/or others.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt;

[[Janet H. Johnson]] noted in 1996 that the texts can only be understood entirely when the parts written in the Egyptian language known as "[[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]]" are accounted for. Johnson adds, "All four of the Demotic magical texts appear to have come from the collections that Anastasi gathered in the Theban area. Most have passages in Greek as well as in Demotic, and most have words glossed into Old Coptic (Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet [which indicated vowels, which Egyptian scripts did not] supplemented by extra signs taken from the Demotic for sounds not found in Greek); some contain passages written in the earlier Egyptian hieratic script or words written in a special "[[Cryptography|cipher]]" script, which would have been an effective secret code to a Greek reader but would have been deciphered fairly simply by an Egyptian."&lt;ref name="Betz"/&gt; 

Many of these pieces of papyrus are pages or fragmentary extracts from spell books, repositories of arcane knowledge and mystical secrets. As far as they have been reconstructed, these books appear to fall into two broad categories: some are compilations of spells and magical writings, gathered by scholarly collectors either out of academic interest or for some kind of study of magic; others may have been the working manuals of travelling magicians, containing their repertoire of spells, formulae for all occasions. These often poorly educated magic-users were more like showmen than the traditional Egyptian wizards, who were a highly educated and respected priestly elite. The pages contain spells, recipes, formulae, and prayers, interspersed with magic words and often in shorthand, with abbreviations for the more common formulae. These spells range from impressive and mystical summonings of dark gods and daemons, to folk remedies and even parlor tricks; from portentous, fatal curses, to love charms, and cures for impotence and minor medical complaints.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In many cases the formulaic words and phrases are strikingly similar to those found in [[defixiones]] ([[curse tablet]]s or binding spells, κατάδεσμοι in Greek), such as those we find inscribed on [[ostraka]], [[amulets]], and lead tablets. Since some of these defixiones date from as early as the 500s BCE, and have been found as far afield as Athens, Asia Minor, Rome, and Sicily (as well as Egypt), this provides a degree of continuity, and suggests that some observations based on the PGM will not be altogether inapplicable to the study of the wider Greco-Roman world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Throughout the spells found in the Greek Magical Papyri, there are numerous references to figurines.  They are found in various types of spells, including judicial, erotic, and just standard cursing that one might associate with Haitian voodoo (“Vodou”). The figurines are made of various materials, which usually correspond to the type of spell. Such figurines have been found throughout the Mediterranean basin, usually in places that the ancient Greeks associated with the underworld: graves, sanctuaries, and bodies of water, all of which stress the border between life and death, which is a common theme in greek magic. Some have been discovered in lead coffins, upon which the spell or curse has been inscribed.

===Religion in Greco-Roman Egypt===
{{See also|Magic in the Graeco-Roman world}}
The religion of the Papyri Graecae Magicae is an elaborate [[syncretism]] of Greek, Egyptian, Jewish (see [[Jewish magical papyri]]), and even Babylonian and Christian religious influences engendered by the unique milieu of Greco-Roman Egypt. This syncretism is evident in the Papyri in a variety of ways. Often the Olympians are given attributes of their Egyptian counterparts; alternatively this could be seen as Egyptian deities being referred to by Greek names.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  For example, [[Aphrodite]] (who was associated with the Egyptian [[Hathor]]), is given the epithet Neferihri—from the Egyptian Nfr-iry.t, "nice eyes" (PGM IV. 1266).

Within this profusion of cultural influences can still be seen classical Greek material, and perhaps even aspects of a more accessible "folk-religion" than those preserved in the mainstream literary texts.{{Dubious|date=September 2008}} Sometimes the Greek gods depart from their traditional Olympian natures familiar to classicists, and seem far more chthonic, demonic and bestial. This is partly the influence of Egyptian religion, in which beast cult and the terror of the divine were familiar elements; equally the context of magical texts makes such sinister deities appropriate.&lt;ref name="welde"&gt;"The Esoteric Codex: Ancient Egyptian Texts I" by Christopher Welde, (LULU Press) 2015 p92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Cutner''' (1881–1969) was an English artist, [[Etching|etcher]] and [[freethought]] writer.

==Biography==

Cutner was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. He was educated at the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://originalscottishart.com/artist/herbert-cutner/ "Herbert Cutner"]. William Shannon Fine Art.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]] (1916–1919) he served as a Private in the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name= "Schmalhausen 1931"&gt;Schmalhausen, Samuel Daniel; Calverton, Victor Francis. (1931). ''Woman's Coming of Age: A Symposium''. H. Liveright, Inc. p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an etcher and his works can be found in the [[British Museum]] and at exhibitions.&lt;ref name= "Schmalhausen 1931"/&gt; He was married to artist Effie Spring-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suffolkpainters.co.uk/index.cgi?choice=painter&amp;pid=786 "Effie Spring-Smith (1907–1974)"]. Suffolk Painters.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his etchings have been recorded in fine prints.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Guichard. (1977). ''British Etchers 1850–1940''. Garton. p. 34. {{ISBN|978-0906030004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutner was a Jewish [[Atheism|atheist]] and had praised the works of [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Salonon, Sidney. (1939). ''The Jews of Britain''. Hutchinson &amp; Company. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Levy|Levy, Leonard W]]. (1995). ''Blasphemy: Verbal Offense Against the Sacred, From Moses to Salman Rushdie''. University of North Carolina Press. p. 641. {{ISBN|978-0807845158}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a "freethought scholar".&lt;ref&gt;[[Madalyn Murray O'Hair|O'Hair, Madalyn Murray]]. (1972). ''What on Earth Is an Atheist!'' Ayer Company Publishers. p. 247. {{ISBN|978-0405038020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was a regular contributor to the ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|Freethinker]]'' and known for debating controversial topics. [[Jim Herrick]] has written that Cutner was a "controversialist with somewhat right-wing views."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Herrick|Herrick, Jim]]. (1982). ''Vision and Realism: A Hundred Years of the Freethinker''. G. W. Foote &amp; Co Ltd. p. 99, p. 106. {{ISBN|978-0950824307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Vice-President of the Thomas Paine Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomaspaineuk.com/upload/1969%20-%20TPS%20Bulletin%20-%20Vol%203%20-%20No%203.pdf "Bulletin of the Thomas Paine Society"]. No. 3. Vol 3. Spring, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the introduction to [[George William Foote|G. W. Foote]]'s ''Defence of Free Speech'', 1932. 

==Christ myth theory==

Cutner was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]] and is best known for his book ''Jesus: God, Man, or Myth?'', 1950. [[George H. Smith]] has described it as an "excellent defense of the mythicist thesis".&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Smith|Smith, George H]]. (1991). ''Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies''. Prometheus Books. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0879755775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutner once debated [[Archibald Robertson (atheist)|Archibald Robertson]] on the historicity of Jesus at [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex Hall]]. Robertson later negatively reviewed Cutner's book in ''[[The Literary Guide and Rationalist Review]]''. In response, he attacked Robertson's ''Origins of Christianity'' in the ''[[Truth Seeker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald Robertson (atheist)|Robertson, Archibald]]. (1959). ''Religion, Socialism, and Views of Men and Events: Connected With the Movement of Social Struggle, Stated in Eight Letters to the Editor''. ''The Word, Volumes 21–25''. Strickland Press.  pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">'''Hinduism in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]''' is mainly represented by the [[Hare Krishna movement]] ([[ISKCON]]) and the [[Sathya Sai Baba]] Organisation.  ISKCON and the Satya Sai Baba-Centre have been registered in the Republic of Macedonia as a part of the Oriental religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/facta/pas/pas99/pas99-10.pdf facta.junis.ni.ac.rs pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hare Krishna in Macedonia==

[[ISKCON]] is a legally registered and recognized as a religious minority in Macedonia. The main center is located in [[Skopje]], Ul:31 Br:33, nas. Volkovo, 1000 Skopje, with sympathizers throughout the country. Its first center was opened in 1988. Local members are frequently visited by devotees from other [[former Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav]] countries, who are considerably larger in number.

In Macedonia, governments regularly invite Hare Krishna devotees whenever there is an occasion for various religious bodies to meet together. The deceased President [[Boris Trajkovski|Trajkovski]] invited members each time he met with leaders from other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14332&amp;sec=59&amp;con=41 WWRNews]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sathya Sai Baba Organisation in Macedonia==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
The [[Sathya Sai Baba]] Organisation is a legally registered and recognized as a religious minority in Macedonia. The Macedonian Sathya Sai movement, much like the Hare Krishna devotees, has its roots at the end of the 1980s. At that time a group in [[Skopje]] was formed spontaneously. Now the Sathya Sai Organization has three centres in Skopje. There is a smaller group in [[Štip]], and a sizable number of sympathizers in the rest of the country.

Islam is the religion of about '''1 percent''' of the population of Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51503.htm|title=Zimbabwe|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|quote="An estimated 1 percent of the total population is Muslim."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim community consists primarily of South Asian immigrants (Indian and Pakistani), a small number of indigenous Zimbabweans, and a very small number of North African and Middle Eastern immigrants. There are mosques located in nearly all of the larger towns.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Estimates on the number of Muslims in Zimbabwe is '''1.2 Million''', according to the Agnes Chiwara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voazimbabwe.com/a/zimbabwe-islam-muslims-ramadan-and-muslim-culture/1963526.html|title=Is Islam Spreading in Zimbabwe?|last=Chifera|first=Irwin|work=VOA|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been sayings amongst muslims that Arab traders have played a significant role in the construction of [[Great Zimbabwe]], similarly to their role in neighboring Northern [[Mozambique]]. They point to the indigenous tribe of Varemba/Lemba which mostly resides Masvingo and Mberengwa who retain several common points with Abrahamic faiths. Although a small proportion practice Islam, the majority identify themselves as the "black jews of Zimbabwe".   

A great number of Muslims have also arrived since the discovery of diamonds in the Manicaland area from North and Western African regions.
The Islamic migrants are otherwise largely coming from the [[WaYao|Yao]] tribe of neighboring [[Malawi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1334">'''Jewish thought''' ({{lang-he|מחשבת ישראל}}), also known as '''Judaic thought''' or '''Hebraic thought''', is a field of [[Jewish studies]] that deals with the products of Jewish thought and culture throughout the ages, and their historical development. The field also deals with the connections, parallels, and influences, between Jewish ways of thought and world philosophy in general.

The term "Jewish thought" was originally suggested by [[Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook]], within the framework of the founding of his central Israeli [[yeshiva]], [[Mercaz HaRav Kook|Mercaz HaRav]]. Jewish thought became a standard field in yeshiva studies in [[Israel]], and the Israeli ministry of education recognized it as a "profession" - a course of study which can result in a formal educational degree.

Jewish thought became a formal department in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] when the two departments of "Jewish Philosophy and Kabbalah", and "The History of Jewish Thought" were merged, and augmented by the addition of "Ethical Literature" to the department. Today the field of Jewish thought is a recognized field of study throughout Israeli yeshivas and universities.

'''John Valentine Dittemore''' (September 30, 1876 - May 10, 1937) was an American biographer and writer. He was a director of [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], the [[Christian Science]] church, in Boston from 1909 until 1919. Before that he was head of the church's Committee on Publication in New York, and a trustee for ten years of the estate of [[Mary Baker Eddy]] (1821–1910), the founder of Christian Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gabriel|first1=Ralph H.|title=''Mary Baker Eddy, the Truth and the Tradition'' by Ernest Sutherland Bates; John V. Dittemore|journal=The New England Quarterly|date=March 1933|volume=6|issue=1|pages=(200–202), 200|jstor=359379|ref=harv|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dittemore is best known as the co-author, with [[Ernest Sutherland Bates]], of ''Mary Baker Eddy, the Truth and the Tradition'' (1932). Historian Ralph Henry Gabriel wrote in 1933 that, because of the amount of primary-source material to which Dittemore had access, the book "comes very close to being a definitive history of a strangely paradoxical woman".{{sfn|Gabriel|1933|loc=202}}

==Background==

Dittemore was born in [[Indianapolis]]. He attended [[Ohio Military Institute]] and [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy Andover]]. He was president of the Federal Packing Company and Vice-President of [[Van Camp's|Van Camp Packing Company]].&lt;ref name="Thompson 1974"&gt;Thompson, Donald Eugene. (1974). [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/inauthors/view?docId=encyclopedia/VAA5365-02.xml;chunk.id=ina-v2-entry-0673;toc.depth=100;toc.id=ina-v2-entry-0673;brand=ia-books;doc.view=0;query=&amp;text1=ollah&amp;field1=text&amp;hit.rank= ''Indiana Authors and Their Books 1917-1966'']. Wabash College. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; He married Edith L. Bingham in 1898, they had one daughter, Louise.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1974"/&gt;

As head of the Christian Science church's Committee on Publication, Dittemore commissioned the first church-authorized biography of Eddy, ''The Life of Mary Baker Eddy'' (1907) by [[Sibyl Wilbur]], which he later said was unreliable. Over the next 20 years he collected primary-source material about the church and Eddy. As his research progressed, he began to find material, including thousands of letters Eddy had written, that in his view contradicted the church's account of its own history and Eddy's life. The church at first supported his research, then tried to dissuade him from continuing with it.&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv&gt;''Truth and the Tradition'', iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became disillusioned with the church after coming to the view in 1928 that Eddy's work, much of it in the religion's textbook ''Science and Health'' (1875), had borrowed heavily from the unpublished manuscripts of New England "mental healer" [[Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]] (1802–1866). He was also concerned that the church had attempted to boycott [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] for publishing a critical biography of Eddy, [[Edwin Franden Dakin|Edwin Dakin]]'s ''Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind'' (1929).&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv/&gt;{{sfn|Gabriel|1933|loc=202}} The publisher took out an ad in the ''Los Angeles Times'' in December 1929 saying that booksellers across America were returning Dakin's book under pressure. It said: "The result is a situation almost incredible in a free country."&lt;ref&gt;Duffield, William (20 December 1929). "''Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind''", letter to the editor, ''California and Western Medicine'', 20 December 1929. {{PMC|1657341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mary Baker Eddy, the Truth and the Tradition''{{anchor|Truth and the Tradition}}==
Dittemore went on to write his own biography of Eddy and history of the church, ''Mary Baker Eddy, the Truth and the Tradition'' (1932), with the historian [[Ernest Sutherland Bates]]. That he collaborate with Bates was suggested by [[Allen Johnson (historian)|Allen Johnson]], Professor of American History at Yale University.&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv/&gt;

The book is largely based on three trunks full of primary sources that Dittemore collected, including 1,500 unpublished letters from Eddy; rare excerpts from the diary of Eddy's personal assistant [[Calvin Frye]]; the diary of James F. Gilman, who illustrated her work; letters from her brother and first two husbands; 500 letters from her students; and reminiscences from her close contacts.&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv/&gt; [[Gillian Gill]] writes that Dittemore, on behalf of the church, gained access to Frye's rooms after his death and removed sections of his diary, which Vittemore transcribed, photographed, then burned. He included extracts in his book.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Gillian (1998). ''Mary Baker Eddy'', Perseus Books, 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also makes use of two books that Dittemore writes were suppressed by the church: ''Mrs. Eddy as I Knew Her in 1870'' (1923) by [[Samuel Putnam Bancroft]], a student of Eddy's, and ''Mrs. Eddy and the Late Suit in Equity'' (1908) by Michael Meehan. The latter is about a lawsuit Eddy was involved in toward the end of her life, in which her relatives sought unsuccessfully to have her declared unable to manage her affairs.&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv/&gt; Meehan was a supporter of Eddy's, and she initially approved the publication but later asked the author not to release it.&lt;ref name=Vittemorepiv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, Michael (1908). [https://archive.org/details/mrseddyandlates00meehgoog ''Mrs. Eddy and the Late Suit in Equity'']. Concord, NH. Another edition is entitled ''Mrs. Eddy and Next Friends''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the church had suppressed other works critical of Eddy, it also suppressed the ''Truth and the Tradition'' by buying the copyright and publisher's plates from A. A. Knopf.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, Charles S. (1958). ''Christian Science Today: Power, Policy, Practice'', Southern Methodist University Press, 384–385, cited in Gill 1998, 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between [[God in Judaism|God]], the unchanging, eternal, and mysterious ''[[Ein Sof]]'' ({{Hebrew|אֵין סוֹף}}, "The Infinite"),&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ein-sof |title=Ein-Sof |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |publisher=[[American–Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|AICE]] |quote='''EIN-SOF''' (Heb. אֵין סוֹף; "The Infinite," lit. that which is boundless), name given in Kabbalah to God transcendent, in His pure essence: God in Himself, apart from His relationship to the created world. Since [[Names of God in Judaism|every name which was given to God]] referred to one of the characteristics or attributes by which He revealed Himself to His creatures, or which they ascribed to Him, there is no name or epithet for God from the point of view of His own being. Consequently, when the kabbalists wanted to be precise in their language they abstained from using names like ''[[Elohim]]'', the [[Tetragrammaton]], "the Holy One, blessed be He," and others. These names are all found either in the [[Torah|Written]] or the [[Talmud|Oral Law]]. The Torah, however, refers only to God's manifestations and not to God's own being which is above and beyond His relationship to the created world. Therefore, neither in the [[Tanakh|Bible]], nor in [[Rabbinic literature| rabbinic tradition]] was there a term which could fulfill the need of the kabbalists in their speculations on the nature of God. "Know that ''Ein-Sof'' is not alluded to either in the Pentateuch, the Prophets, or the Hagiographa, nor in the writings of the rabbis. But the mystics had a vague tradition about it" (''Sefer Ma'arekhet ha-Elohut''). The term ''Ein-Sof'' is found in [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|kabbalistic literature]] after 1200.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morfix.co.il/אינסוף|title=אינסוף|website=Morfix™, ™מורפיקס|publisher=Melingo Ltd|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mortal and finite [[universe]] (God's [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]).&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; It forms the foundation of mystical religious interpretations within Judaism.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReformJudaism"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reformjudaism.org/what-kabbalah |title=What is Kabbalah? |last=Dennis |first=Geoffrey W. |date=18 June 2014 |website=ReformJudaism.org |publisher=[[Union for Reform Judaism]] |access-date=25 October 2018 |quote=[[History of Judaism|Historians of Judaism]] identify many [[Jewish mysticism|schools of Jewish esotericism]] across time, each with its own unique interests and beliefs. Technically, the term “Kabbalah” applies only to writings that emerged in medieval Spain and southern France beginning in the 13th century. [...] Although until today Kabbalah has been the practice of select Jewish “circles,” most of what we know about it comes from the many literary works that have been recognized as “mystical” or “esoteric.” From these mystical works, scholars have identified many distinctive mystical schools, including the [[Hekhalot literature|Hechalot mystics]], the [[Ashkenazi Hasidim|German Pietists]], the [[Zohar|Zoharic Kabbalah]], the [[Jewish meditation#Abraham Abulafia|ecstatic school]] of [[Abraham Abulafia]], the teachings of [[Isaac Luria]], and [[Chasidism]]. These schools can be categorized further based on individual masters and their disciples.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Jewish Kabbalists|Jewish Kabbalists]] originally developed their own transmission of [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|sacred texts]] within the realm of [[Jewish tradition]],&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReformJudaism"/&gt; and often use classical Jewish scriptures to explain and demonstrate its mystical teachings. These teachings are held by followers in Judaism to define the inner meaning of both the [[Hebrew Bible]] and traditional [[rabbinic literature]] and their formerly concealed transmitted dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm "Imbued with Holiness"] - The relationship of the esoteric to the [[exoteric]] in the fourfold [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]] interpretation of [[Torah]] and existence.

According to the ''[[Zohar]]'', a foundational text for kabbalistic thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://reformjudaism.org/what-kabbalah |last=Dennis |first=Geoffrey W. |title=What is Kabbalah? |date=18 June 2014 |publisher=[[Union for Reform Judaism]] |website=ReformJudaism.org |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torah study]] can proceed along four levels of interpretation ([[exegesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Shnei Luchot HaBrit'', R. Isaiah Horowitz, ''Toldot Adam'', "Beit Ha-Chokhma", 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Broydé |first1=Isaac |author-link1=Isaac Broydé |last2=Jacobs |first2=Joseph |author-link2=Joseph Jacobs |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/15278-zohar |title=Zohar |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Kopelman Foundation]] |date=1906 |access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four levels are called ''[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|pardes]]'' from their initial letters (PRDS {{lang-he|פַּרדֵס|links=no}}, orchard).
* ''[[Peshat]]'' ({{lang-he|פשט|links=no}} lit. "simple"): the direct interpretations of meaning.
* ''Remez'' ({{lang-he|רֶמֶז|links=no}} lit. "hint[s]"): the [[allegory|allegoric]] meanings (through [[allusion]]).
* ''Derash'' ({{lang-he|דְרָשׁ|links=no}} from Heb. ''darash'': "inquire" or "seek"): [[midrash]]ic (rabbinic) meanings, often with imaginative comparisons with similar words or verses.
* ''Sod'' ({{lang-he|סוֹד|links=no}} lit. "secret" or "mystery"): the inner, esoteric ([[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]) meanings, expressed in kabbalah.

Kabbalah is considered by its followers as a necessary part of the study of [[Torah]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the study of Torah (the ''[[Tanakh]]'' and rabbinic literature) being an inherent duty of observant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Written_Law.html |title=The Written Law - Torah |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern academic-historical study of Jewish mysticism reserves the term "kabbalah" to designate the particular, distinctive doctrines that textually emerged fully expressed in the Middle Ages, as distinct from the earlier [[Merkabah mysticism|Merkabah mystical concepts]] and methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A very short introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, Chapters on "the emergence of Medieval Kabbalah" and "doctrines of Medieval Kabbalah"&lt;/ref&gt; According to this descriptive categorisation, both versions of Kabbalistic theory, the medieval-Zoharic and the early-modern [[Lurianic kabbalah]] together comprise the theosophical tradition in Kabbalah, while the meditative-ecstatic Kabbalah incorporates a parallel inter-related Medieval tradition. A third tradition, related but more shunned, involves the magical aims of [[Practical Kabbalah]]. [[Moshe Idel]], for example, writes that these 3 basic models can be discerned operating and competing throughout the whole history of Jewish mysticism, beyond the particular Kabbalistic background of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Idel, '' Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; They can be readily distinguished by their basic intent with respect to God:
* The theosophical tradition of ''Theoretical Kabbalah'' (the main focus of the Zohar and Luria) seeks to understand and describe the divine realm. As an alternative to rationalist Jewish philosophy, particularly Maimonides' Aristotelianism, this speculation became the central component of Kabbalah
* The Ecstatic tradition of ''Meditative Kabbalah'' (exemplified by [[Abraham Abulafia|Abulafia]] and [[Isaac of Acre]]) strives to achieve a mystical union with God. Abraham Abulafia's "Prophetic Kabbalah" was the supreme example of this, though marginal in Kabbalistic development, and his alternative to the program of theosophical Kabbalah
* The Magico-[[theurgical]] tradition of ''Practical Kabbalah'' (in often unpublished manuscripts) endeavours to alter both the Divine realms and the World. While some interpretations of prayer see its role as manipulating heavenly forces, Practical Kabbalah properly involved white-magical acts, and was censored by kabbalists for only those completely pure of intent. Consequently, it formed a separate minor tradition shunned from Kabbalah. Practical Kabbalah was prohibited by the Arizal until the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is rebuilt and the required state of ritual purity is attainable.&lt;ref name="Wyn"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

According to traditional belief, early kabbalistic knowledge was transmitted orally by the Patriarchs, [[Neviim|prophets]], and sages (''hakhamim'' in Hebrew), eventually to be "interwoven" into Jewish religious writings and culture. According to this view, early kabbalah was, in around the 10th century BCE, an open knowledge practiced by over a million people in ancient Israel.&lt;ref&gt;''Megillah 14a, Shir HaShirim Rabbah 4:22, Ruth Rabbah 1:2, Aryeh Kaplan ''Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide'' pp.44–48''&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign conquests drove the Jewish spiritual leadership of the time (the [[Sanhedrin]]) to hide the knowledge and make it secret, fearing that it might be misused if it fell into the wrong hands.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ashlag; ''Preface to the Wisdom of Truth'' p.12 section 30 and p.105 bottom section of the left column as preface to the "Talmud Eser HaSfirot"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to clarify with any degree of certainty the exact concepts within kabbalah. There are several different schools of thought with very different outlooks; however, all are accepted as correct.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Shem Mashmaon'' by Shimon Agasi. It is a commentary on Otzrot Haim by Haim Vital. In the introduction he list five major schools of thought as to how to understand the Haim Vital's understanding of the concept of ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[halakhic]] authorities have tried to narrow the scope and diversity within kabbalah, by restricting study to certain texts, notably Zohar and the teachings of Isaac Luria as passed down through [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Yechveh Daat'' Vol 3, section 47 by Ovadiah Yosef&lt;/ref&gt; However, even this qualification does little to limit the scope of understanding and expression, as included in those works are commentaries on Abulafian writings, ''Sefer Yetzirah'', Albotonian writings, and the ''Berit Menuhah'',&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ktavim Hadashim'' published by Yaakov Hillel of Ahavat Shalom for a sampling of works by Haim Vital attributed to Isaac Luria that deal with other works.&lt;/ref&gt; which is known to the kabbalistic elect and which, as described more recently by [[Gershom Scholem]], combined ecstatic with theosophical mysticism. It is therefore important to bear in mind when discussing things such as the ''[[sephirot]]'' and their interactions that one is dealing with highly abstract concepts that at best can only be understood intuitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=15550 |title=Kabbala goes to yeshiva - Magazine - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish and non-Jewish Kabbalah===
[[File:Portae Lucis, Joseph Gikatilla.jpg|thumb|Latin translation of [[Joseph Gikatilla|Gikatilla's]] ''Shaarei Ora'']]
From the [[Renaissance]] onwards Jewish Kabbalah texts entered non-Jewish culture, where they were studied and translated by [[Christian Hebraists]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] occultists.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press 2007. Chapters: 5 Modern Times-I The Christian Kabbalah, 9 Some Aspects of Contemporary Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; The syncretic traditions of Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah developed independently of Jewish Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universal ancient wisdom. Both adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Judaic understanding, to merge with other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations. With the decline of Christian Cabala in the [[Age of Reason]], Hermetic Qabalah continued as a central underground tradition in [[Western esotericism]]. Through these non-Jewish associations with magic, [[alchemy]] and divination, Kabbalah acquired some popular [[occult]] connotations forbidden within Judaism, where Jewish theurgic Practical Kabbalah was a minor, permitted tradition restricted for a few elite. Today, many publications on Kabbalah belong to the non-Jewish New Age and occult traditions of Cabala, rather than giving an accurate picture of Judaic Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', [[Louis Jacobs]], Oxford University Press 1995. Entry: Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, academic and traditional publications now translate and study Judaic Kabbalah for wide readership.

== History of Jewish mysticism ==
{{Jewish mysticism}}

=== Origins ===
According to the traditional understanding, Kabbalah dates from Eden.&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"&gt;[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]] First Paragraph http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35004&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=7&amp;hilite=&lt;/ref&gt; It came down from a remote past as a revelation to elect [[Tzadikim]] (righteous people), and, for the most part, was preserved only by a privileged few. Talmudic Judaism records its view of the proper protocol for teaching this wisdom, as well as many of its concepts, in the ''[[Talmud]]'', Tractate ''[[Hagigah]]'', 11b-13a, "One should not teach ... the Act of Creation in pairs, nor the Act of the Chariot to an individual, unless he is wise and can understand the implications himself etc."&lt;ref&gt;אין דורשין ... במעשה בראשית בשנים ולא במרכבה ביחיד אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholarship suggests that various schools of Jewish esotericism arose at different periods of Jewish history, each reflecting not only prior forms of [[mysticism]], but also the intellectual and cultural milieu of that historical period. Answers to questions of transmission, lineage, influence, and innovation vary greatly and cannot be easily summarised.

==== Terms ====
Originally, Kabbalistic knowledge was believed to be an integral part of the [[Oral Torah]], given by God to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]] around the 13th century BCE according to its followers; although some believe that Kabbalah began with [[Adam and Eve|Adam]].&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks.org"/&gt;

For a few centuries the esoteric knowledge was referred to by its aspect practice—meditation [[Hitbonenut]] ({{lang-he|הִתְבּוֹנְנוּת}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Meditations/jewishmeditation/Active_vs.Passive_Meditation.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124200908/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Meditations/jewishmeditation/Active_vs.Passive_Meditation.asp |date=January 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]'s [[Hitbodedut]] ({{lang-he|הִתְבּוֹדְדוּת}}), translated as "being alone" or "isolating oneself", or by a different term describing the actual, desired goal of the practice—prophecy ("''NeVu'a''" {{lang-he|נְבוּאָה}}).

During the 5th century BCE, when the works of the Tanakh were edited and canonised and the secret knowledge encrypted within the various writings and scrolls ("Megilot"), the knowledge was referred to as ''Ma'aseh Merkavah'' ({{lang-he|מַעֲשֶׂה מֶרְכָּבָה}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/kabbalah/section1.html |title=The Kaballah: Ma’aseh merkavah |publisher=SparkNotes |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ma'aseh B'reshit'' ({{lang-he|מַעֲשֶׂה בְּרֵאשִׁית}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/kabbalah/section2.rhtml |title=The Kaballah: Ma’aseh bereshit |publisher=SparkNotes |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively "the act of the Chariot" and "the act of Creation". [[Merkabah mysticism]] alluded to the encrypted knowledge within the book of the prophet [[Ezekiel]] describing his vision of the "Divine Chariot". B'reshit mysticism referred to the first chapter of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] ({{lang-he| בְּרֵאשִׁית}}) in the Torah that is believed to contain secrets of the creation of the universe and forces of nature. These terms are also mentioned in the second chapter of the Talmudic tractate ''Hagigah''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Mystic elements of the Torah ====
[[File:Ark of the Covenant 19th-century.png|thumb|left|[[Ezekiel]] and [[Isaiah]] had prophetic visions of the angelic Chariot and Divine Throne.]]
When read by later generations of Kabbalists, the Torah's description of the creation in the Book of Genesis reveals mysteries about God himself, the true nature of Adam and Eve, the [[Garden of Eden]]({{lang-he|גַּן עֵדֶן}}), the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] ({{lang-he|עֵץ הַדַּעַת שֶׁל טוֹב וְרַע}}), and the [[Tree of Life]] ({{lang-he|עֵץ חַיִּים}}),  as well as the interaction of these supernatural entities with the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]  ({{lang-he|נָחָשׁ}}), which leads to disaster when they eat the [[forbidden fruit]] ({{lang-he|פְּרִי עֵץ הַדַּעַת}}), as recorded in Genesis 3.&lt;ref name="Artson"&gt;[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2 Artson, Bradley Shavit]. ''From the Periphery to the Centre: Kabbalah and the Conservative Movement'', United Synagogue Review, Spring 2005, Vol. 57 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides ample additional material for mythic and mystical speculation. The prophet Ezekiel's visions in particular attracted much mystical speculation, as did Isaiah's Temple vision—''Isaiah'', Ch.6. [[Jacob]]'s vision of the [[Jacob's Ladder (Bible)|ladder to heaven]] provided another example of esoteric experience. Moses' encounters with the [[Burning bush]] and God on Mount Sinai are evidence of mystical events in the Torah that form the origin of Jewish mystical beliefs.

The [[Shemhamphorasch|72 letter name of God]] which is used in Jewish mysticism for meditation purposes is derived from the Hebrew verbal utterance Moses spoke in the presence of an angel, while the [[Sea of Reeds]] parted, allowing the Hebrews to escape their approaching attackers. The miracle of the Exodus, which led to Moses receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] and the Jewish Orthodox view of the acceptance of the Torah at Mount Sinai, preceded the creation of the first Jewish nation approximately three hundred years before [[Saul the King|King Saul]].

=== Talmudic era ===
[[File:Akivakever.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Grave of [[Rabbi Akiva]] in [[Tiberias]]. He features in Hekhalot mystical literature, and as one of the four who entered the [[Pardes (legend)|Pardes]]]]
[[File:The grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai2 (before 1899).jpg|thumb|The grave of [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] before 1899. A Talmudic [[Tannaim|Tanna]], he is the mystical teacher in the central Kabbalistic work, the Zohar]]
In early [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE), the terms ''Ma'aseh Bereshit'' ("Works of Creation") and ''Ma'aseh Merkabah'' ("Works of the Divine Throne/Chariot") clearly indicate the [[Midrash]]ic nature of these speculations; they are really based upon Genesis 1 and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 1:4–28, while the names ''Sitrei Torah'' (Hidden aspects of the Torah) (Talmud ''Hag.'' 13a) and ''Razei Torah'' (Torah secrets) (''Ab.'' vi. 1) indicate their character as secret lore. An additional term also expanded Jewish esoteric knowledge, namely ''Chochmah Nistara'' (Hidden wisdom).

Talmudic doctrine forbade the public teaching of esoteric doctrines and warned of their dangers. In the [[Mishnah]] (Hagigah 2:1), rabbis were warned to teach the mystical creation doctrines only to one student at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Urbach, ''The Sages'', pp.184ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}} To highlight the danger, in one Jewish aggadic ("legendary") anecdote, four prominent rabbis of the Mishnaic period (1st century CE) are said to have visited the Orchard (that is, Paradise, ''pardes'', Hebrew: {{lang|he|פרדס}} lit., ''orchard''):{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
{{quote|Four men entered ''pardes''—Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, ''Acher'' (Elisha ben Abuyah), and Akiba. Ben Azzai looked and died; Ben Zoma looked and went mad; Acher destroyed the plants; Akiba entered in peace and departed in peace.}}

In notable readings of this legend, only Rabbi Akiba was fit to handle the study of mystical doctrines. The ''[[Tosafot]]'', medieval commentaries on the Talmud, say that the four sages "did not go up literally, but it appeared to them as if they went up".&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Streane, ''A Translation of the Treatise Chagigah from the Babylonian Talmud'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1891. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Louis Ginzberg]], writes in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901–1906) that the journey to paradise "is to be taken literally and not allegorically".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Ginzberg, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=296&amp;letter=E Elisha ben Abuyah]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1901–1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides interprets ''pardes'' as physics and not mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Yesodei Torah, Chapters 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=March 2012}}

=== Pre-Kabbalistic schools ===
The mystical methods and doctrines of [[Hekhalot]] (Heavenly "Chambers") and Merkabah (Divine "Chariot") texts, named by modern scholars from these repeated motifs, lasted from the 1st century BCE through to the 10th century, before giving way to the documented manuscript emergence of Kabbalah. Initiates were said to "descend the chariot", possibly a reference to internal introspection on the Heavenly journey through the spiritual realms. The ultimate aim was to arrive before the transcendent awe, rather than nearness, of the Divine. From the 8th to 11th centuries, the Hekhalot texts, and the proto-Kabbalistic early ''Sefer Yetzirah'' ("Book of Creation") made their way into European Jewish circles.

Another, separate influential mystical movement, shortly before the arrival there of Kabbalistic theory, was the "[[Chassidei Ashkenaz]]" (חסידי אשכנז) or Medieval German Pietists from 1150 to 1250. This ethical-ascetic movement arose mostly among a single scholarly family, the [[Kalonymus family]] of the French and German Rhineland.

=== Medieval emergence of the Kabbalah ===
[[File:Nahmanides painting.jpg|thumb|The 13th-century eminence of [[Nachmanides]], a classic rabbinic figure, gave Kabbalah mainstream acceptance through his Torah commentary]]
Modern scholars have identified several mystical brotherhoods that functioned in Europe starting in the 12th century. Some, such as the "Iyyun Circle" and the "Unique Cherub Circle", were truly esoteric, remaining largely anonymous.

There were certain [[Rishonim]] ("Elder Sages") of [[wikt:exoteric|exoteric]] Judaism who are known to have been experts in Kabbalah. One of the best known is [[Nahmanides]] (the ''Ramban'') (1194–1270) whose commentary on the Torah is considered to be based on Kabbalistic knowledge. [[Bahya ben Asher]] (the ''Rabbeinu Behaye'') (died 1340) also combined Torah commentary and Kabbalah. Another was [[Isaac the Blind]] (1160–1235), the teacher of Nahmanides, who is widely argued to have written the first work of classic Kabbalah, the ''[[Bahir]]'' (Book of "Brightness").

Many Orthodox Jews reject the idea that Kabbalah underwent significant historical development or change such as has been proposed above. After the composition known as the Zohar was presented to the public in the 13th century, the term "Kabbalah" began to refer more specifically to teachings derived from, or related to, the ''Zohar''. At an even later time, the term began to generally be applied to Zoharic teachings as elaborated upon by Isaac Luria Arizal. Historians generally date the start of Kabbalah as a major influence in Jewish thought and practice with the publication of the Zohar and climaxing with the spread of the Arizal's teachings. The majority of [[Haredi]] Jews accept the Zohar as the representative of the ''Ma'aseh Merkavah'' and ''Ma'aseh B'reshit'' that are referred to in Talmudic texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Zohar.html |title=The Zohar |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern era: Lurianic Kabbalah ===
[[File:SafedDSCN4077.JPG|thumb|left|The leading scholars of [[Safed]] in 16th-century invigorated mainstream Judaism through new legal, liturgical, exegetical and Lurianic-mythological developments.]]
Following the upheavals and dislocations in the Jewish world as a result of [[anti-Judaism]] during the [[Middle Ages]], and the national trauma of the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, closing the Spanish Jewish flowering, Jews began to search for signs of when the long-awaited [[Jewish Messiah]] would come to comfort them in their painful exiles. In the 16th century, the community of [[Safed]] in the Galilee became the centre of Jewish mystical, exegetical, legal and liturgical developments. The Safed mystics responded to the Spanish expulsion by turning Kabbalistic doctrine and practice towards a messianic focus. [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moses Cordovero]] and his school popularized the teachings of the Zohar which had until then been only a restricted work. Cordovero's comprehensive works achieved the systemisation of preceding Kabbalah. The author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' (the normative Jewish "Code of Law"), [[Yosef Karo]] (1488–1575), was also a scholar of Kabbalah who kept a personal mystical diary. [[Moshe Alshich]] wrote a mystical commentary on the Torah, and [[Shlomo Alkabetz]] wrote Kabbalistic commentaries and poems.

The messianism of the Safed mystics culminated in Kabbalah receiving its biggest transformation in the Jewish world with the explication of its new interpretation from Isaac Luria (1534–1572), by his disciples Hayim Vital and [[Israel Sarug]]. Both transcribed Luria's teachings (in variant forms) gaining them widespread popularity, Sarug taking Lurianic Kabbalah to Europe, Vital authoring the latterly canonical version. Luria's teachings came to rival the influence of the Zohar and Luria stands, alongside Moses de Leon, as the most influential mystic in Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/isaac-luria-kabbalah-in-safed/|title=Isaac Luria &amp; Kabbalah in Safed {{!}} My Jewish Learning|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ban on studying Kabbalah ====
The ban on studying Kabbalah was lifted by the efforts of the 16th-century kabbalist [[Avraham Azulai]] (1570–1643).
{{quote|I have found it written that all that has been decreed Above forbidding open involvement in the Wisdom of Truth [Kabbalah] was [only meant for] the limited time period until the year 5,250 (1490 C.E.). From then on after is called the "Last Generation", and what was forbidden is [now] allowed. And permission is granted to occupy ourselves in the [study of] Zohar. And from the year 5,300 (1540 C.E.) it is most desirable that the masses both those great and small [in Torah], should occupy themselves [in the study of Kabbalah], as it says in the Raya M'hemna [a section of the Zohar]. And because in this merit King Mashiach will come in the future—and not in any other merit—it is not proper to be discouraged [from the study of Kabbalah].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Avraham Azulai quoted in Erdstein, Baruch Emanuel. [http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Introductions/whatis/The_Need_to_Learn_Kabbala.asp#Tetra3 The Need to Learn Kabbala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205012016/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Introductions/whatis/The_Need_to_Learn_Kabbala.asp |date=2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question, however, is whether the ban ever existed in the first place.{{who said|date=November 2013}} Concerning the above quote by Avraham Azulai, it has found many versions in English, another is this
{{quote|From the year 1540 and onward, the basic levels of Kabbalah must be taught publicly to everyone, young and old. Only through Kabbalah will we forever eliminate war, destruction, and man's inhumanity to his fellow man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=about/histmakers/13&amp;page=1 ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106101518/https://www.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p%3Dabout/histmakers/13%26page%3D1 |date=November 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The lines concerning the year 1490 are also missing from the Hebrew edition of ''Hesed L'Avraham'', the source work that both of these quote from. Furthermore, by Azulai's view the ban was lifted thirty years before his birth, a time that would have corresponded with Haim Vital's publication of the teaching of Isaac Luria. Moshe Isserles understood there to be only a minor restriction, in his words, "One's belly must be full of meat and wine, discerning between the prohibited and the permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh YD 246:4&lt;/ref&gt; He is supported by the Bier Hetiv, the Pithei Teshuva as well as the [[Vilna Gaon]]. The Vilna Gaon says, "There was never any ban or enactment restricting the study of the wisdom of Kabbalah. Any who says there is has never studied Kabbalah, has never seen PaRDeS, and speaks as an ignoramus."&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh 246:4 S"K 19 {{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sefardi and Mizrahi ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
[[File:YeshivatBeitEl entree.jpg|thumb|[[Beit El Synagogue|Synagogue Beit El]] Jerusalem. Oriental Judaism has its own chain of Kabbalah]]
The Kabbalah of the [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] (Iberian Peninsula) and [[Mizrahi]] (Middle East, North Africa, and the Caucasus) Torah scholars has a long history. Kabbalah in various forms was widely studied, commented upon, and expanded by North African, Turkish, Yemenite, and Asian scholars from the 16th century onward. It flourished among Sefardic Jews in Tzfat ([[Safed]]), Israel even before the arrival of Isaac Luria. Yosef Karo, author of the ''Shulchan Arukh'' was part of the Tzfat school of Kabbalah. Shlomo Alkabetz, author of the hymn ''[[Lekhah Dodi]]'', taught there.

His disciple Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (or Cordoeiro) authored ''[[Pardes Rimonim]]'', an organised, exhaustive compilation of kabbalistic teachings on a variety of subjects up to that point. Cordovero headed the academy of Tzfat until his death, when [[Isaac Luria]] rose to prominence. Rabbi Moshe's disciple [[Eliyahu De Vidas]] authored the classic work, ''Reishit Chochma'', combining kabbalistic and ''mussar'' (moral) teachings. [[Chaim Vital]] also studied under Cordovero, but with the arrival of Luria became his main disciple. Vital claimed to be the only one authorised to transmit the Ari's teachings, though other disciples also published books presenting Luria's teachings.

The Oriental Kabbalist tradition continues until today among Sephardi and Mizrachi Hakham sages and study circles. Among leading figures were the Yemenite [[Shalom Sharabi]] (1720–1777) of the [[Beit El Synagogue]], the Jerusalemite [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Hida]] (1724–1806), the Baghdad leader [[Ben Ish Chai]] (1832–1909), and the [[Baba Sali|Abuhatzeira]] dynasty.

==== ''Maharal'' ====
[[File:Loew-rabin-tombstone.jpg|thumb|The 16th-century [[Maharal]] of Prague articulated a mystical exegesis in philosophical language]]
One of the most innovative theologians in early-modern Judaism was [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1525–1609) known as the "Maharal of Prague". Many of his written works survive and are studied for their unusual combination of the mystical and philosophical approaches in Judaism. While conversant in Kabbalistic learning, he expresses Jewish mystical thought in his own individual approach without reference to Kabbalistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', [[Louis Jacobs]], Oxford University Press 1995: entry on Judah Loew&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharal is most well known in popular culture for the legend of the [[golem]] of Prague, associated with him in folklore. However, his thought influenced Hasidism, for example being studied in the introspective Przysucha school. During the 20th century, [[Isaac Hutner]] (1906–1980) continued to spread the Maharal's works indirectly through his own teachings and publications within the non-Hasidic yeshiva world.

==== Sabbatian mysticism ====
The spiritual and mystical yearnings of many Jews remained frustrated after the death of Isaac Luria and his disciples and colleagues. No hope was in sight for many following the devastation and mass killings of the [[pogrom]]s that followed in the wake of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki Uprising]] (1648–1654), the largest single massacre of Jews until the Holocaust, and it was at this time that a controversial scholar by the name of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) captured the hearts and minds of the Jewish masses of that time with the promise of a newly minted messianic [[Millennialism]] in the form of his own personage.

His charisma, mystical teachings that included repeated pronunciations of the holy [[Tetragrammaton]] in public, tied to an unstable personality, and with the help of his greatest enthusiast, [[Nathan of Gaza]], convinced the Jewish masses that the Jewish Messiah had finally come. It seemed that the esoteric teachings of Kabbalah had found their "champion" and had triumphed, but this era of Jewish history unravelled when Zevi became an [[Apostasy|apostate]] to Judaism by converting to Islam after he was arrested by the Ottoman Sultan and threatened with execution for attempting a plan to conquer the world and rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Unwilling to give up their messianic expectations, a minority of Zvi's Jewish followers converted to Islam along with him.

Many of his followers, known as [[Sabbateans|Sabbatians]], continued to worship him in secret, explaining his conversion not as an effort to save his life but to recover the sparks of the holy in each religion, and most leading rabbis were always on guard to root them out. The [[Dönmeh]] movement in modern Turkey is a surviving remnant of the Sabbatian schism.

Due to the chaos caused in the Jewish world, the rabbinic prohibition against studying Kabbalah established itself firmly within the Jewish religion. One of the conditions allowing a man to study and engage himself in the Kabbalah was to be at least forty years old. This age requirement came about during this period and is not Talmudic in origin but rabbinic. Many Jews are familiar with this ruling, but are not aware of its origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjli.com/index.html?task=news_full&amp;nid=374 |title=News |publisher=myJLI.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the prohibition is not halakhic in nature. According to Moses Cordovero, halakhically, one must be of age twenty to engage in the Kabbalah. Many famous kabbalists, including the ARI, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Yehuda Ashlag, were younger than twenty when they began.

==== Frankism ====
The Sabbatian movement was followed by that of the [[Frankism|Frankists]] who were disciples of [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791) who eventually became an apostate to Judaism by apparently converting to [[Catholicism]]. This era of disappointment did not stem the Jewish masses' yearnings for "mystical" leadership.

==== Modern-era traditional Kabbalah ====
[[File:Headstone of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in Tiberias.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], a leading Italian kabbalist, also wrote secular works, which the Haskalah see as the start of modern [[Hebrew literature]]]]
[[File:Vilna Gaon authentic portrait.JPG|thumb|The [[Vilna Gaon]], 18th-century leader of rabbinic opposition to Hasidism - a Kabbalist who opposed Hasidic doctrinal and practical innovations]]

[[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] (1707–1746), based in Italy, was a precocious Talmudic scholar who deduced a need for the public teaching and study of Kabbalah. He established a yeshiva for Kabbalah study and actively recruited students. He wrote copious manuscripts in an appealing clear Hebrew style, all of which gained the attention of both admirers and rabbinical critics, who feared another "Shabbetai Zevi" (false messiah) in the making. His rabbinical opponents forced him to close his school, hand over and destroy many of his most precious unpublished kabbalistic writings, and go into exile in the Netherlands. He eventually moved to the [[Land of Israel]]. Some of his most important works, such as ''[[Derekh Hashem]]'', survive and serve as a gateway to the world of Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where to Start - Recommended books|url=http://www.azamra.org/Kabbalah/starting.htm|website=Azamra, Torah for our Time|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elijah of Vilna]] (Vilna Gaon) (1720–1797), based in Lithuania, had his teachings encoded and publicised by his disciples, such as [[Chaim Volozhin]]'s posthumously published the mystical-ethical work ''[[Nefesh HaChaim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul of Life: The Complete Neffesh Ha-chayyim: Rav Chayyim of Volozhin, Eliezer Lipa (Leonard) Moskowitz: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |isbn= 9780615699912}}&lt;/ref&gt; He staunchly opposed the new Hasidic movement and warned against their public displays of religious fervour inspired by the mystical teachings of their rabbis. Although the Vilna Gaon did not look with favor on the Hasidic movement, he did not prohibit the study and engagement in the Kabbalah. This is evident from his writings in the ''Even Shlema''. "He that is able to understand secrets of the Torah and does not try to understand them will be judged harshly, may God have mercy". (The Vilna Gaon, ''Even Shlema'', 8:24). "The Redemption will only come about through learning Torah, and the essence of the Redemption depends upon learning Kabbalah" (The Vilna Gaon, ''Even Shlema'', 11:3).

In the Oriental tradition of Kabbalah, Shalom Sharabi (1720–1777) from Yemen was a major esoteric clarifier of the works of the Ari. The Beit El Synagogue, "yeshivah of the kabbalists", which he came to head, was one of the few communities to bring Lurianic meditation into communal prayer.&lt;ref name="nola.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nola.com/community/st-tammany/index.ssf/2014/01/theology_on_tap_winter_2014_un.html |title=Theology on Tap Winter 2014 under way in Mandeville: Keeping the Faith |publisher=NOLA.com |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/535848 |title=Jews of Ponte Vedra/Jacksonville Beaches Address Relevance of Judaism in Modern Society |publisher=PR.com |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, Yehuda Ashlag (1885—1954) in Mandate Palestine became a leading esoteric kabbalist in the traditional mode, who translated the Zohar into Hebrew with a new approach in Lurianic Kabbalah.

==== Hasidic Judaism ====
[[File:Besht Shul2 Medzhibozh.jpg|thumb|Synagogue of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], founder of Hasidism, in [[Medzhybizh]] Ukraine. It gave a new phase to Jewish mysticism, seeking its popularisation through [[Deveikut|internal]] correspondence]]
{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}
[[Baal Shem Tov|Israel ben Eliezer Baal Shem Tov]] (1698–1760), founder of Hasidism in the area of the Ukraine, spread teachings based on Lurianic Kabbalah, but adapted to a different aim of immediate psychological perception of Divine Omnipresence amidst the mundane. The emotional, ecstatic fervour of early Hasidism developed from previous [[Tzadikim Nistarim|Nistarim]] circles of mystical activity, but instead sought communal revival of the common folk by reframing Judaism around the central principle of [[devekut]] (mystical cleaving to God) for all. This new approach turned formerly esoteric elite kabbalistic theory into a popular social mysticism movement for the first time, with its own doctrines, classic texts, teachings and customs. From the Baal Shem Tov sprang the wide ongoing schools of Hasidic Judaism, each with different approaches and thought. Hasidism instituted a new concept of [[Tzadik]] leadership in Jewish mysticism, where the elite scholars of mystical texts now took on a social role as embodiments and intercessors of Divinity for the masses. With the 19th-century consolidation of the movement, [[Rebbe|leadership]] became dynastic.

Among later Hasidic schools:
[[Nachman of Breslov|Rebbe Nachman of Breslov]] (1772–1810), the great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, revitalised and further expanded the latter's teachings, amassing a following of thousands in Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. In a unique amalgam of Hasidic and ''[[Mitnagdim|Mitnaged]]'' approaches, Rebbe Nachman emphasised study of both Kabbalah and serious Torah scholarship to his disciples. His teachings also differed from the way other Hasidic groups were developing, as he rejected the idea of hereditary [[Hasidic dynasty|Hasidic dynasties]] and taught that each Hasid must "search for the ''[[tzaddik]]'' ('saintly/righteous person')" for himself and within himself.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The [[Chabad|Habad-Lubavitch]] intellectual school of Hasidism broke away from General-Hasidism's emotional faith orientation, by making the mind central as the route to the internal heart. Its texts combine what they view as rational investigation with explanation of Kabbalah through articulating unity in a common Divine essence. In recent times, the [[Chabad messianism|messianic element]] latent in Hasidism has come to the fore in Habad.

==== 20th-century influence ====
Jewish mysticism has influenced the thought of some major Jewish theologians in the 20th century, outside of Kabbalistic or Hasidic traditions. The first Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] was a mystical thinker who drew heavily on Kabbalistic notions through his own poetic terminology. His writings are concerned with fusing the false divisions between sacred and secular, rational and mystical, legal and imaginative. Students of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], figurehead of American [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] have read the influence of Kabbalistic symbols in his philosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dan, ''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, chapter on the Contemporary Era&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Hasidism, rather than Kabbalah, shaped [[Martin Buber]]'s philosophy of dialogue and [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]'s [[Conservative Judaism]]. Lurianic symbols of Tzimtzum and Shevirah have informed [[Holocaust theology|Holocaust theologians]].&lt;ref&gt;Such as the theological novel ''The Town Beyond The Wall'' by Elie Wiesel. Norman Lamm gives a Biblical, Midrashic and Kabbalistic exegesis of it in ''Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought'', Ktav pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Concealed and revealed God ===
[[File:Ein sof.png|thumb|Metaphorical scheme of emanated spiritual worlds within the ''Ein Sof'']]
The nature of the divine prompted kabbalists to envision two aspects to God: (a) God in essence, absolutely transcendent, unknowable, limitless [[divine simplicity]], and (b) God in manifestation, the revealed persona of God through which he creates and sustains and relates to mankind. Kabbalists speak of the first as ''Ein/Ayn Sof'' (אין סוף "the infinite/endless", literally "there is no end"). Of the impersonal ''Ein Sof'' nothing can be grasped. However the second aspect of divine emanations, are accessible to human perception, dynamically interacting throughout spiritual and physical existence, reveal the divine immanently, and are bound up in the life of man. Kabbalists believe that these two aspects are not contradictory but complement one another, emanations revealing the concealed mystery from within the Godhead.

The Zohar reads the first words of Genesis, ''BeReishit Bara Elohim&amp;nbsp;– In the beginning God created'', as "With the level of "''Reishit-Beginning''" the ''Ein Sof'' created ''[[Elohim]]''-God's manifestation in creation:{{clarify|date=October 2014}}
{{quote|At the very beginning the King made engravings in the supernal purity. A spark of blackness emerged in the sealed within the sealed, from the mystery of the Ayn Sof, a mist within matter, implanted in a ring, no white, no black, no red, no yellow, no colour at all. When He measured with the standard of measure, He made colours to provide light. Within the spark, in the innermost part, emerged a source, from which the colours are painted below; it is sealed among the sealed things of the mystery of Ayn Sof. It penetrated, yet did not penetrate its air. It was not known at all until, from the pressure of its penetration, a single point shone, sealed, supernal. Beyond this point nothing is known, so it is called ''reishit'' (beginning): the first word of all ...&lt;ref&gt;Zohar I, 15a English translation from '' Jewish Mysticism&amp;nbsp;– An Anthology'', Dan Cohn-Sherbok, Oneworld pub, p.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; "}}

The structure of emanations has been described in various ways: Sephirot (divine attributes) and [[Partzufim]] (divine "faces"), [[Ohr]] (spiritual light and flow), Names of God and the supernal Torah, Olamot (Spiritual Worlds), a Divine Tree and Archetypal Man, Angelic Chariot and Palaces, male and female, enclothed layers of reality, inwardly holy vitality and external Kelipot shells, 613 channels ("limbs" of the King) and the divine souls in man. These symbols are used to describe various parts and aspects of the model.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Sephirot ===
{{Main article|Sefirot}}
[[File:Sefiroticky strom.jpg|thumb|Scheme of descending [[Sephirot]] in 3 columns, as a tree with roots above and branches below]]
The ''Sephirot'' (also spelled "sefirot"; singular ''sefirah'') are the ten emanations and attributes of God with which he continually sustains the existence of the universe. The Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts elaborate on the emergence of the sephirot from a state of concealed potential in the ''Ein Sof'' until their manifestation in the mundane world. In particular,
Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (known as "the Ramak"), describes how God emanated the myriad details of finite reality out of the absolute unity of Divine light via the ten sephirot, or vessels.&lt;ref name="Wyn" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Comparison of the Ramak's counting with Luria's, describes dual rational and unconscious aspects of Kabbalah. Two metaphors are used to describe the ''sephirot'', their [[theocentric]] manifestation as the Trees of Life and Knowledge, and their [[anthropocentric]] correspondence in man, exemplified as [[Adam Kadmon]]. This dual-directional perspective embodies the cyclical, inclusive nature of the divine flow, where alternative divine and human perspectives have validity. The central metaphor of man allows human understanding of the sephirot, as they correspond to the psychological faculties of the soul, and incorporate masculine and feminine aspects after Genesis 1:27 ("God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them"). Corresponding to the last ''sefirah'' in Creation is the indwelling shekhinah (Feminine Divine Presence). Downward flow of divine Light in Creation forms the supernal [[Four Worlds]]; [[Atziluth]], [[Beri'ah]], [[Yetzirah]] and [[Assiah]] manifesting the dominance of successive sephirot towards action in this world. The acts of man unite or divide the Heavenly masculine and feminine aspects of the sephirot, their anthropomorphic harmony completing Creation. As the spiritual foundation of Creation, the sephirot correspond to the [[names of God in Judaism]] and the particular nature of any entity.

==== Ten Sephirot as process of Creation {{anchor|Ten Sephirot as process of Creation}} ====
According to Lurianic cosmology, the ''sephirot'' correspond to various levels of creation (ten ''sephirot'' in each of the Four Worlds, and four worlds within each of the larger four worlds, each containing ten ''sephirot'', which themselves contain ten ''sephirot'', to an infinite number of possibilities),&lt;ref&gt;See ''Otzrot Haim: Sha'ar TNT"A'' for a short explanation. The vast majority of the Lurianic system deals only with the complexities found in the world of Atzilut as is explained in the introductions to both Otzrot Haim and Eitz Haim.&lt;/ref&gt; and are emanated from the Creator for the purpose of creating the universe. The ''sephirot'' are considered revelations of the Creator's will (''ratzon''),&lt;ref&gt;''The Song of the Soul'', Yechiel Bar-Lev, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and they should not be understood as ten different "gods" but as ten different ways the one God reveals his will through the Emanations. It is not God who changes but the ability to perceive God that changes.

==== Ten Sephirot as process of ethics {{anchor|Ten Sephirot as process of ethics}} ====
[[File:Shefa Tal.png|thumb|In the 16-17th centuries Kabbalah was popularised through a new genre of ethical literature, related to Kabbalistic meditation]]
Divine creation by means of the Ten Sephirot is an ethical process. They represent the different aspects of Morality. Loving-Kindness is a possible moral justification found in Chessed, and Gevurah is the Moral Justification of Justice and both are mediated by Mercy which is Rachamim. However, these pillars of morality become immoral once they become extremes. When Loving-Kindness becomes extreme it can lead to sexual depravity and lack of Justice to the wicked. When Justice becomes extreme, it can lead to torture and the Murder of innocents and unfair punishment.

"Righteous" humans (''tzadikim'') ascend these ethical qualities of the ten ''sephirot'' by doing righteous actions. If there were no righteous humans, the blessings of God would become completely hidden, and creation would cease to exist. While real human actions are the "Foundation" (''[[Yesod]]'') of this universe (''[[Malchut]]''), these actions must accompany the conscious intention of compassion. Compassionate actions are often impossible without faith (''Emunah''), meaning to trust that God always supports compassionate actions even when God seems hidden. Ultimately, it is necessary to show compassion toward oneself too in order to share compassion toward others. This "selfish" enjoyment of God's blessings but only in order to empower oneself to assist others is an important aspect of "Restriction", and is considered a kind of [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] in kabbalah, corresponding to the ''sefirah'' of Adornment ([[Tiferet]]) being part of the "Middle Column".

Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, wrote ''[[Tomer Devorah]]'' (''Palm Tree of Deborah''), in which he presents an ethical teaching of Judaism in the kabbalistic context of the ten ''sephirot''. ''Tomer Devorah'' has become also a foundational [[Musar literature|Musar text]].&lt;ref&gt;J.H.Laenen, ''Jewish Mysticism'', p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divine Feminine ===
{{Main article|Shekhinah}}

=== Descending spiritual worlds ===
Medieval Kabbalists believed that all things are linked to God through these emanations, making all levels in creation part of one great, gradually descending [[chain of being]]. Through this any lower creation reflects its particular characteristics in Supernal Divinity.

Hasidic thought extends the [[immanence|divine immanence]] of Kabbalah by holding that God is all that really exists, all else being completely undifferentiated from God's perspective. This view can be defined as monistic [[panentheism]]. According to this philosophy, God's existence is higher than anything that this world can express, yet he includes all things of this world within his Divine reality in perfect unity, so that the Creation effected no change in him at all. This paradox is dealt with at length in Chabad texts.&lt;ref&gt;Wineberg, chs. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of evil ===
[[File:Kaphtziel.jpg|thumb|Amulet from the 15th century. Theosophical kabbalists, especially Luria, censored contemporary Practical Kabbalah, but allowed amulets by Sages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.inner.org/kabbalah/beginner/practical.htm |title=Beginner Level Kabbalah: What is Practical Kabbalah? |publisher=Inner.org |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among problems considered in the Hebrew Kabbalah is the theological issue of the nature and origin of evil. In the views of some Kabbalists this conceives "evil" as a "quality of God", asserting that negativity enters into the essence of the Absolute. In this view it is conceived that the Absolute needs evil to "be what it is", i.e., to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Piero|last=Cantoni|title=Demonology and Praxis of Exorcism and of the Liberation Prayers", in Fides Catholica 1|year=2006|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/5555670/Pietro-CantoniTeologia-dell-esorcismo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105115936/http://www.scribd.com/doc/5555670/Pietro-CantoniTeologia-dell-esorcismo|archivedate=2011-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational texts of Medieval Kabbalism conceived evil as a demonic parallel to the holy, called the ''Sitra Achra'' (the "Other Side"), and the ''Kelipot/Qliphoth'' (the "Shells/Husks") that cover and conceal the holy, are nurtured from it, and yet also protect it by limiting its revelation. Scholem termed this element of the Spanish Kabbalah a "Jewish gnostic" motif, in the sense of dual powers in the divine realm of manifestation. In a radical notion, the root of evil is found within the 10 holy Sephirot, through an imbalance of [[Gevurah]], the power of "Strength/Judgement/Severity".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Gevurah is necessary for Creation to exist as it counterposes [[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] ("loving-kindness"), restricting the unlimited divine bounty within suitable vessels, so forming the Worlds. However, if man sins (actualising impure judgement within his soul), the supernal Judgement is reciprocally empowered over the Kindness, introducing disharmony among the Sephirot in the divine realm and exile from God throughout Creation. The demonic realm, though illusory in its holy origin, becomes the real apparent realm of impurity in lower Creation.

=== Role of Man ===
[[File:ציון רבי יוסף קארו.JPG|thumb|[[Joseph Karo]]'s role as both legalist and mystic underscores Kabbalah's spiritualisation of normative Jewish observance]]
Kabbalistic doctrine gives man the central role in Creation, as his soul and body correspond to the supernal divine manifestations. In the Christian Kabbalah this scheme was universalised to describe ''harmonia mundi'', the harmony of Creation within man.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dan, ''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford, chapter on "Christian Kabbalah"&lt;/ref&gt; In Judaism, it gave a profound spiritualisation of Jewish practice. While the kabbalistic scheme gave a radically innovative, though conceptually continuous, development of mainstream Midrashic and Talmudic rabbinic notions, kabbalistic thought underscored and invigorated conservative Jewish observance. The esoteric teachings of kabbalah gave the traditional mitzvot observances the central role in spiritual creation, whether the practitioner was learned in this knowledge or not. Accompanying normative Jewish observance and worship with elite mystical kavanot intentions gave them [[theurgic]] power, but sincere observance by common folk, especially in the Hasidic popularisation of kabbalah, could replace esoteric abilities. Many kabbalists were also leading legal figures in Judaism, such as Nachmanides and [[Joseph Karo]].

Medieval kabbalah elaborates particular reasons for each Biblical [[mitzvah]], and their role in harmonising the supernal divine flow, uniting masculine and feminine forces on High. With this, the feminine Divine presence in this world is drawn from exile to the Holy One Above. The [[613 mitzvot]] are embodied in the organs and soul of man. Lurianic kabbalah incorporates this in the more inclusive scheme of Jewish messianic rectification of exiled divinity. Jewish mysticism, in contrast to Divine transcendence rationalist human-centred reasons for Jewish observance, gave Divine-immanent providential cosmic significance to the daily events in the worldly life of man in general, and the spiritual role of Jewish observance in particular.

=== Levels of the soul ===
[[File:Abraham abulafia.jpg|120px|thumb|Building on Kabbalah's conception of the soul, [[Abraham Abulafia]]'s meditations included the "inner illumination of" the human form&lt;ref&gt;(Otzar Eden Ganuz, Oxford Ms. 1580, fols. 163b-164a; see also Hayei Haolam Haba, Oxford 1582, fol. 12a)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Kabbalah posits that the human soul has three elements, the ''nefesh'', ''ru'ach'', and ''neshamah''. The ''nefesh'' is found in all humans, and enters the physical body at birth. It is the source of one's physical and psychological nature. The next two parts of the soul are not implanted at birth, but can be developed over time; their development depends on the actions and beliefs of the individual. They are said to only fully exist in people awakened spiritually. A common way of explaining the three parts of the soul is as follows:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* ''Nefesh'' (נפש): the lower part, or "animal part", of the soul. It is linked to instincts and bodily cravings. This part of the soul is provided at birth.
* ''Ruach'' (רוח): the middle soul, the "spirit". It contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil.
* ''Neshamah'' (נשמה): the higher soul, or "super-soul". This separates man from all other life-forms. It is related to the intellect and allows man to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife. It allows one to have some awareness of the existence and presence of God.

The [[Raaya Meheimna]], a section of related teachings spread throughout the Zohar, discusses fourth and fifth parts of the human soul, the ''chayyah'' and ''yehidah'' (first mentioned in the Midrash Rabbah). Gershom Scholem writes that these "were considered to represent the sublimest levels of intuitive cognition, and to be within the grasp of only a few chosen individuals". The Chayyah and the Yechidah do not enter into the body like the other three—thus they received less attention in other sections of the ''Zohar''.

* ''Chayyah'' (חיה): The part of the soul that allows one to have an awareness of the divine life force itself.
* ''Yehidah'' (יחידה): The highest plane of the soul, in which one can achieve as full a union with God as is possible.

Both rabbinic and kabbalistic works posit that there are a few additional, non-permanent states of the soul that people can develop on certain occasions. These extra souls, or extra states of the soul, play no part in any afterlife scheme, but are mentioned for completeness:
* ''Ruach HaKodesh'' (רוח הקודש) ("spirit of holiness"): a state of the soul that makes prophecy possible. Since the age of classical prophecy passed, no one (outside of Israel) receives the soul of prophecy any longer.
* ''Neshamah Yeseira'': The "supplemental soul" that a Jew can experience on [[Shabbat]]. It makes possible an enhanced spiritual enjoyment of the day. This exists only when one is observing Shabbat; it can be lost and gained depending on one's observance.
* ''Neshamah Kedosha'': Provided to Jews at the age of maturity (13 for boys, 12 for girls) and is related to the study and fulfillment of the Torah commandments. It exists only when one studies and follows the Torah; it can be lost and gained depending on one's study and observance.

=== Reincarnation ===
{{Main article|Gilgul}}
[[Reincarnation]], the transmigration of the soul after death, was introduced into Judaism as a central esoteric tenet of Kabbalah from the Medieval period onwards, called Gilgul neshamot ("cycles of the soul"). The concept does not appear overtly in the Hebrew Bible or classic rabbinic literature, and was rejected by various Medieval Jewish philosophers. However, the Kabbalists explained a number of scriptural passages in reference to Gilgulim. The concept became central to the later Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, who systemised it as the personal parallel to the cosmic process of rectification. Through Lurianic Kabbalah and Hasidic Judaism, reincarnation entered popular Jewish culture as a literary motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/reincarnation-the-transmigration-of-a-jewish-idea/|title=What Judaism Says About Reincarnation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tzimtzum, Shevirah and Tikkun ===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 11324 The city wore white.jpg|thumb|16th-century graves of [[Safed]], [[Galilee]]. The messianic focus of its mystical renaissance culminated in Lurianic thought.]]
''Tzimtzum'' (Constriction/Concentration) is the primordial cosmic act whereby God "contracted" His infinite light, leaving a "void" into which the light of existence was poured. This allowed the emergence of independent existence that would not become nullified by the pristine Infinite Light, reconciling the unity of the ''Ein Sof'' with the plurality of creation. This changed the first creative act into one of withdrawal/exile, the antithesis of the ultimate Divine Will. In contrast, a new emanation after the Tzimtzum shone into the vacuum to begin creation, but led to an initial instability called ''Tohu'' (Chaos), leading to a new crisis of ''Shevirah'' (Shattering) of the sephirot vessels. The shards of the broken vessels fell down into the lower realms, animated by remnants of their divine light, causing primordial exile within the Divine Persona before the creation of man. Exile and enclothement of higher divinity within lower realms throughout existence requires man to complete the ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Rectification) process. Rectification Above corresponds to the reorganization of the independent sephirot into relating ''Partzufim'' (Divine Personas), previously referred to obliquely in the Zohar. From the catastrophe stems the possibility of self-aware Creation, and also the ''Kelipot'' (Impure Shells) of previous Medieval kabbalah. The metaphorical [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphism]] of the partzufim accentuates the sexual unifications of the redemption process, while [[Gilgul]] reincarnation emerges from the scheme. Uniquely, Lurianism gave formerly private mysticism the urgency of Messianic social involvement.

According to interpretations of Luria, the catastrophe stemmed from the "unwillingness" of the residue imprint after the Tzimtzum to relate to the new vitality that began creation. The process was arranged to shed and harmonise the Divine Infinity with the latent potential of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dan, ''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', tentative analysis of Gershom Scholem and Isaiah Tishby of Luria's scheme&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[Adam]] would have redeemed existence, but his sin caused new shevirah of Divine vitality, requiring the Giving of the Torah to begin Messianic rectification. Historical and individual history becomes the narrative of reclaiming exiled Divine sparks.

=== Linguistic mysticism of Hebrew ===
Kabbalistic thought extended Biblical and Midrashic notions that God enacted Creation through the Hebrew language and through the Torah into a full linguistic mysticism. In this, every Hebrew letter, word, number, even accent on words of the Hebrew Bible contain esoteric meanings, describing the spiritual dimensions within exoteric ideas, and it teaches the [[hermeneutic]] methods of interpretation for ascertaining these meanings. Names of God in Judaism have further prominence, though fluidity of meaning turns the whole Torah into a Divine name. As the Hebrew name of things is the channel of their lifeforce, parallel to the sephirot, so concepts such as "holiness" and "[[mitzvot]]" embody ontological Divine immanence, as God can be known in manifestation as well as transcendence. The infinite potential of meaning in the Torah, as in the ''Ein Sof'', is reflected in the symbol of the two trees of the Garden of Eden; the Torah of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] is the external, Halachic Torah, through which mystics can perceive the unlimited Torah of the Tree of Life. In Lurianic expression, each of the 600,000 souls of Israel find their own interpretation in Torah.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As early as the 1st century BCE Jews believed that the Torah and other canonical texts contained encoded messages and hidden meanings. [[Gematria]] is one method for discovering its hidden meanings. Each letter in Hebrew also represents a number; Hebrew, unlike many other languages, never developed a separate [[Hebrew alphabet#Numeric values of letters|numerical alphabet]]. By converting letters to numbers, Kabbalists were able to find a hidden meaning in each word. This method of interpretation was used extensively by various schools.

{{Main article|Kabbalah: Primary texts}}
Like the rest of the rabbinic literature, the texts of kabbalah were once part of an ongoing oral tradition, though, over the centuries, much of the oral tradition has been written down.

Jewish forms of esotericism existed over 2,000 years ago. [[Ben Sira]] (born c. 170 BCE) warns against it, saying: "You shall have no business with secret things".&lt;ref&gt;''Sirach'' iii. 22; compare Talmud, ''Hagigah'', 13a; Midrash ''Genesis Rabbah'', viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, mystical studies were undertaken and resulted in mystical literature, the first being the [[Apocalyptic literature]] of the second and first pre-Christian centuries and which contained elements that carried over to later kabbalah.

Throughout the centuries since, many texts have been produced, among them the ancient descriptions of ''Sefer Yetzirah'', the ''Heichalot'' mystical ascent literature, the ''Bahir'', ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'' and the ''Zohar'', the main text of Kabbalistic exegesis. Classic mystical Bible commentaries are included in fuller versions of the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' (Main Commentators). Cordoveran systemisation is presented in ''Pardes Rimonim'', philosophical articulation in the works of the [[Maharal]], and Lurianic rectification in ''Etz Chayim''. Subsequent interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah was made in the writings of Shalom Sharabi, in ''Nefesh HaChaim'' and the 20th-century ''Sulam''. Hasidism interpreted kabbalistic structures to their correspondence in inward perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm |title=Overview of Chassidut (Chassidus) &amp;#124; |publisher=Inner.org |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasidic development of kabbalah incorporates a successive stage of Jewish mysticism from historical kabbalistic metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;The Founder of Hasidism, the [[Baal Shem Tov]], cautioned against the layman learning Kabbalah without its Hasidic explanation. He saw this as the cause of the contemporary mystical heresies of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and [[Jacob Frank]]. Cited in ''The Great Maggid'' by [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]], quoting ''Derech Mitzvosecha'' by [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==
{{Main article|List of Jewish mysticism scholars}}
The first modern-academic historians of Judaism, the "[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]" school of the 19th century, framed Judaism in solely rational terms in the emancipatory Haskalah spirit of their age. They opposed kabbalah and restricted its significance from Jewish historiography. In the mid-20th century, it was left to Gershom Scholem to overturn their stance, establishing the flourishing present-day academic investigation of Jewish mysticism, and making Heichalot, Kabbalistic and Hasidic texts the objects of scholarly critical-historical study. In Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components of Judaism were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the exoteric Halakha, were the living current in historical Jewish development.

The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] has been a centre of this research, including Scholem and [[Isaiah Tishby]], and more recently [[Joseph Dan]], [[Yehuda Liebes]], [[Rachel Elior]], and Moshe Idel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/events/event_files/past/_spring04/idel/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921015756/http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/events/event_files/past/_spring04/idel/index.html |date=September 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars across the eras of Jewish mysticism in America and Britain have included [[Arthur Green]], [[Lawrence Fine]], [[Elliot Wolfson]], [[Daniel C. Matt|Daniel Matt]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srhe.ucsb.edu/lectures/info/matt.html#bio {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828125703/http://www.srhe.ucsb.edu/lectures/info/matt.html |date=2012-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ada Rapoport-Albert]].

Moshe Idel has opened up research on the Ecstatic Kabbalah alongside the theosophical, and has called for new multi-disciplinary approaches, beyond the philological and historical that have dominated until now, to include [[Religious studies#Phenomenology|phenomenology]], [[Religious studies#Psychology of religion|psychology]], [[Religious studies#Anthropology of religion|anthropology]] and [[comparative studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Idel, ''Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims for authority ===
Historians have noted that most claims for the authority of kabbalah involve an argument of the antiquity of authority (see, e.g., Joseph Dan's discussion in his ''Circle of the Unique Cherub''). As a result, virtually all early foundational works [[pseudepigraph]]ically claim, or are ascribed, ancient authorship. For example, ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalach]]'', an astro-magical text partly based on a magical manual of late antiquity, ''[[Sefer ha-Razim]]'', was, according to the kabbalists, transmitted by the angel [[Raziel]] to Adam after he was evicted from Eden.

Another famous work, the early ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', is dated back to the patriarch [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name="Wyn" /&gt;{{rp|17}} This tendency toward pseudepigraphy has its roots in apocalyptic literature, which claims that esoteric knowledge such as magic, divination and astrology was transmitted to humans in the mythic past by the two angels, Aza and [[Azazel|Azaz'el]] (in other places, Azaz'el and Uzaz'el) who fell from heaven (see Genesis 6:4).

== Criticism ==
{{Criticism of Judaism}}

=== Dualistic cosmology ===
Although Kabbalah propounds the Unity of God, one of the most serious and sustained criticisms is that it may lead away from monotheism, and instead promote [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], the belief that there is a supernatural counterpart to God. The dualistic system holds that there is a good power versus an evil power. There are two primary models of Gnostic-dualistic cosmology: the first, which goes back to [[Zoroastrianism]], believes creation is ontologically divided between good and evil forces; the second, found largely in Greco-Roman [[metaphysics]] like [[Neo-Platonism]], argues that the universe knew a primordial harmony, but that a cosmic disruption yielded a second, evil dimension to reality. This second model influenced the cosmology of the Kabbalah.

According to Kabbalistic cosmology, the Ten Sephirot correspond to ten levels of creation. These levels of creation must not be understood as ten different "gods" but as ten different ways of revealing God, one per level. It is not God who changes but the ability to perceive God that changes.

While God may seem to exhibit dual natures (masculine-feminine, compassionate-judgmental, creator-creation), all adherents of Kabbalah have consistently stressed the ultimate unity of God. For example, in all discussions of Male and Female, the hidden nature of God exists above it all without limit, being called the Infinite or the "No End" (''Ein Sof'')—neither one nor the other, transcending any definition. The ability of God to become hidden from perception is called "Restriction" (Tzimtzum). Hiddenness makes creation possible because God can become "revealed" in a diversity of limited ways, which then form the building blocks of creation.

Kabbalistic texts, including the ''Zohar'', appear to affirm dualism, as they ascribe all evil to the separation from holiness known as the Sitra Achra&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Introductions/firststeps/The_Other_Side.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006181812/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Introductions/firststeps/The_Other_Side.asp |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("the other side") which is opposed to ''Sitra D'Kedushah'', or the Side of Holiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dovid |first=Nissan |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/361900/jewish/Kelipot-and-Sitra-Achra.htm |title=Kelipot and Sitra Achra - Kabbalah, Chassidism and Jewish Mysticism |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "left side" of divine emanation is a negative mirror image of the "side of holiness" with which it was locked in combat. [''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Volume 6, "Dualism", p.&amp;nbsp;244]. While this evil aspect exists within the divine structure of the Sephirot, the ''Zohar'' indicates that the Sitra Ahra has no power over ''Ein Sof'', and only exists as a necessary aspect of the creation of God to give man free choice, and that evil is the consequence of this choice. It is not a supernatural force opposed to God, but a reflection of the inner moral combat within mankind between the dictates of morality and the surrender to one's basic instincts.

David Gottlieb notes that many Kabbalists hold that the concepts of, e.g., a Heavenly Court or the Sitra Ahra are only given to humanity by God as a working model to understand His ways within our own epistemological limits. They reject the notion that a [[satan]] or [[angels]] actually exist. Others hold that non-divine spiritual entities were indeed created by God as a means for exacting his will.

According to Kabbalists, humans cannot yet understand the infinity of God. Rather, there is God as revealed to humans (corresponding to [[Zeir Anpin]]), and the rest of the infinity of God as remaining hidden from human experience (corresponding to Arich Anpin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Safedteachings/gor/Specific_and_General_Connections_115.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124192300/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/Safedteachings/gor/Specific_and_General_Connections_115.asp |date=January 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reading of this theology is monotheistic, similar to [[panentheism]]; another reading of the same theology is that it is dualistic. Gershom Scholem writes:
{{quotation|It is clear that with this postulate of an impersonal basic reality in God, which becomes a person—or appears as a person—only in the process of Creation and Revelation, Kabbalism abandons the personalistic basis of the Biblical conception of God....It will not surprise us to find that speculation has run the whole gamut—from attempts to re-transform the impersonal ''En-Sof'' into the personal God of the Bible to the downright heretical doctrine of a genuine dualism between the hidden ''Ein Sof'' and the personal Demiurge of Scripture. &lt;br /&gt;{{mdash}}''Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism'' Shocken Books (p.11–12)}}

=== Distinction between Jews and non-Jews ===
According to Isaac Luria (1534–72) and other commentators on the Zohar, righteous Gentiles do not have this demonic aspect and are in many ways similar to Jewish souls. A number of prominent Kabbalists, e.g., Pinchas Eliyahu of Vilna, the author of ''Sefer ha-Brit'', held that only some marginal elements in the humanity represent these demonic forces. On the other hand, the souls of Jewish heretics have much more satanic energy than the worst of idol worshippers; this view is popular in some Hasidic circles, especially [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On the other hand, many prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea and believed in essential equality of all human souls. [[Menahem Azariah da Fano]] (1548–1620), in his book ''Reincarnations of souls'', provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated into Jews and vice versa; the contemporary [[Habad]] rabbi and mystic Dov Ber Pinson teaches that distinctions between Jews and non-Jews in works such as the Tanya are not to be understood as literally referring to the external properties of a person (what religious community they are born into), but rather as referring to the properties of souls as they can be re-incarnated in any religious community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dov Ber Pinson, Reincarnation and Judaism&lt;/ref&gt;

But one point of view is represented by the Hasidic work ''Tanya'' (1797), in order to argue that Jews have a different character of soul: while a non-Jew, according to the author Shneur Zalman of Liadi (born 1745), can achieve a high level of spirituality, similar to an angel, his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one.&lt;ref name="סידור הרב, שער אכילת מצה"&gt;סידור הרב, שער אכילת מצה&lt;/ref&gt; A similar view is found in ''Kuzari'', an early medieval philosophical book by Yehuda Halevi (1075–1141 AD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Kuzari?lang=bi|title=Sefer Kuzari|website=www.sefaria.org|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent Habad rabbi, [[Abraham Yehudah Khein]] (born 1878), believed that spiritually elevated Gentiles have essentially Jewish souls, "who just lack the formal conversion to Judaism", and that unspiritual Jews are "Jewish merely by their birth documents".&lt;ref&gt;ר' אברהם חן, ביהדות התורה&lt;/ref&gt; The great 20th-century Kabbalist Yehuda Ashlag viewed the terms "Jews" and "Gentile" as different levels of perception, available to every human soul.

David Halperin&lt;ref&gt;article, ''The Seductiveness of Jewish Myth''&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the collapse of Kabbalah's influence among Western European Jews over the course of the 17th and 18th century was a result of the cognitive dissonance they experienced between the negative perception of Gentiles found in some exponents of Kabbalah, and their own positive dealings with non-Jews, which were rapidly expanding and improving during this period due to the influence of the Enlightenment.

However, a number of renowned Kabbalists claimed the exact opposite, stressing universality of all human souls and providing universal interpretations of the Kabbalistic tradition, including its Lurianic version. In their view, Kabbalah transcends the borders of Judaism and can serve as a basis of inter-religious theosophy and a universal religion. [[Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz]], a prominent Lithuanian-Galician Kabbalist of the 18th century and a moderate proponent of the Haskalah, called for brotherly love and solidarity between all nations, and believed that Kabbalah can empower everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, with prophetic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Love of one's Neighbour in Pinhas Hurwitz's Sefer ha-Berit, Resianne Fontaine, Studies in Hebrew Language and Jewish Culture, Presented to Albert van der Heide on the Occasion of his Sixty-Fifth Birthday, p.244-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Abraham Cohen de Herrera]] (1570–1635) are full of references to Gentile mystical philosophers. Such approach was particularly common among the Renaissance and post-Renaissance [[Italian Jews]]. Late medieval and Renaissance Italian Kabbalists, such as [[Yohanan Alemanno]], [[David Messer Leon]] and [[Abraham Yagel]], adhered to humanistic ideals and incorporated teachings of various Christian and pagan mystics.

A prime representative of this humanist stream in Kabbalah was [[Elijah Benamozegh]], who explicitly praised Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, as well as a whole range of ancient pagan mystical systems. He believed that Kabbalah can reconcile the differences between the world religions, which represent different facets and stages of the universal human spirituality. In his writings, Benamozegh interprets the [[New Testament]], [[Hadith]], [[Vedas]], [[Avesta]] and pagan mysteries according to the Kabbalistic theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Israel and Humanity, Elijah Benamozegh, Paulist Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

For a different perspective, see Wolfson.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, E.R. ''Venturing Beyond: Law and Morality in Kabbalistic Mysticism'', Oxford University Press, 2006, ch.1.&lt;/ref&gt; He provides numerous examples from the 17th to the 20th centuries, which would challenge the view of Halperin cited above as well as the notion that "modern Judaism" has rejected or dismissed this "outdated aspect" of the religion and, he argues, there are still Kabbalists today who harbor this view. He argues that, while it is accurate to say that many Jews do and would find this distinction offensive, it is inaccurate to say that the idea has been totally rejected in all circles. As Wolfson has argued, it is an ethical demand on the part of scholars to continue to be vigilant with regard to this matter and in this way the tradition can be refined from within.

However, as explained above, many well known Kabbalists rejected the literal interpretation of these seemingly discriminatory views. They argued that the term "Jew" was to be interpreted metaphorically, as referring to the spiritual development of the soul, rather than the superficial denomination of the individual, and they added a chain of intermediary states between "Jews" and idol worshippers, or spiritualised the very definition of "Jews" and "non-Jews" and argued that a soul can be re-incarnated in different communities (whether Jewish or not) as much as within a single one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Medieval views ===

[[File:Knesset Menorah P5200009J.JPG|thumb|Kabbalah mysticism on the [[Knesset Menorah]], which shared some similarities of theory with Jewish Neoplatonists]]
The idea that there are ten divine ''sephirot'' could evolve over time into the idea that "God is One being, yet in that One being there are Ten" which opens up a debate about what the "correct beliefs" in God should be, according to Judaism. [[Saadia Gaon]] teaches in his book [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot v'Deot]] that Jews who believe in reincarnation have adopted a non-Jewish belief.

Maimonides (12th century) rejected many of the texts of the [[Hekalot]], particularly ''[[Shi'ur Qomah]]'' whose starkly anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides' responsa siman ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1730&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=215 117 (Blau)] / [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1733&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=410 373 (Freimann)]), translated by [[Yosef Qafih]] and reprinted in his ''Collected Papers'', Volume 1, footnote 1 on pages 475-476; see also pages 477–478 where a booklet found in Maimonides' [[Genizah]] with the text of Shi'ur Qomah appears with an annotation, possibly by Maimonides, cursing believers of Shi'ur Qomah (Hebrew: ארור המאמינו) and praying that God be elevated exceedingly beyond that which the heretics say (Judeo-Arabic: תע' ת'ם תע' עמא יקולון אלכאפרון; Hebrew: יתעלה לעילא לעילא ממה שאומרים הכופרים).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nachmanides (13th century) provides background to many kabbalistic ideas. His works offer in-depth of various concepts. In fact, an entire book, entitled ''Gevuras Aryeh'', was authored by [[Yaakov Yehuda Aryeh Leib Frenkel]] and originally published in 1915, specifically to explain and elaborate on the kabbalistic concepts addressed by Nachmanides in his commentary to the Five books of Moses.

[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], in the spirit of his father Maimonides, [[Saadiah Gaon]], and other predecessors, explains at length in his ''Milḥamot HaShem'' that God is in no way literally within time or space nor physically outside time or space, since time and space simply do not apply to his being whatsoever. This is in contrast to certain popular understandings of modern Kabbalah which teach a form of panentheism, that his 'essence' is within everything.

Around the 1230s, [[Rabbi Meir ben Simon of Narbonne]] wrote an epistle (included in his ''Milḥemet Mitzvah'') against his contemporaries, the early Kabbalists, characterizing them as blasphemers who even approach heresy. He particularly singled out the Sefer Bahir, rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the ''tanna'' [[Nehunya ben HaKanah|R. Neḥunya ben ha-Kanah]] and describing some of its content as truly heretical.

[[Leon of Modena|Leone di Modena]], a 17th-century [[Venice|Venetian]] critic of Kabbalah, wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the kabbalistic doctrine of the ''sephirot''. This critique was in response to the knowledge that some European Jews of the period addressed individual ''sephirot'' in some of their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon. Apologists explain that Jews may have been praying ''for'' and not necessarily ''to'' the aspects of Godliness represented by the ''sephirot''.

[[Yaakov Emden]], 1697–1776, wrote the ''Mitpaḥath Sfarim'' (''Veil of the Books''), a detailed critique of the Zohar in which he concludes that certain parts of the Zohar contain heretical teaching and therefore could not have been written by Shimon bar Yochai.

Rabbi Yiḥyah founded [[yeshivot]], rabbinical schools, and synagogues that featured a rationalist approach to Judaism based on the Talmud and works of Saadia Gaon and Maimonides (Rambam).

[[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903–1994), an ultra-rationalist Modern Orthodox philosopher and brother of [[Nechama Leibowitz]], publicly shared views expressed in Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ's book ''Milḥamoth HaShem'' against mysticism. For example, Leibowitz called Kabbalah "a collection of "pagan superstitions" and "idol worship" in remarks given after receiving the [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] Award (English: worthy citizen of Jerusalem) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/255656275/Idol-Worship-is-Still-Within-Us-Yesayahu-Leibowitz |title=Idol Worship is Still Within Us- Yesayahu Leibowitz |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, rationalists holding similar views aligned with the rationalism of Dor Daim have described themselves as "talmide ha-Rambam" (disciples of Maimonides) rather than Dor Daim, and are more theologically aligned with the rationalism of Modern Orthodox Judaism than with Orthodox Ḥasidic or [[Haredi Judaism|Ḥaredi]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/52577/is-one-allowed-to-become-a-talmid-harambam |title=halacha - Is one allowed to become a Talmid HaRambam? - Mi Yodeya |publisher=Judaism.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is dispute among modern Haredim as to the status of Isaac Luria's, the [[Arizal]]'s Kabbalistic teachings. While a portion of Modern Orthodox rabbis, Dor Daim and many students of the [[Rambam]], completely reject Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings, as well as deny that the ''Zohar'' is authoritative, or from [[Shimon bar Yohai]], all three of these groups completely accept the existence and validity of ''Ma'aseh Merkavah'' and ''Ma'aseh B'resheet'' mysticism. Their only disagreement concerns whether the Kabbalistic teachings promulgated today are accurate representations of those esoteric teachings to which the Talmud refers. Within the Haredi Jewish community one can find both rabbis who sympathise with such a view, while not necessarily agreeing with it,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Ovadia Yosef]], who ruled that it is "impossible" to consider dardaim as heretics: לגבי הדרדעים "אי אפשר לדונם ככופרים"&lt;br /&gt;(מעין אומר סימן צג עמ' עדר) available at [http://hydepark.hevre.co.il/topic.asp?topic_id=2503514&amp;whichpage=4&amp;forum_id=20067#R_3 hydepark.hevre.co.il]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as rabbis who consider such a view absolute heresy. [[Eliyahu Dessler]] and [[Gedaliah Nadel]] maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140830135654/http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/ZoharEnglish.pdf#page=39#page=39 An Analysis of the Authenticity of the Zohar] (2005), p. 39, with "Rav E" and "Rav G" later identified by the author as [[Eliyahu Dessler]] and [[Gedaliah Nadel]], respectively ([[Marc Shapiro]] in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416154417/http://www.yctorah.org/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_download/gid%2C1861/ Milin Havivin Volume 5] [2011], Is there an obligation to believe that Rebbe Shimon bar Yochai wrote the ''Zohar''?, p. יב [PDF page 133]):

I would just add that not only is nikud mentioned, but only the Tiberian Nikkud - the norm in Europe of the middle ages - is mentioned and not the Yerushalmi nikud or the Babylonian one — which was used then in the Middle East, and is still used by Yemenites today. Also the Taamay Hamikrah - the trop - are referred to in the Zohar - only by their Sefardi Names.

=== Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism ===
[[File:Lekah Dodi.jpg|thumb|A version of [[Lekhah Dodi]] song to welcome the [[Shabbat]], a cross denomination Jewish custom from Kabbalah]]
Kabbalah tended to be rejected by most Jews in the Conservative and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements, though its influences were not completely eliminated. While it was generally not studied as a discipline, the Kabbalistic ''Kabbalat Shabbat'' service remained part of liberal liturgy, as did the ''Yedid Nefesh'' prayer. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, [[Saul Lieberman]] of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] is reputed to have introduced a lecture by Scholem on Kabbalah with a statement that Kabbalah itself was "nonsense", but the academic study of Kabbalah was "scholarship". This view became popular among many Jews, who viewed the subject as worthy of study, but who did not accept Kabbalah as teaching literal truths.

According to [[Bradley Shavit Artson]] (Dean of the Conservative [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] in the [[American Jewish University]]) {{quotation|Many western Jews insisted that their future and their freedom required shedding what they perceived as parochial orientalism.

However, in the late 20th century and early 21st century there has been a revival in interest in Kabbalah in all branches of liberal Judaism. The Kabbalistic 12th-century prayer ''[[Anim Zemirot]]'' was restored to the new Conservative ''Sim Shalom'' ''siddur'', as was the ''B'rikh Shmeh'' passage from the Zohar, and the mystical ''Ushpizin'' service welcoming to the ''[[Sukkah]]'' the spirits of Jewish forbearers. ''Anim Zemirot'' and the 16th-century mystical poem ''Lekhah Dodi'' reappeared in the Reform Siddur ''[[Gates of Prayer]]'' in 1975. All rabbinical seminaries now teach several courses in Kabbalah—in Conservative Judaism, both the Jewish Theological Seminary and the Ziegler School of Rabbinical Studies of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles have full-time instructors in Kabbalah and ''Hasidut'', Eitan Fishbane and Pinchas Giller, respectively. In the Reform movement Sharon Koren teaches at the Hebrew Union College. Reform rabbis like Herbert Weiner and [[Lawrence Kushner]] have renewed interest in Kabbalah among Reform Jews. At the Reconstructionist rabbinical College, the only accredited seminary that has curricular requirements in Kabbalah, Joel Hecker is the full-time instructor teaching courses in Kabbalah and Hasidut.

According to Artson: {{quotation|Ours is an age hungry for meaning, for a sense of belonging, for holiness. In that search, we have returned to the very Kabbalah our predecessors scorned. The stone that the builders rejected has become the head cornerstone (Psalm 118:22)... Kabbalah was the last universal theology adopted by the entire Jewish people, hence faithfulness to our commitment to positive-historical Judaism mandates a reverent receptivity to Kabbalah.&lt;ref name="Artson"/&gt;}}

The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement, under the leadership of Arthur Green in the 1980s and 1990s, and with the influence of Zalman Schachter Shalomi, brought a strong openness to Kabbalah and hasidic elements that then came to play prominent roles in the Kol ha-Neshamah siddur series.

== Contemporary study ==
Teaching of classic esoteric kabbalah texts and practice remained traditional until recent times, passed on in Judaism from master to disciple, or studied by leading rabbinic scholars. This changed in the 20th century, through conscious reform and the secular openness of knowledge. In contemporary times kabbalah is studied in four very different, though sometimes overlapping, ways:
* The traditional method, employed among Jews since the 16th century, continues in learned study circles. Its prerequisite is to either be born Jewish or be a convert and to join a group of kabbalists under the tutelage of a rabbi, since the 18th century more likely a Hasidic one, though others exist among Sephardi-Mizrachi, and Lithuanian rabbinic scholars. Beyond elite, historical esoteric kabbalah, the public-communally studied texts of Hasidic thought explain kabbalistic concepts for wide spiritual application, through their own concern with popular psychological perception of Divine Panentheism. In recent times, many [[Orthodox Jewish outreach]] organisations for secular Jews teach Kabbalistic and Hasidic texts.
* A second, new universalist form, is the method of modern-style Jewish organisations and writers, who seek to disseminate kabbalah to every man, woman and child regardless of race or class, especially since the Western interest in mysticism from the 1960s. These derive from various cross-denominational Jewish interests in kabbalah, and range from considered theology to popularised forms that often adopt New Age terminology and beliefs for wider communication. These groups highlight or interpret kabbalah through non-particularist, universalist aspects.
* A third way are non-Jewish organisations, mystery schools, initiation bodies, fraternities and [[secret society|secret societies]], the most popular of which are [[Freemasonry]], [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], although hundreds of similar societies claim a kabbalistic lineage. These derive from [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of Jewish kabbalah with Christian, occultist or contemporary New Age spirituality. As a separate spiritual tradition in Western esotericism since the Renaissance, with different aims from its Jewish origin, the non-Jewish traditions differ significantly and do not give an accurate representation of the Jewish spiritual understanding (or vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dan, ''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', chapters on Christian Kabbalah and the Contemporary Era&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourthly, since the mid-20th century, [[History|historical-critical]] scholarly investigation of all eras of Jewish mysticism has flourished into an established department of university [[Jewish studies]]. Where the first academic historians of Judaism in the 19th century opposed and marginalised kabbalah, Gershom Scholem and his successors repositioned the historiography of Jewish mysticism as a central, vital component of Judaic renewal through history. Cross-disciplinary academic revisions of Scholem's and others' theories are regularly published for wide readership.

=== Universalist Jewish organisations ===
The two, unrelated organisations that translate the mid-20th-century teachings of Yehuda Ashlag into a contemporary universalist message, have given kabbalah a public cross-religious profile:
* ''[[Bnei Baruch]]'' is a group of Kabbalah students, based in Israel. Study materials are available in over 25 languages for free online or at printing cost. Michael Laitman established Bnei Baruch in 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Ashlag's son Rav [[Baruch Ashlag]]. Laitman named his group Bnei Baruch (sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his mentor. The teaching strongly suggests restricting one's studies to 'authentic sources', kabbalists of the direct lineage of master to disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laitman.com/2008/07/on-authentic-sources/ |title=On Authentic Sources |publisher=Laitman.com |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/34327?/eng/content/view/full/34327&amp;main |title=The Teaching of the Kabbalah and Its Essence &amp;#124; Yehuda Leib HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) &amp;#124; Kabbalah Library - Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education &amp; Research Institute |publisher=Kabbalah.info |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Kabbalah Centre|The Kabbalah Centre]]'' was founded in the United States in 1965 as The National Research Institute of Kabbalah by [[Philip Berg]] and Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, disciple of Yehuda Ashlag's. Later Philip Berg and his wife re-established the organisation as the worldwide Kabbalah Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabbalah.com|title=The Kabbalah Centre - learn transform connect|work=kabbalah.com|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=The link directs to the front page, which says no word about the year of establishment|date=October 2017}} In recent times its outreach teaching in New Age style has attracted a cross-religious celebrity following and media profile, though the organisation is led by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10324260/Rabbi-Philip-Berg.html|title=Rabbi Philip Berg|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=2013-09-20|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent Jewish universalist organisations:
* ''[[Kabbalah Society|The Kabbalah Society]]'', run by [[Warren Kenton]], an organisation based instead on pre-Lurianic Medieval Kabbalah presented in universalist New Age syncretic style. In contrast, traditional kabbalists read earlier kabbalah through later Lurianism and the systemisations of 16th-century Safed.
* ''The New Kabbalah'', website and books by Sanford L. Drob, is a scholarly intellectual investigation of the Lurianic symbolism in the perspective of modern and postmodern intellectual thought. It seeks a "new kabbalah" rooted in the historical tradition through its academic study, but universalised through dialogue with modern philosophy and psychology. This approach seeks to enrich the secular disciplines, while uncovering intellectual insights formerly implicit in kabbalah's essential myth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkabbalah.com/index3.html |title=Kabbalah |publisher=New Kabbalah |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"By being equipped with the nonlinear concepts of dialectical, psychoanalytic, and deconstructive thought we can begin to make sense of the kabbalistic symbols in our own time. So equipped, we are today probably in a better position to understand the philosophical aspects of the kabbalah than were the kabbalists themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Drob, ''Symbols of the Kabbalah: Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives'', Jason Aronson publishers, p.xvi-xvii. Comparisons of the Lurianic scheme to Hegel, Freud and Jung are treated in respective chapters of Sanford Drob, ''Kabbalistic Metaphors: Jewish Mystical Themes in Ancient and Modern Thought'', Aronson. The modern disciplines are explored as particular intellectual/emotional perspectives into the inclusive supra-rational Lurianic symbolism, from which both emerge enriched&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Neo-Hasidic ===
From the early 20th century, Neo-Hasidism expressed a non-Orthodox Jewish interest in Jewish mysticism, becoming organisational among Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionalist Jewish denominations from the 1960s, through [[Jewish Renewal]] and the [[Chavurah]] movement. The writings and teachings of [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], Arthur Green, Lawrence Kushner, [[Herbert Weiner]] and others, has sought a Kabbalistic and Hasidic study and spirituality among modernist Jews. Arthur Green's translations from the religious writings of [[Hillel Zeitlin]] conceive the latter to be a precursor of contemporary neo-Hasidism.

=== Hasidic ===
Since the 18th century, Jewish mystical development has continued in Hasidic Judaism, turning kabbalah into a social revival with texts that internalise mystical thought. Among different schools, [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslav]] with related organisations, give outward looking spiritual resources and textual learning for secular Jews. The Intellectual Hasidism of Chabad most emphasises the spread and understanding of kabbalah through its explanation in Hasidic thought, articulating the Divine meaning within kabbalah through human rational analogies, uniting the spiritual and material, esoteric and exoteric in their Divine source:
{{quote|"Hasidic thought instructs in the predominance of spiritual form over physical matter, the advantage of matter when it is purified, and the advantage of form when integrated with matter. The two are to be unified so one cannot detect where either begins or ends, for 'the Divine beginning is implanted in the end and the end in the beginning' (Sefer Yetzira 1:7). The One God created both for one purpose&amp;nbsp;– to reveal the holy light of His hidden power. Only both united complete the perfection desired by the Creator."&lt;ref&gt;[[HaYom Yom]], Kehot publications, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Rav Kook ===
The writings of Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935), first chief rabbi of Mandate Palestine and visionary, incorporate kabbalistic themes through his own poetic language and concern with human and divine unity. His influence is in the [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] community, who follow his aim that the legal and imaginative aspects of Judaism should interfuse:
{{quote|"Due to the alienation from the 'secret of God' [i.e. Kabbalah], the higher qualities of the depths of Godly life are reduced to trivia that do not penetrate the depth of the soul. When this happens, the most mighty force is missing from the soul of nation and individual, and Exile finds favor essentially... We should not negate any conception based on rectitude and awe of Heaven of any form—only the aspect of such an approach that desires to negate the mysteries and their great influence on the spirit of the nation. This is a tragedy that we must combat with counsel and understanding, with holiness and courage."&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook (''Orot 2'')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Etymology and other names==
[[File:Lavra Kyiv.JPG|thumb|Panorama of the monastery (southward view)]]
[[Image:Uspensky Sobor.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The reconstructed Cathedral of the Dormition, as seen in 2005.]]
The word ''pechera'' means ''cave''. The word ''[[lavra]]'' is used to describe high-ranking male monasteries for monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the name of the monastery is also translated as Kiev Cave Monastery, Kiev Caves Monastery or the Kiev Monastery of the Caves (''на печерах'').

==Foundation and early history==
According to the [[Primary Chronicle]], in the early 11th century, [[Saint Anthony of Kiev|Anthony]], an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[monk]] from [[Esphigmenou Monastery|Esphigmenon monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]], originally from [[Liubech]] of the [[Principality of Chernigov|Principality of Chernihiv]], returned to [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and settled in Kiev as a [[missionary]] of monastic tradition to Kievan Rus'. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the [[Dnieper River]] and a community of disciples soon grew. [[Knyaz|Prince]] [[Iziaslav I of Kiev]] ceded the whole mount to the Antonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from [[Constantinople]].

==Buildings and structures==
The Kiev Pechersk Lavra contains numerous architectural monuments, ranging from [[bell tower]]s to cathedrals to cave systems and to strong stone [[Lavra fortification|fortification walls]]. The main attractions of the Lavra include the [[Great Lavra Belltower]], and the [[Cathedral of the Dormition (Pechersk Lavra)|Dormition Cathedral]], destroyed in [[World War II]], and fully reconstructed in recent years.{{when|date=September 2018}} Other churches and cathedrals of the Lavra include: the [[Refectory Church (Pechersk Lavra)|Refectory Church]], the Church of All Saints, the [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]], the Church of the Exaltation of Cross, the Church of the Trinity, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, the Church of the Conception of St. Anne, and the Church of the Life-Giving Spring. The Lavra also contains many other constructions, including: the St. Nicholas Monastery, the Kiev Theological Academy and Seminary, and the Debosquette Wall.

===Great Lavra Belltower===
{{main|Great Lavra Belltower}}

The Great Lavra Belltower is one of the most notable features of the Kiev skyline and among the main attractions of the Lavra. 96.5 meters in height, it was the tallest free-standing belltower at the time of its construction in 1731–1745, and was designed by the architect Johann Gottfried Schädel. It is a [[Classical architecture|Classical style]] construction and consists of [[storey|tier]]s, surmounted by a [[gilding|gilded]] [[dome]].

===Dormition Cathedral===
[[File:Успенський собор - Catedral de la ASuncion 2.jpg|thumb|Restored Dormition Church]]
Built in the 11th century, the main church of the monastery was destroyed during the [[World War II]] couple of months after the Nazi Germany troops occupied the city of [[Kiev]] and the controversial [[1941 Khreshchatyk explosions]] that destroyed the city's main street. According to the Soviet authorities, the temple was destroyed by the advancing German troops, while at the same time German authorities hanged the blame onto the withdrawing Soviet troops who did practiced the tactics of [[scorched earth]] and blew up all the Kiev bridges over [[Dnieper]] as well as being accused in the 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions.

It should be noted that since 1928 the monastery was converted into a museum park by the Soviet authorities and after its return no efforts were provided to restore the church. The temple was finally restored in 1995 after Ukraine obtained its independence and the construction was accomplished in two years. The new Dormition Church was consecrated in 2000.

===Gate Church of the Trinity===
{{main|Gate Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra)}}

The Gate Church of the Trinity is located atop the Holy Gates, which houses the entrance to the monastery. According to a legend, this church was founded by the [[Chernihiv]] [[Rulers of Kievan Rus'|Prince]] [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav II]]. It was built atop an [[Architecture of Kievan Rus'|ancient stone church]] which used to stand in its place.
After the fire of 1718 the church was rebuilt, its revered facades and interior walls enriched with ornate stucco work made by craftsman V. Stefaovych.
In the 18th century a new gilded pear-shaped dome was built, the facade and exterior walls were decorated with stucco-moulded plant ornaments and a vestibule built of stone attached to the north end. In the early 20th century the fronts and the walls flanking the entrance were painted by icon painters under the guidance of V. Sonin.
The interior of the Gate Trinity Church contains murals by the early 18th century painter Alimpy Galik.

===Refectory chambers with Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius===
{{main|Refectory Church (Pechersk Lavra)}}
[[File:Trapezna lavra.jpg|thumb|Refectory Church|right]]
The refectory chambers with the Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius is the third in a series of temples. The original temple was built in the 12th century and no drawings or visual depictions of it remain. The second temple was built at the time of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and was disassembled by the Russian authorities in the 19th century. It was replaced with the current temple, often referred to as the Refectory Church of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.

===The All Saints Church===
The All Saints Church erected in 1696–1698 is a fine specimen of Ukrainian baroque architecture. Characteristic of the church facades are rich architectural embellishments. In 1905 students of the Lavra art school painted the interior walls of the church. The carved wooden iconostasis is multi-tiered and was made for the All Saints church in the early 18th century.

===Church of the Saviour at Berestov===
{{main|Church of the Saviour at Berestove}}
[[Image:Church of the Saviour at Berestove (Side view).jpg|thumb|left|225px|Side view of the [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] seen with its [[campanile]], designed by architect Andrei Melenskyi in the [[Classical architecture|Classical style]].]]

The Church of the Saviour at Berestove is located to the North of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. It was constructed in the village of Berestove around the start of the 11th century during the reign of Prince [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Volodymyr Monomakh]]. It later served as the mausoleum of the Monomakh dynasty, also including [[Yuri Dolgoruki]], the founder of Moscow. Despite being outside the Lavra fortifications, the Church of the Saviour at Berestove is part of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra complex.

===Caves===
{{main|Near Caves}}
[[Image:Iliya Muromets Kiev.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Imperishable relic of saint [[Ilya Muromets]] in Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] 
The Kiev Pechersk Lavra caverns are a system of narrow underground corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk [[Saint Anthony of Kiev|Anthony]] settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is now the [[Far Caves]]. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the [[Near Caves]].

Foreign travellers in the 16th–17th centuries wrote that the catacombs of the Lavra stretched for hundreds of kilometres, reaching as far as Moscow and [[Velikiy Novgorod|Novgorod]],&lt;ref name="Touring Kyiv"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ruta | last=Malikenaite | year=2003 | title=Guidebook: Touring Kyiv | publisher=Baltia Druk | location=Kiev | isbn=966-96041-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; spreading awareness of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.

During the Soviet era, the bodies of the saints that lay in the caves were left uncovered due to the regime's disregard for religion. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the bodies were covered with a cloth and to this day remain in the same state. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

==Museum==
[[File:Orthodox pilgrim.jpg|thumb|200px|Orthodox pilgrim in Kiev Pechersk Lavra – women must cover their head when entering Lavra.]]
The Kiev Pechersk Lavra is one of the largest museums in Kiev. The exposition is the actual ensemble of the Upper ([[Near Caves]]) and Lower ([[Far Caves]]) Lavra territories, which house many architectural relics of the past. The collection within the churches and caves includes articles of precious metal, prints, higher clergy portraits and rare church hierarchy photographs. The main exposition contains articles from 16th to early 20th centuries, which include [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s, [[crucifix]]es, and textiles from 16th–19th centuries, with needlework and [[embroidery]] of Ukrainian masters. The remainder of the collection consists of pieces from the Lavra's Printing House and the Lavra's Icon Painting Workshop.&lt;ref name="Kyiv Sightseeing Guide"&gt;{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Kyiv Sightseeing Guide | publisher=Centre d'Europe | location=Kiev/Lviv | isbn=966-7022-29-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum provides tours of the [[catacombs]], which contain remains of Orthodox saints or their relics. The Caves are of geological interest because they are excavated into [[loess]] ground. They form one of the most extensive occurrences of loess caves in the world.

The Lavra museums include:

*[[Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine]]
**[[Martynivka Treasure]]
*[[Book and print history museum]]
*[[Museum of Ukrainian folk art]]
*[[Theater and film arts museum]]
*[[State historical library]]

'''Leopold Engel''' (b. April 19, 1858 – d. November 8, 1931) was a German writer and occultist.

==Early life==
Engel was born in [[St Petersburg]], [[Russia]].  His father was Karl Dietrich Engel (1824–1913), a violinist who in 1846 became Konzertmeister (leader) of the orchestra of the [[Imperial Russian Theatre]].

==Career==
Leopold Engel went to [[Germany]], finally settling in [[Dresden]] where he wrote extensively on the [[Faust legend]]. He became a follower of occultist [[Jakob Lorber]] (1800–1864) who wrote ten volumes of "inspired" teachings. In 1891 Engel himself heard an "inner voice" which commanded him to write an 11th volume of Lorber's work, ''[[The Great Gospel of John]]''.

During the 1890s he became involved with [[Theodor Reuss]] in reviving the [[Illuminati]] in Germany, setting up an irregular [[Freemasonry|masonic]] lodge which they called the Ludwig Lodge. This and several other lodges they were active in were not recognised by any of the regular German Grand Lodges. This association came to an end on July 3, 1903 with Engel's expulsion along with his friend Siegmund Miller.

==Death==
Leopold Engel died in 1931.

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] denominations are [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church bodies that identify, to a greater or lesser extent, with the [[Theology of Martin Luther|theology]] of [[Martin Luther]] and with the writings contained in the [[Book of Concord]]. Most Lutheran denominations are affiliated with one or more regional, national, or international associations, the largest of which—the [[Lutheran World Federation]]—has over 74 million members worldwide.&lt;ref name=LWF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/content/about-lwf|title=About the LWF|website=Lutheran World Federation|access-date=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two smaller and more conservative international associations—the [[International Lutheran Council]], with 7.15 million members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ilc-online.org/2018/09/26/ilc-welcomes-17-new-member-churches-representing-4-15-million-lutherans-worldwide/ |title=ILC welcomes 17 new member churches representing 4,15 million Lutherans worldwide |website=International Lutheran Council |first=Matthew |last=Block |date=26 September 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]], with approximately 500,000 members. Finally, the [[Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum]] (Global Forum) is a global gathering of [[Confessional Lutheran]] bodies who wish to emphasize [[missional]] discipleship as the focal point of ministry in the world.

'''The Lutheran Church in Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|An Eaglais Liútarach in Éirinn}}, {{lang-de|Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Irland}}) is a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church, operating across the island of [[Ireland]].

The Lutheran Church in Ireland maintains a special relationship with the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] and a majority of its members originally came from the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking countries and regions in Europe]]. In January 2015, a [[non-stipendiary priest]] was [[Ordination|ordained]] in Dublin by Frank Otfried July, the [[Landesbischof]] of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheran-ireland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=281:ordination-sauter&amp;catid=34:gemeindeleben&amp;Itemid=28|title=Die Ordination von Martin Sauter|date=10 January 2015|work=Gemeindeleben|publisher=Lutheran Church in Ireland|language=German|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother parish is located in [[Dublin]]. Although the services are mostly conducted in German, on the last Sunday of each month it is held in [[English language|English]]. Services in German also take place in [[Belfast]], [[Castlepollard]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Galway]], [[Killarney]], [[Limerick]], [[Sligo]] and [[Wexford]].

In 2009, it had a baptised membership of 300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821080424/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of La Vang''' ({{lang-vi|Đức Mẹ La Vang}}) refers to a reported [[Marian apparition]] at a time when [[Catholics]] were persecuted and killed in [[Vietnam]]. The Shrine of our Lady of La Vang (Basilica of Our Lady of La Vang) is situated in what is today Hai Phu commune in [[Hải Lăng District]] of [[Quảng Trị Province]] in Central Vietnam.

== History ==
Fearing the spread of Catholicism, the [[Nguyễn Quang Toản|Cảnh Thịnh]] [[Emperor of Vietnam|Emperor]] restricted the practice of Catholicism in the country in 1798. Soon thereafter, the emperor issued an anti-Catholic edict and persecution ensued.

Many people sought refuge in the rainforest of [[La Vang]] in Quảng Trị Province, Vietnam, and many became very ill. While hiding in the jungle, the community gathered every night at the foot of a tree to pray the rosary. One night, an apparition surprised them. In the branches of the tree a lady appeared, wearing the traditional Vietnamese ''[[áo dài]]'' dress and holding a child in her arms, with two angels beside her. The people present interpreted the vision as the Virgin Mary and the infant [[Jesus Christ]]. They said that [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] comforted them and told them to boil leaves from the trees for medicine to cure the illness. Legend states that the term "La Vang" was a derivative of the Vietnamese word meaning "crying out". Modern scholars believe it comes from the ancient practice of naming a location for a genus of a tree or plant native to the area, ''La'' meaning "leaf" and '"Vang'' "herbal seeds".

In 1802 the Christians returned to their villages, passing on the story of the apparition in La Vang and its message. As the story of the apparition spreads, many came to pray at this site and to offer incense. In 1820, a chapel was built.

From 1830-1885 another wave of persecutions decimated the Christian population, during the height of which the chapel in honour of Our Lady of La Vang was destroyed. In 1886, construction on a new chapel began. Following its completion, Bishop Gaspar (Loc) consecrated the chapel in honour of Our Lady Help of Christians, in 1901.

On December 8, 1954, the statue of Our Lady of La Vang was brought from Tri Bun back to the holy shrine. The Vietnamese Bishops Conference chose the church of Our Lady of La Vang as the National Shrine in honour of the Immaculate Conception. La Vang became the National Marian Center of Vietnam on April 13, 1961. [[Pope John XXIII]] elevated the Church of Our Lady of La Vang to the rank of a minor basilica on August 22, 1961.

Though there is no official Vatican recognition of this event as a Marian apparition, on June 19, 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] publicly recognized the importance of Our Lady of La Vang and expressed desire to rebuild the La Vang Basilica in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the first vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message of Pope John Paul II for the Conclusion of the Marian Year in La Vang, Viet Nam|url=http://www.rc.net/southwark/londonbridge-lasalette/Lavang.html#MESSAGE|website=Our Lady of La Salette and Saint Joseph Catholic Church|accessdate=9/11/15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901204309/http://www.rc.net/southwark/londonbridge-lasalette/lavang.html#MESSAGE|archivedate=2003-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the chapel of Our Lady of La Vang is now the Roman Catholic parish church and national shrine in [[Puerto Princesa City]] in [[Palawan]]. Our Lady of La Vang has become a patroness of Puerto Princesa and patroness of Palawan.

'''Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos''' (English: Our Lady of Saint John of the Lakes) is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Texas|Texan]] faithful.  The original image is a popular focus for pilgrims and is located in the state of [[Jalisco]], in central [[Mexico]], {{convert|122|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of the city of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]. The statue is venerated both in Mexico and the United States known by its proxy title '''Nuestra Señora de San Juan del Valle''' (Our Lady of Saint John of the Valley) mainly focused in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;''Mapping the Catholic cultural landscape'' by Richard Fossey 2004 {{ISBN|0-7425-3184-8}} page 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Globalizing the sacred: religion across the Americas'' by Manuel A. Vásquez, Marie F. Marquardt 2003 {{ISBN|0-8135-3285-X}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius X]] granted the image a [[Canonical coronation]] on 15 August 1904 and is widely known for the jeweled regalia offered by its devotees all throughout Mexico.  It is permanently enshrined at the Basilica Minor of [[San Juan de los Lagos]] and is one of the most visited [[pilgrimage]] [[shrine]]s in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Gitlitz &gt;''Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 {{ISBN|1-57607-004-2}} page 571&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sanctuary's history begins in 1543 when Father Miguel de Bologna, a [[Spain|Spanish]] priest, brought a statue of the Virgin of the [[Immaculate Conception]] to the village. The town was then called San Juan Mezquititlan Baptist but its name was changed to San Juan de Los Lagos in 1623.&lt;ref name=Gitlitz /&gt; According to local histories, and some eyewitness accounts, a certain aerial acrobat was traveling along the Camino Real, "the Royal Highway," from San Luis Potosí to Guadalajara, performing in the towns along the way. His act included his wife and two daughters. His stunts included swinging from one high point to another by means of ropes, in somewhat the same fashion as trapeze artists of today. To add excitement and an element of danger, the artists had to fly over swords and knives that were stuck in the ground with their points positioned upward.

While performing in the village, the younger daughter, a child of six or seven, slipped, fell upon the knives and was mortally wounded. After preparing the body and wrapping it in burial cloths, the grieving parents brought the child's body to the chapel of Our Lady of San Juan for burial.

Meeting them at the door of the chapel was the 78-year-old Ana Lucia, the wife of Pedro Antes (the caretaker and custodian of the beloved statue). Feeling pity for the grieving family, she exhorted them to have confidence in The Virgin, who could restore the child to them. Taking the statue from its altar in the sacristy where it had been consigned because of its poor condition, Ana Lucia laid it near the child's dead body. In a few moments, they detected a slight movement under the shroud. The parents quickly unwrapped the cloth to discover the child well and unharmed. This first miracle of Our Lady of San Juan de Los Lagos became known in neighboring villages and towns. Numerous other miracles and favors followed, until now Our Lady is venerated by pilgrims from throughout Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Miraculous Images of Our Lady" by Joan Carroll Cruz&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this miracle, the statue began to be venerated by an increasing number of pilgrims including Indians, Spanish and [[mestizos]]. During this period the statue acquired its own local identity as Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos. Between the early 17th century and the middle of the 19th century a pilgrimage fair was held each year on November 30 to celebrate the original installation of the statue in the [[shrine]].

==The Basilica==
[[File:1er Milagro.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Fresco]]The present church, begun in 1732, was built in the Mexican [[baroque]] style. The statue of the Virgin was installed in 1769 and the [[bell tower]]s were completed in 1790. In 1972 the church was recognized as a [[basilica]]. Inside the church, upon a platform with an upturned [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], stands the statue of the Virgin. The face is dark in color, the eyes widely spaced and the traits somewhat aquiline. 
About 20&amp;nbsp;inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, the statue was made by the [[Tarascan State]] of southern Mexico using an indigenous technique called titzingueni, in which a frame of wood is covered by a paste of corn pith and orchid juice, and then coated with [[gesso]] and painted. Similar statues are still venerated in other parts of [[Jalisco]], including many different of statue but different name such as Nuestra Señora de Los Altos (Our Lady of Los Altos) in town of Atotonilco El Alto and San Francisco de Asís, Jalisco.; Nuestra Señora de la Salud (Our Lady of Health) in Patzcuaro and the Virgin of Zapopan in the city of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]. Sometime in the late 16th or early 17th century the statue was modernized by being enclosed in a frame and draped with clothing. The Virgin’s hands are joined in prayer, she has long brown hair, and wears a white gown and blue robe. The statue’s body is covered with a golden crown in Byzantine style.
Above the image are two angels of silver, supporting between them a silver banner with the Latin inscription in blue enamel: Mater Immaculata ora pro nobis (Immaculate Mother pray for us).

==Pilgrimages, festivals and churches==
At the end of January and beginning of February each year a great pilgrimage occurs to the shrine and the city grows many times in size. This festival is attended by more than a million people, many of them walking, from all over [[Mexico]]. During a week of festivities there are hundreds of temporary stalls selling pilgrimage [[icons]], multiple bands of musicians playing around the great [[basilica]], fireworks demonstrations in the evenings, and a palpable feeling of spiritual joy descend on the town. If a family member falls ill or undergoes a serious surgery for example, you can promise the Virgin to make the pilgrimage if that person makes it out okay.

In the 1950's, the devotion spread to the [[Rio Grande Valley]] of [[Texas]]. A reproduction of the Mexican image is housed in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of San Juan del Valle]] in [[San Juan, Texas]]. This shrine is one of the largest Catholic sanctuaries in the state, and is known for its relationship with the migrant farm workers who still travel through this area of Texas.

The devotion carried over to California by people from Jalisco. In the 1970s, George Martinez revived the devotion in [[San Francisco, California]] and a monthly mass was celebrated. In 1979 Martinez convinced the bishop of San Juan to allow the statue to come to California, and the statue left Mexico for the  first time ever in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;''American congregations, Volume 2'' edited by James P. Wind, James Welborn Lewis 1995 {{ISBN|0-226-90186-6}} page 447&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion also arrived in [[New Mexico]] and the church of ''Nuestra Senor de los Lagos'' was built in 1828 in [[Taos County, New Mexico|Talpa, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historic New Mexico Churches'' by Annie Lux, Daniel Nadelbach 2007 {{ISBN|1-4236-0169-6}} page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical implication of such terms for [[Christology]] is thoroughly developed.

The work includes a number of quotations from standard authors such as the [[Cappadocians]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]], and also [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], but also from a number of authors condemned at various councils (e.g. [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinarius]], [[Eunomius]], [[Eutyches]], [[Nestorius]], [[Paul of Samosata]], [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]]).

Pamphilus is to be distinguished from the earlier [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], martyr and mentor of the encyclopaedic Christian apologist, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]

The '''Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti''' ({{lang-bn|পার্বত্য চট্টগ্রাম জনসংহতি সমিতি}}; ''United People's Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts''; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''PCJSS''') is a political party formed to represent the people and indigenous tribes of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] in Bangladesh. Since its inception in 1973, the PCJSS has fought for [[autonomy]] and the recognition of the ethnic identity and rights of the indigenous tribes of the Hill Tracts. Its military arm, the [[Shanti Bahini]] was used to fight government forces and [[Bengali people|Bengali]] settlers in the Hill Tracts. A [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace accord]] was signed in 1997 led to the disarmament of the Shanti Bahini and enabled the PCJSS to return to mainstream politics.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rashiduzzaman | first = M. |date=July 1998 | title = Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord: Institutional Features and Strategic Concerns | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 653–70 | publisher = [[University of California]] Press | jstor =2645754| doi = 10.1525/as.1998.38.7.01p0370e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CVX"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bangladesh peace treaty signed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/despatches/36256.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 December 1997 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chittagong marks peace anniversary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/226373.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 December 1998 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mohsin |first=Amena |year=2012 |chapter=Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, 1997 |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Hill_Tracts_Peace_Accord,_1997 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mochta"&gt;[http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205108/http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php |date=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The roots of the PCJSS can be traced to the Hill Tracts Students' Association and the [[Parbatya Chattagram Upajatiya Kalyan Samiti]] (United People's Welfare and Development Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts) that were organised in the 1960s in what was then-[[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="CV3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisations agitated on behalf of the 100,000 native peoples displaced by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]], seeking rehabilitation and compensation.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts such as the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politicians [[Charu Bikash Chakma]] and [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; Larma and others protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], although the Constitution recognised the ethnic identity but Larma and others wanted full sovereignty and separation from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;

{{cite book |author=Bushra Hasina Chowdhury |date=August 2002 |title=Building Lasting Peace: Issues of the Implementation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord |url=http://acdis.illinois.edu/assets/docs/264/BuildingLastingPeaceIssuesoftheImplementationoftheChittagongHillTractsAccord.pdf |publisher=Program in Arms Control, Disarmament, and International Security (ACDIS), [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government policy of recognised only the [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and the [[Bengali language]] and designating all citizens of Bangladesh as [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]. In talks with Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] insisted that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts adopt the Bengali identity.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt; Sheikh Mujib is also reported to have threatened to forcibly settle Bengalis in the Hill Tracts to reduce the native peoples into a minority.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shelley, Mizanur Rahman |title= The Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh: The untold story |publisher=Centre for Development Research, Bangladesh |year=1992 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four-point manifesto and foundation==
On 24 April 1972 Manabendra Narayan Larma presented a four-point manifesto&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; to the constitution drafting committee, which sought:&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt;

#[[Autonomy]] for the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the creation of its own [[Legislative Assembly]].
#Inclusion in the constitution of a statute like the Regulation of 1900 that safeguarded the identity and rights of the people of the Hill Tracts.
#Preservation of the positions of tribal chiefs and tribal customs and laws.
#Prohibition of amendments to the statute enshrining the Regulation of 1900 and the settlement of Bengalis in the Hill Tracts.

The manifesto was summarily rejected by the government, causing resentment and dissatisfaction amongst the people of the Hill Tracts.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; On 15 February 1973 representatives and activists of the Hill Tracts founded the Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Samhatti Samiti (PCJSS) under Manabendra Narayan Larma's leadership.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; The party's official aims and objectives included [[humanism]], nationalism, democracy, [[secularism]] and the protection of the rights, culture and ethnic identity, and autonomy for the tribes of the Hill Tracts.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; The PCJSS sought to unify and represent all the tribes of the Hill Tracts and also organised a committee of villages, a students and youth wing and a women's wing of the party.

==Insurgency==
Dissatisfaction and anger due to government opposition to their demands led the PCJSS to organise the Shanti Bahini (Peace forces) as [[Armed forces|military force]] to launch an armed struggle to win autonomy and secure the rights of the people of the Hill Tracts.&lt;ref name="ZV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nagendra K.

The PCJSS also rejected the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] and other government plans for local councils.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; After an insurgency that lasted for almost two decades, the PCJSS entered into peace talks with the government after the restoration of democracy in 1991. However, little progress was made with the government of prime minister [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] of the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], the daughter of Sheikh Mujib.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt; The peace accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.&lt;ref name="Mochta"/&gt; The peace accord provided for greater autonomy, the return of land to displaced tribals and special status for the ethnic groups and tribes. The accord also created a central ministry of tribal affairs and an elected regional council that would be empowered to govern the Hill Tracts and oversee local tribal councils. The accord also granted official recognition of the ethnic groups and tribes.

After the treaty was signed, Shanti Bahini insurgents formally laid down their arms and more than 50,000 displaced tribals were able to return to their homes. The PCJSS emerged as a mainstream political party.&lt;ref name="CV3"/&gt;

A '''Persian miniature'''  ([[Persian language|Persian]]:نگارگری ایرانی) is a small painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a ''[[muraqqa]]''.  The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Although there is an equally well-established Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums.  Miniature painting became a significant [[genre]] in [[Persian art]] in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the [[Mongol conquests]], and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries. The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this, and has many modern exponents.  The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the [[Ottoman miniature]] in Turkey, and the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] in the Indian sub-continent.

Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central.  This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The [[Qur'an]] and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting the Prophet Muhammed]], after 1500 usually without showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95-97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures, which this article concentrates on, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces.  In Islamic art this is referred to as "illumination", and manuscripts of the Qur'an and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.&lt;ref&gt;In the terminology of Western [[illuminated manuscript]]s, "illumination" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and [[Persian carpet]]s, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods miniatures were increasingly created as single works to be included in albums called [[muraqqa]], rather than illustrated books.  This allowed non-royal collectors to afford a representative sample of works from different styles and periods.

==Style==
[[File:Хафт ауранг Джами 1556-65 Фрир.jpg|thumb|left|Camp scene from late in the classic period, with no frame.  [[Layla and Majnun|Majnun]] (at top wearing orange) spies on his beloved Layla (standing in tent doorway)]]
The bright and pure colouring of the Persian miniature is one of its most striking features.  Normally all the [[pigment]]s used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or [[chiaroscuro]].  Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan.  Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or "cutaways" with exterior views of other parts of a facade.  Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-28; Welch, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Many figures are often depicted, with those in the main scene normally rendered at the same size, and recession (depth in the picture space) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space.  More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form.  The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn.  Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 44-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art.  Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 48-49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest miniatures appeared unframed horizontally across the page in the middle of text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings.  This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Saki - Reza Abbasi - Moraqqa’-e Golshan 1609 Golestan Palace.jpg|thumb|''Saki'', album miniature by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1609]]

The miniatures normally occupy a full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal "landscape" format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the picture area, which is enclosed in a frame, eventually  of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour.  The rest of the page is often decorated with dense designs of plants and animals in a muted ''[[grisaille]]'', often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders.  In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear on one side of the image, or be omitted completely.&lt;ref&gt;OAO (3, ii and elsewhere)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another later development was the album miniature, conceived as a single picture rather than a book illustration, though such images may be accompanied by short lyric poems. The withdrawal of Shah [[Tahmasp I]] from commissioning illustrated books in the 1540s probably encouraged artists to transfer to these cheaper works for a wider circle of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums or ''[[muraqqa]]s'' were assembled by collectors with album miniatures, specimen pages of calligraphy, and miniatures taken from older books, to which border paintings were often added when they were remounted.  Album miniatures usually showed a few figures on a larger scale, with less attention to the background, and tended to become drawings with some tints of coloured wash, rather than fully painted.

In the example at right the clothes are fully painted, and the background uses the gold grisaille style earlier reserved for marginal decoration, as in the miniature at the head of the article.  Many were individual portraits, either of notable figures (but initially rarely portraits of rulers), or of idealized beautiful youths. Others were scenes of lovers in a garden or picnics.  From about the middle of the 16th century these types of images became dominant, but they gradually declined in quality and originality and tended towards conventional prettiness and sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;OAO, Sims; Gray (1930), 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Books were sometimes refurbished and added to after an interval of many years, adding or partly repainting miniatures, changing the border decoration, and making other changes, not all improvements.&lt;ref&gt;OAO&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Conference of the Birds'' miniature in the gallery below is an addition of 1600 to a manuscript of over a century earlier, and elements of the style appear to represent an effort to match the earlier miniatures in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/63.210.11 Metropolitan Museum of Art] "The Conference of the Birds": Page from a manuscript of the Mantiq al-Tayr (The Language of the Birds) of Farid al-Din cAttar, [[Isfahan]] (63.210.11). In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000–.&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous painting ''Princes of the House of Timur'' was first painted in 1550-55 in Persia for the exiled Mughal prince [[Humayun]], who largely began the Mughal miniature tradition by taking back Persian miniaturists when he gained the throne.  It was then twice updated in India (c.1605 and 1628) to show later generations of the royal house.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jarilwala, 50-51; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4691/princes-of-the-house-of-timur Art Fund] with image.  The painting uses miniature techniques on cotton, and is much larger than most miniatures.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dimensions of the manuscripts covered a range not dissimilar to typical modern books, though with a more vertical ratio; many were as small as a modern paperback, others larger.  Shah Tamasp's ''Shahnameh'' stood 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, and one exceptional ''Shahnameh'' from [[Tabriz]] of c. 1585 stood 53&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref&gt;Uluc, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists and technique==
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|left|Complex palace scene, 1539–1543, [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]]] 
In the classic period artists were exclusively male, and normally grouped in workshops, of which the royal workshop (not necessarily in a single building) was much the most prestigious, recruiting talented artists from the [[bazaar]] workshops in the major cities. However the nature of the royal workshop remains unclear, as some manuscripts are recorded as being worked on in different cities, rulers often took artists with them on their travels, and at least some artists were able to work on private commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roxburgh (2000), 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Europe, sons very often followed their father into the workshop, but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited; at least one notable painter was born a slave. There were some highly placed amateur artists, including [[Shah Tahmasp I]] (reigned 1524–1576), who was also one of the greatest patrons of miniatures.  Persian artists were highly sought after by other Islamic courts, especially those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire]]s, whose own traditions of miniature were based on Persian painting but developed rather different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was often divided between the main painter, who drew the outlines, and less senior painters who coloured in the drawing.  In [[Mughal miniature]]s at least, a third artist might do just the faces.  Then there might be the border paintings; in most books using them these are by far the largest area of painted material as they occur on text pages as well.  The miniatures in a book were often divided up between different artists, so that the best manuscripts represent an overview of the finest work of the period.  The scribes or [[Calligraphy|calligraphers]] were normally different people, on the whole regarded as having a rather higher status than the artists - their names are more likely to be noted in the manuscript.

Royal librarians probably played a significant role in managing the commissions; the extent of direct involvement by the ruler himself is normally unclear.  The scribes wrote the main text first, leaving spaces for the miniatures, presumably having made a plan for these with the artist and the librarian.  The book covers were also richly decorated for luxury manuscripts, and when they too have figurative scenes these presumably used drawings by the same artists who created the miniatures.  Paper was the normal material for the pages, unlike the [[vellum]] normally used in Europe for as long as the illuminated manuscript tradition lasted.  The paper was highly polished, and when not given painted borders might be flecked with gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-26; Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique survival from the Timurid period, found "pasted inconspicuously" in a muraqqa in the [[Topkapi Palace]] is thought to be a report to Baysunghur from his librarian. After a brief and high-flown introduction, "Petition from the most humble servants of the royal library, whose eyes are as expectant of the dust from the hooves of the regal steed as the ears of those who fast are for the cry of ''[[Allahu akbar]]'' ..." it continues with very businesslike and detailed notes on what each of some twenty-five named artists, scribes and craftsmen has been up to over a period of perhaps a week: "Amir Khalil has finished the waves in two sea-scenes of the ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' and will begin to apply colour. ... All the painters are working on painting and tinting seventy-five tent-poles .... Mawlana Ali is designing a frontispiece illumination for the ''Shahnama''. His eyes were sore for a few days."&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from book arts, designs for tent-makers, tile-makers, woodwork and a saddle are mentioned, as is the progress of the "[[begum|begim]]'s little chest".&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44; a good number of those named are mentioned in other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Muhammad during the Mi'raj - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mi'raj]] (also called the "Night Ride") of Muhammed on [[Buraq]], Tabriz, 1307; Ilkhanid, with both Christian and Chinese influences, and horizontal format.]]

The ancient Persian religion of [[Manichaeism]] made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (c.216–276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the [[Arzhang]], was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text.  Unfortunately, the Islamic suppression of the religion was so thorough that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive.  These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how.  It is also known that [[Sassanid]] palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are narrative scenes in pottery, though it is hard to judge how these relate to lost contemporary book painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was also a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great period of the Persian miniature began when Persia was ruled by a succession of foreign dynasties, who came from the east and north. The traumatic [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]] of [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|1219]] onwards established the [[Ilkhanate]] as a branch of the [[Mongol Empire]], and despite the huge destruction of life and property, the new court had a galvanising effect on book painting, importing many Chinese works and probably artists, with their long-established tradition of narrative painting. The Ilkhanids continued to migrate between summer and winter quarters, which together with other travels for war, hunting and administration, made the portable form of the illustrated book the most suitable vehicle for painting, as it also was for mobile European medieval rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Great Mongol Shahnameh]], now dispersed, is the outstanding manuscript of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1335 the Ilkhanate split into several warring dynasties, all swept aside by the new invasion of [[Timur]] from 1381. He established the [[Timurid dynasty]], bringing a fresh wave of Chinese influence, who were replaced by the [[Black Sheep Turkmen]] in 1452, followed by the [[White Sheep Turkmen]] from 1468, who were in turn replaced by the [[Safavid dynasty]] by 1501; they ruled until 1722.  After a chaotic period [[Nader Shah]] took control, but there was no long-lived dynasty until the [[Qajar dynasty]], who ruled from 1794 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 309-315, OAO; Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baysunghur's Shahname 001.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baysonghor Shahnameh]], 1430. He was a key patron of the [[Herat]] school]]

It was only in the 14th century that the practice began of commissioning illustrated copies of classic works of [[Persian poetry]], above all the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]] (940-1020) and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', which were to contain many of the finest miniatures.  Previously book illustration, of works in both Arabic and Persian, had been concentrated in practical and scientific treatises, often following at several removes the Byzantine miniatures copied when ancient Greek books were translated.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  However a 14th-century flowering of Arabic illustrated literary manuscripts in Syria and Egypt collapsed at the end of the century, leaving Persia the undisputed leader in Islamic book illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the best miniatures from early manuscripts were removed from their books in later centuries and transferred to albums, several of which are now in [[Istanbul]]; this complicates tracing the art history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Simms&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures from the Safavid and later periods are far more common than earlier ones, but although some prefer the simpler elegance of the early 15th and 16th centuries, most art historians agree in seeing a rise in quality up to the mid-16th century, culminating in a series of superb royal commissions by the Safavid court, such as the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]] (or Houghton Shahnameh). There was a crisis in the 1540s when Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a patron on a large scale, ceased to commission works, apparently losing interest in painting.  Some of his artists went to the court of his nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]], governor of [[Mashad]] from 1556, where there was a brief flowering of painting until the Shah fell out with his nephew in 1565, including a ''[[Haft Awrang]]'', the "Freer Jami".  Other artists went to the Mughal court.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 103; Welch (mostly on Freer Jami after p. 24), 23-27, 31, 98-127; [http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/loveYearning/base.html Freer Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this the number of illustrated book manuscript commissions falls off, and the tradition falls into over-sophistication and decline.&lt;ref&gt;OAO; Gray (1930), 74-89; Welch, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tabriz]] in the north-west of Iran is the longest established centre of production, and [[Baghdad]] (then under Persian rule) was often important. [[Shiraz]] in the south, sometimes the capital of a sub-ruler, was a centre from the late 14th century, and [[Herat]], now in [[Afghanistan]], was important in the periods when it was controlled from Persia, especially when the Timurid prince [[Baysonqor]] was governor in the 1420s; he was then the leading patron in Persia, commissioning the [[Baysonghor Shahnameh]] and other works.  Each centre developed its own style, which were largely reconciled and combined under the Safavids.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 37-55; Welch, 14-18; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of Herat, where the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] royal workshops usually were, had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, a more expressive and imaginative style.  Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, and in the early [[Safavid]] period the styles were gradually harmonized in works like the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 80; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420-424&lt;/ref&gt;  But a famous unfinished miniature showing [[Rustam]] asleep, while his horse [[Rakhsh]] fights off a lion, was probably made for this manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Bizhad]].  It is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese influences==
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]] of the Prophet by Sultan Muhammad, showing  Chinese-influenced clouds and angels, 1539-43.&lt;ref&gt;see Welch, 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before Chinese influence was introduced, figures were tied to the ground line and included "backgrounds of solid color", or in "clear accordance with indigenous artistic traditions". However, once influenced by the Chinese, Persian painters gained much more freedom through the Chinese traditions of "unrestricted space and infinite planes". Much of the Chinese influence in Persian art is probably indirect, transmitted through Central Asia. There appear to be no Persian miniatures that are clearly the work of a Chinese artist or one trained in China itself. The most prestigious Chinese painting tradition, of ''literati'' [[landscape painting]] on scrolls, has little influence; instead the closest parallels are with wall-paintings and motifs such as clouds and dragons found in Chinese pottery, textiles, and other decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The format and composition of the Persian miniature received strong influence from Chinese paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz and Desai, 172; Meri, 585&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ilkhanid rulers did not convert to Islam for several decades, meanwhile remaining [[Tantric Buddhist]]s or Christians (usually [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]]s).  While very few traces now remain, Buddhist and Christian images were probably easily available to Persian artists at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in Ilkhanid and Timurid [[Mongol]]-[[Persian people|Persian]] mythological miniatures,  mythical beasts were portrayed in a style close to the Chinese [[qilin]], [[fenghuang]] ([[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]), [[bixie]] and [[Chinese dragon]], though they have a much more aggressive character in Islamic art, and are often seen fighting each other or natural beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 169-173&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent Persian miniaturists ==
The workshop tradition and division of labour within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings.  Some are inscribed with the name of the artist, sometimes as part of the picture itself, for example as if painted on tiles in a building, but more often as a note added on the page or elsewhere; where and when being often uncertain.  Because of the nature of the works, literary and historical references to artists, even if they are relied upon, usually do not enable specific paintings to be identified, though there are exceptions.  The reputation of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād Herawī]], or Behzād, the leading miniaturist of the late Timurid era, and founder of the Safavid school, remained supreme in the [[Persianate]] world, and at least some of his work, and style, can be identified with a degree of confidence, despite a good deal of continuing scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 57-66; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sultan Mohammed]], [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], and [[Aqa Mirak]], were leading painters of the next generation, the Safavid culmination of the classic style, whose attributed works are found together in several manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 17-27, and many individual pictures shown&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abd al-Samad]] was one of the most successful Persian painters recruited by the [[Mughal Emperor]]s to work in India.  In the next generation, [[Reza Abbasi]] worked in the Late Safavid period producing mostly album miniatures, and his style was continued by many later painters.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the miniatures of Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari ([[Sani ol molk]]), active in [[Qajar]] Persia, showed originality, naturalism, and technical perfection.&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Robinson, “[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abul-hasan-khan-gaffari-sani-al-molk-1814-66-painter-in-oils-and-miniature-lacquer-artist-and-book-illustrator Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari],” Encyclopædia Iranica, I/3, pp. 306-308&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mahmoud Farshchian]] is a contemporary miniaturist whose style has broadened the scope of this art.

Chronicle of the Pharaohs the Reign-by-reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; although the actual term "Pharaoh" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until [[Merneptah]], c. 1200 BCE. In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|three titles]], the Horus, the [[prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|Sedge and Bee]] ([[wikt:nswt-bjtj|''nswt-bjtj'']]) name, and the Two Ladies ([[wikt:nbtj|''nbtj'']]) name. The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added.

In Egyptian society, [[ancient Egyptian religion|religion]] was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people. The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods; his role was both as civil and religious administrator. He owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/pharaoh/home.html |title=Pharaoh |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1999 |website=AncientEgypt.co.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religiously, the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. He was responsible for maintaining [[Maat]] ([[wikt:mꜣꜥt#Egyptian|mꜣꜥt]]), or cosmic order, balance, and justice, and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat, such as to obtain resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/pharaoh/ |title=Pharaoh - Ancient History Encyclopedia |last=Mark |first=Joshua |date=2 September 2009 |website=ancient.eu |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early days prior to the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]], the [[Deshret]] or the "Red Crown", was a representation of the Kingdom of Lower Egypt, while the [[Hedjet]], the "White Crown", was worn by the kings of the kingdom of upper Egypt. After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt, the [[Pschent]], the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings. With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the [[Khat (apparel)|Khat]], [[Nemes]], [[Atef]], [[Hemhem crown]], and [[Khepresh]]. At times, it was depicted that a combination of these headdresses or crowns would be worn together.

==Etymology==
The word ''pharaoh'' ultimately derives from the [[Egyptian language#History|Egyptian]] compound ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:pr ꜥꜣ|pr ꜥꜣ]]}}'', {{ipa|/ˌpaɾuwˈʕaʀ/}} "great house", written with the two [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral hieroglyphs]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[pr (hieroglyph)|pr]]}}'' "house" and ''{{lang|egy-Latn|ꜥꜣ}}'' "column", here meaning "great" or "high". It was used only in larger phrases such as ''[[wikt:smr#Etymology 1|smr]] pr-ꜥꜣ'' "Courtier of the High House", with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gardiner, ''Ancient Egyptian Grammar'' (3rd edn, 1957), 71–76.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] onward, the word appears in a wish formula "Great House, May it [[Ankh wedja seneb|Live, Prosper, and be in Health]]", but again only with reference to the royal palace and not the person.

During the reign of [[Thutmose III]] (c. 1479–1425 BCE) in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], after the foreign rule of the [[Hyksos]] during the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], ''pharaoh'' became the form of address for a person who was king.&lt;ref&gt;Redmount, Carol A. "Bitter Lives: Israel in and out of Egypt". p.&amp;nbsp;89–90. Michael D. Coogan, ed. ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'', [[Oxford University Press]]. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest instance where ''pr ꜥꜣ'' is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to [[Akhenaten]], who reigned c. 1353–1336 BCE, which is addressed to "Great House, May it Live, Prosper, and be in Health".&lt;ref&gt;''Hieratic Papyrus from Kahun and Gurob'', F. LL. Griffith, 38, 17. Although see also R. Mond and O. Myers (1940), ''Temples of Armant'', pl. 93, 5, for an instance possibly dating from the reign of [[Thutmose III]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (16th to 14th centuries BCE) the title pharaoh was employed as a [[deference|reverential designation]] of the ruler. About the late [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] (10th century BCE), however, instead of being used alone as before, it began to be added to the other titles before the ruler's name, and from the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Fifth Dynasty]] (eighth to seventh centuries BCE) it was, at least in ordinary usage, the only [[epithet]] prefixed to the royal appelative.&lt;ref&gt;"pharaoh" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Ultimate Reference Suite''. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|nineteenth dynasty]] onward ''pr-ꜥꜣ'' on its own was used as regularly as '''''[http://medu.ipetisut.com/index.php?og=majesty ḥm]''''', "Majesty".&lt;ref name="Denise M. Doxey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doxey|first=Denise M.|authorlink=Denise M. Doxey|title=Egyptian Non-Royal Epithets in the Middle Kingdom: A Social and Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jead15xcBQC&amp;pg=PA119|year=1998|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11077-1|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="note"|The Bible refers to Egypt as the "Land of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]".}} The term, therefore, evolved from a word specifically referring to a building to a respectful designation for the ruler, particularly by the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Second Dynasty]] and [[Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-third Dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

For instance, the first dated appearance of the title pharaoh being attached to a ruler's name occurs in Year 17 of [[Siamun]] on a fragment from the [[Karnak]] Priestly Annals. Here, an induction of an individual to the Amun priesthood is dated specifically to the reign of Pharaoh [[Siamun]].&lt;ref&gt;J-M. Kruchten, Les annales des pretres de Karnak (OLA 32), 1989, pp. 474–478.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new practice was continued under his successor [[Psusennes II]] and the Twenty-second Dynasty kings. For instance, the Large Dakhla stela is specifically dated to Year 5 of king "Pharaoh Shoshenq, beloved of [[Amun]]", whom all Egyptologists concur was [[Shoshenq I]]—the founder of the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]]—including [[Alan Gardiner]] in his original 1933 publication of this stela.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Gardiner, "The Dakhleh Stela", ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'', Vol. 19, No. 1/2 (May, 1933) pp. 193–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoshenq I was the second successor of Siamun. Meanwhile, the old custom of referring to the sovereign simply as ''pr-ˤ3'' continued in traditional Egyptian narratives.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

By this time, the [[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]] word is reconstructed to have been pronounced {{IPA|*[parʕoʔ]}} whence Herodotus derived the name of one of the Egyptian kings, {{lang-grc-koi|Φερων}}.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Histories 2.111.1. See {{cite book | publisher=Brill| year=1972 |title=Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary |author=Anne Burton}}, commenting on ch. 59.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the title also occurs as {{lang-he|פרעה}} {{IPA|[parʕoːh]}};&lt;ref name="Pharaoh פרעה"&gt;[http://arilipinski.com/pesach-haggadah-abravanel-comment-explained-by-ari-lipinski/ Elazar Ari Lipinski: "Pesach – A holiday of questions. About the Haggadah-Commentary Zevach Pesach of Rabbi Isaak Abarbanel (1437–1508).] Explaining the meaning of the name Pharaoh." Published first in German in the official quarterly of the Organization of the Jewish Communities of Bavaria: ''Jüdisches Leben in Bayern. Mitteilungsblatt des Landesverbandes der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinden in Bayern.'' Pessach-Ausgabe Nr. 109, 2009, {{ZDB|2077457-6}}, S. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; from that, in the [[Septuagint]], {{lang-grc-koi|φαραώ|pharaō}}, and then in [[Late Latin]] ''pharaō'', both ''-n'' stem nouns. The [[Qur'an]] likewise spells it {{lang-ar|فرعون}} ''firꜥawn'' with ''n'' (here, always referring to the one evil king in the [[Book of Exodus]] story, by contrast to the good king Aziz in [[Yusuf (surah)|surah Yusuf]]'s story). The Arabic combines the original [[ayin]] from Egyptian along with the ''-n'' ending from Greek.

English at first spelled it "Pharao", but the King James Bible revived "Pharaoh" with "h" from the Hebrew. Meanwhile in Egypt itself, {{IPA|*[par-ʕoʔ]}} evolved into [[Coptic language|Sahidic Coptic]] {{coptic|ⲡⲣ̅ⲣⲟ}} ''pərro'' and then ''ərro'' by mistaking ''p-'' as the [[definite article]] "the" (from ancient Egyptian ''[[wikt:pꜣ|pꜣ]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Till: "Koptische Grammatik". ''VEB Verläg Enzyklopädie'', Leipzig, 1961. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable epithets are ''[[wikt:nswt|nswt]]'', translated to "king"; ''[[wikt:jty|jty]]'' for "monarch or sovereign"; ''[[wikt:nb|nb]]'' for "lord";&lt;ref name="Denise M. Doxey"/&gt;{{refn|group="note"|nb.f means "his lord", the monarchs were introduced with (.f) for his, (.k) for your.&lt;ref name="Denise M. Doxey"/&gt;}} and ''[[wikt:ḥqꜣ|ḥqꜣ]]'' for "ruler".

==Regalia==

===Scepters and staves===
[[File:Khasekhemwy-BeadedScepter MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|Beaded scepter of Khasekhemwy (Museum of Fine Arts in Boston).]]
[[Sceptre]]s and staves were a general sign of authority in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="TW158"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest royal scepters was discovered in the tomb of [[Khasekhemwy]] in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].&lt;ref name="TW158"/&gt; Kings were also known to carry a staff, and Pharaoh [[Anedjib]] is shown on stone vessels carrying a so-called ''mks''-staff.&lt;ref name="TW159"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The scepter with the longest history seems to be the ''heqa''-sceptre, sometimes described as the shepherd's crook.&lt;ref name="TW160"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest examples of this piece of regalia dates to [[prehistoric Egypt]]. A scepter was found in a tomb at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] that dates to [[Naqada III]].

Another scepter associated with the king is the [[was-sceptre|''was''-sceptre]].&lt;ref name="TW160"/&gt; This is a long staff mounted with an animal head. The earliest known depictions of the ''was''-scepter date to the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]. The ''was''-scepter is shown in the hands of both kings and deities.

The [[flail]] later was closely related to the ''heqa''-scepter (the [[crook and flail]]), but in early representations the king was also depicted solely with the flail, as shown in a late pre-dynastic knife handle which is now in the Metropolitan museum, and on the [[Narmer Macehead]].&lt;ref name="TW161"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Uraeus===
The earliest evidence known of the [[Uraeus]]—a rearing cobra—is from the reign of [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]] from the First Dynasty. The cobra supposedly protected the pharaoh by spitting fire at its enemies.&lt;ref name="TW162"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deshret===
The red crown of Lower Egypt, the [[Deshret]] crown, dates back to pre-dynastic times and symbolised chief ruler. A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from [[Naqada]], and later, [[Narmer]] is shown wearing the red crown on both the [[Narmer Macehead]] and the [[Narmer Palette]].

===Hedjet===
The white crown of Upper Egypt, the [[Hedjet]], was worn in the Predynastic Period by [[Scorpion II]], and, later, by Narmer.

===Pschent===
This is the combination of the Deshret and Hedjet crowns into a double crown, called the [[Pschent]] crown. It is first documented in the middle of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The earliest depiction may date to the reign of [[Djet]], and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den.&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-415-26011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khat===
[[File:Den1.jpg|thumb|right|Den]]
The [[Khat (apparel)|''khat'']] headdress consists of a kind of "kerchief" whose end is tied similarly to a [[ponytail]]. The earliest depictions of the ''khat'' headdress comes from the reign of Den, but is not found again until the reign of [[Djoser]].

===Nemes===
The [[Nemes]] headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of crown that has been depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown, apart from the Khat headdress, has been commonly depicted on top of the [[Nemes]]. The statue from his [[Serdab]] in [[Saqqara]] shows the king wearing the ''nemes'' headdress.&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

===Atef===
Osiris is shown to wear the [[Atef]] crown, which is an elaborate [[Hedjet]] with feathers and disks. Depictions of Pharaohs wearing the [[Atef]] crown originate from the Old Kingdom.

===Hemhem===
The [[Hemhem crown]] is usually depicted on top of [[Nemes]], [[Pschent]], or [[Deshret]] crowns. It is an ornate triple [[Atef]] with corkscrew sheep horns and usually two uraei. The usage (depiction) of this crown begins during the Early 18th dynasty of Egypt.

===Khepresh===
Also called the blue crown, the [[Khepresh]] crown has been depicted since the New Kingdom.

===Physical evidence===
Egyptologist [[Bob Brier]] has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, discovered largely intact, did contain such regalia as his [[crook and flail]], but no crown was found among the funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Garry J. ''The Pharaoh, Life at Court and on Campaign''. Thames and Hudson, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;21, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties. Brier's speculation is that crowns were religious or state items, so a dead pharaoh likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brier, ''The Murder of Tutankhamen'', 1998, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles==
{{main|Ancient Egyptian royal titulary}}
During the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic period]] kings had three titles. The [[Horus]] name is the oldest and dates to the late pre-dynastic period. The ''Nesu Bity'' name was added during the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The ''Nebty'' name was first introduced toward the end of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]].&lt;ref name="TW" /&gt; The Golden falcon (''bik-nbw'') name is not well understood. The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a [[Cartouche (hieroglyph)|cartouche]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; By the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the official [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|titulary]] of the ruler consisted of five names; Horus, nebty, golden Horus, nomen, and prenomen&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford University Press 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;477&lt;/ref&gt; for some rulers, only one or two of them may be known.

===''Nesu Bity'' name===
The ''Nesu Bity'' name, also known as [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|Prenomen]], was one of the new developments from the reign of [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]]. The name would follow the glyphs for the "Sedge and the Bee". The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The ''nsw bity'' name may have been the birth name of the king. It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists.&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

===Horus name===
The Horus name was adopted by the king, when taking the throne. The name was written within a square frame representing the palace, named a [[serekh]]. The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king [[Ka (pharaoh)|Ka]], before the first dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Toby A. H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;57f.&lt;/ref&gt; The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with [[Horus]]. [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] refers to "Horus the fighter", [[Djer]] refers to "Horus the strong", etc. Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names. [[Khasekhemwy]] refers to "Horus: the two powers are at peace", while [[Nebra (Pharaoh)|Nebra]] refers to "Horus, Lord of the Sun".&lt;ref name="TW" /&gt;

===''Nebty'' name===
The earliest example of a ''nebty'' name comes from the reign of king [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] from the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt [[Nekhbet]] and [[Wadjet]].&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; The title is preceded by the vulture (Nekhbet) and the cobra (Wadjet) standing on a basket (the neb sign).&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

===Golden Horus===
The Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or ''nbw'' sign. The title may have represented the divine status of the king. The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the [[Egyptian pyramids#Pyramid symbolism|pyramid]]s and [[obelisk]]s are representations of (golden) [[sun]]-rays. The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt, the city of Set. This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set.&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

===Nomen and prenomen===
The [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|prenomen]] and [[Nomen (ancient Egypt)|nomen]] were contained in a cartouche. The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (''nsw bity'') or Lord of the Two Lands (''nebtawy'') title. The prenomen often incorporated the name of [[Ra|Re]]. The nomen often followed the title Son of Re (''sa-ra'') or the title Lord of Appearances (''neb-kha'').&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

'''Rayi Ratna Sundara Rao''' (born 1934; died 1992&lt;ref name="Rayi"&gt;Rayi Ministries.  [http://rayiministries.hpage.co.in/about-us_51244704.html Rayi Ratna Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prolific writer, theologian and [[comparative religion]] scholar who once served as the principal of the [[Gurukul Lutheran Theological College]], [[Chennai]], affiliated to the nation's first&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001790/179035eb.pdf UNESCO Structures of University Education in India, 1952]&lt;/ref&gt; university, the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]].

Some of the writings of Sundara Rao are kept in digitized versions at the [[National Library of India]]&lt;ref name="Bhakti"/&gt; and  the [[Indian Institute of Science]].&lt;ref name="Babalu"/&gt;

In a recent 2014 study by Katherine C. Zubko of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]],  Zubko highlights that Sundara Rao's assumption of [[Bhakti]] was a more inward expression for concern for others cutting across religious boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine C. Zubko, ''Dancing Bodies of Devotion: Fluid Gestures in Bharata Natyam'', Lexington Books, Plymouth, 2014, p.86.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GrZKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=r.r.sundara+rao&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-lMS-06aN-&amp;sig=Zkj9TjjJHo9w0TUWYgQmGGF7roc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwB2oVChMI_JPj5-PqyAIVwhiUCh3m-QTu#v=onepage&amp;q=r.r.sundara%20rao&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Sundara Rao's treatise, ''Bhakti Theology in the Telugu Hymnal'' had struck new ground in finding out the origins of [[Bhakti]] element in Christian Hymns in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].  The Missiologist, [[Roger E. Hedlund]] asserted that along with the [[Bible]], the Christian Hymnal in Telugu also formed the main bulwark of Christian spiritual life for the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] folk and of equal use to both the non-literates and the literates as well.&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Hedlund, Quest for Identity: India's Churches of Indigenous origin: The "Little" Tradition in Indian Christianity, New Delhi, 2000, p.261. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W3sGM-wp1msC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=andhra+christian+hymnal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CcyYVaCtJcSdugSGmqo4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a setting of the importance of the Telugu Hymnal, Sundara Rao's study reiterated&lt;ref&gt;James Elisha Taneti, ''History of the Telugu Christians: A Bibliography'', Scarecrow/ATLA, Toronto, 2011, p.11.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W1xAHHzUbNsC&amp;q=sundara+rao#v=snippet&amp;q=sundara%20rao&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that [[Bhakti]] had been a binding factor for the early Christians in the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  While this has been so, new studies in 2014 by [[Harvard]]-Scholars, Ch. Vasantha Rao and John B. Carman indicate that the element of [[Bhakti]] had not done much inroads into the otherwise rural India which in their study wholly depended on folk element.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Carman, Chilkuri Vasantha Rao, Christians in South Indian Villages 1959-2009, Decline and Revival in Telangana, Eerdmans Publishing, Cambridge, 2014, pp.68-71.

==Studies==
Sundara Rao had his ministerial formation at the Lutheran Theological College, Rajahmundry, affiliated to the nation's first&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; University, the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]], under the Principalship of [[William D. Coleman (Pastor)]].  Sundara Rao later upgraded his academics by pursuing a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree.&lt;ref name="Babalu"/&gt;  Sundara Rao was awarded a degree by the University during the Registrarship of [[Chetti Devasahayam]].

For language studies, Sundara Rao enrolled for a graduate and postgraduate programme in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] at the [[Andhra University]] and the [[Venkateshwara University]] which awarded him with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Master of Arts]] respectively.  Sundara Rao also researched from 1976 to 1980&lt;ref name="Babalu"/&gt; at the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Madison Wisconsin|Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Galveston Daily, News from Galveston, Texas'', 12 January 1980, page 9.  [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/12954157/]&lt;/ref&gt; submitting a dissertation in 1981 entitled ''The bhakti element in Āndhra Kraistava Kīrtanalu : an intensive study of the phenomenon of bhakti, a Sanskrit word for devotion, as presented in the Telugu Christian Hymnal''&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Sundara Rao, ''The bhakti element in Āndhra Kraistava Kīrtanalu : an intensive study of the phenomenon of bhakti, a Sanskrit word for devotion, as presented in the Telugu Christian Hymnal'', University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1981.  [https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_bhakti_element_in_%C4%80ndhra_Kraistava.html?id=SnvUAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical career==
Sundara Rao was a Pastor of the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society and ministered in congregations until his appointment as Lecturer in 1973&lt;ref name="Babalu"/&gt; at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad]] where he taught in an [[ecumenical]] setting with other [[Protestant]] congregations.  In fact, the Lutheran Theological College, [[Rajahmundry]] in which Sundara Rao had his ministerial formation amalgamated itself in 1964 into [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], a [[special purpose entity]] which comprised four existing Seminaries,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4113">'''Rasa''' ([[IAST]] {{IAST|rasa}}) refers to the creation and reception of a distinct 'flavor' or quality of something. As a [[Sanskrit]] theological concept, rasa was popularized by specific to [[Krishna]]-centered [[bhakti]] traditions, such as [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] from the fifteenth century. The theological use of the word can be found early, about two thousand years before the [[Nimbarka]] or [[Caitanya]] schools of bhakti, in a phrase that Chaitanya  traditions frequently quote: "Truly, the Lord is ''rasa''" (''raso vai sah'') of the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] (2.7.1). This statement expresses the view that God is the one who enjoys the ultimate rasa, or spiritual rapture and emotions.&lt;ref name="Schweig 2005 79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed [[Rupa Goswami]] developed, under the direct guidance of Caitanya, the articulated and formulated theology of rasa as "the soul's particular relationship with the divinity in devotional love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupa's text draws largely from the foundational theory of rasa formed by [[Bharata Muni]], the originator of [[Sanskrit]] [[dramaturgy]], or ''[[Natya Sastra]]'' (perhaps as early as the 2nd century BCE).&lt;ref name="Schweig 2005 79"/&gt; These relationships with the divinity in devotional love, rasa, can closely resemble the variety of loving feelings that humans experience with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master-servant.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|pages=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasas are distinguished as lower and higher and according to [[Bhagavad Gita]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 11:44&lt;/ref&gt; it appears that the three higher rasas are acknowledged and preferred by [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher ''rasas'' are described as loving, friendly, and fraternal types of relationships.


==Rasa Lila dance==
In the tradition of [[Vaishnavism of Manipur]], the [[Rasa Lila]] is depicted within [[Manipuri dance|classic Manipuri dance]], and revolves around the same story of the love between Krishna and the cowherd girls and tells the divine love story of Krishna, [[svayam bhagavan]] and [[Radha]], his divine beloved. This form of dance was started by [[Bhagya Chandra]] in 1779 and in some parts of India is still performed every year on [[Krishna Janmashtami]] (the festival to celebrate Krishna's ''birthday''). According to different traditions, the rasa-lila is performed either by boys and girls, or by boys only. The dance is performed holding ''dandi'' (sticks) and is often accompanied with folk songs and [[Bhajan|devotional music]].

The '''Sadgop''' sub-caste is a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Hindu]] [[Yadav]] [[caste]], found in [[West Bengal]],  [[Odisha]], [[Jharkhand]] and parts of [[Bihar]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 827 to 831 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==

The Sadgop derive their name from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'sad' meaning good and 'gopa' meaning a milkman. They claim to be descendants of the [[Hindu]] god [[Krishna]]. According to chronicles, many members have adopted [[Hinduism]] in the 11th century during [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] after the [[Kurukshetra War]] and remaining members adopted Hinduism in the 15th century during [[Kamarupa Kingdom]]. Gaya and Vrindaban are their pilgrim centers. The Sadgop are divided into two groups, the Kulin and Mulika, with the former further sub-divided into the eastern and western Kulin. The western Kulin live in [[West Bengal]], and are further sub-divided into the [[Ghosh]] and Sarhesia. The eastern Kulin left [[Midnapur]] in West Bengal, some part of [[East Bengal]] and moved to [[Bihar]]. The Sadgop speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]] but those of Bihar speak [[Hindi]] as well.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; 

By the 1910, Sadgop along with other synonymous communities like [[Ahir]], Gop and Gopal became part of articulated Yadav movement who claim their descent from ancient [[Yadu]] lineage of Krishna.&lt;ref name="Pinch1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=William R. Pinch|title=Peasants and Monks in British India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC|accessdate=9 July 2017|date=18 June 1996|publisher=University of California Press|language=en|isbn=978-0-520-91630-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Sadgop consist of a number of sub-divisions. They are an endogamous group and practice [[gotra]] exogamy. The Sadgop are mainly a landholding community, but many Sadgop have settled in [[Kolkata]] and other cities of West Bengal. Their own community organization is named as Bangiya Sadgop Samiti.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

'''Sarvajña''' ([[Kannada]]: {{lang|kn|'''ಸರ್ವಜ್ಞ'''}}) was a [[Kannada]] poet, [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] and philosopher of the 16th century. The word "Sarvajna" in Sanskrit literally means "the all knowing". He is famous for his pithy three-lined poems called ''[[tripadi]]'' (written in the native three-line verse metre, "with three [[pada (foot)|pada]]s, a form of ''[[Vachanas|Vachana]]'').  He is also referred as '''Sarvagna''' in modern translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ಕವಿ ಸರ್ವಜ್ಞ (Poet Sarvajna)|url=http://kanaja.in/?p=14749|website=kanaja.in , [[Kanaja]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on studies of his literary style and the references by later writers, historians estimate that he may have lived during the first half of the 16th century. Some references in his works indicate that his real name was '''Pushpadatta''' - Sarvajña appears to have been his [[pseudonym]]. 
From information gleaned from his poems, historians believe that his father, a Shaivaite Brahmin, met his mother, a Kumbara woman named Mali in present-day Haveri district (formerly part of Dharwad district) of Karnataka state on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]] while on a pilgrimage. Sarvajna upheld the wisdom of pastoral life in rural areas in his poems and tried to persuade villagers to give up superstition, meaningless customs and traditions.

==[[Tripadi|Tripadis]]==
Sarvagna grew up as a wandering monk creating ''Tripadis'', the famous three liners. In all, about 2000 three-liners are attributed to him. Popular because of their [[alliteration|alliterative]] structure and simplicity, they deal mainly with social, [[ethics|ethical]] and religious issues. A number of [[riddle]]s are also attributed to Sarvajna. All his Tripadis mostly rhyme at second letter of every line.

The foundation was founded by former [[hedge fund]] manager [[Michael Steinhardt]] in 1994, who disbanded his financial practice to focus on [[philanthropy]]. Since then, the JLN has disbursed over $100 million&lt;ref&gt;

In 1999, JLN initiated one of its signature programs, [[birthright Israel | Taglit-Birthright Israel]], to provide young Jews, age 18 to 26 years old, the opportunity to tour Israel for the first time.

The current acting president of the foundation is Robert P. Aronson, who succeeded the founding president Rabbi [[Irving Greenberg|Irving "Yitz" Greenberg]] in the fall of 2007.

Since 1998, the foundation has published "[http://www.jewishlife.org/journal.html Contact]" a quarterly journal aiming "to stimulate discussion throughout the community on the most effective programs and ideas that will help to revitalize American Jewish life."

"'''The Fight Song'''" is a song by American [[rock music|rock band]] [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], released in 2001.

The title is a pun on high school and college football team anthems known as [[fight song]]s as the song is partly a post-[[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]] statement disparaging mainstream America's own glorification of violence among its youth; football is simultaneously one of the most violent sports and one of America's greatest obsessions.&lt;ref name="NME Manson Comes Out Fighting"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{Listen|pos=left|filename=Marilyn Manson - The Fight Song.ogg|title="The Fight Song"|description=A 17-second sample of "The Fight Song", an [[alternative metal]] and [[glam rock]] song.|format =[[Ogg]]}}
"The Fight Song" is an [[alternative metal]] and [[glam rock]] song with a length of two minutes and fifty-three seconds. It was written by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|eponymous vocalist]] and [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]] and produced by Manson and [[Dave Sardy]]. The track features elements of [[punk rock]] and [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/holy-wood-in-the-shadow-of-the-valley-of-death-20001123 |title=Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) |last=Walters |first=Barry |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Wenner Media]] |date=2000-11-23 |accessdate=2010-11-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915171135/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/holy-wood-in-the-shadow-of-the-valley-of-death-20001123 |archivedate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Fight Song", Manson sings "I'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist"; Steven Wells of ''[[NME]]'' said that in the song, Manson avoided the [[cliché]]s used by other [[Antitheism|antitheist]] artists.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; Both Wells of ''NME'' and Joseph  Schafer of ''[[Stereogum]]'' found the track's instrumentation similar to the guitar riff from [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s "[[Song 2]]" (1997).&lt;ref name=nme&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/track/reviews-nme-3904| last=Wells| first=Steven| title=The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs| publisher=''[[NME]]''| date=September 12, 2005| accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stereogum&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stereogum.com/1792094/the-10-best-marilyn-manson-songs/franchises/10-best-songs/| last=Schafer| first=Joseph| title=The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs| publisher=''[[Stereogum]]''| date=April 5, 2015| accessdate=December 17, 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709164025/http://www.stereogum.com/1792094/the-10-best-marilyn-manson-songs/franchises/10-best-songs/| archivedate=July 9, 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells also felt that "The Fight Song" resembles the music of [[The Sweet]], particularly "[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]" (1972).&lt;ref name=nme/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Schafer of ''Stereogum'' ranked it tenth on his list of "The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs", commenting: "In retrospect [''Holy Wood''] comes off as Manson's attempt at a ''[[Back in Black]]'', a must-have disc of all singles, but unfortunately most of its tunes are too similar to one another (and too underwhelming compared to their predecessors). 'The Fight Song' is the shiniest apple from that tree, due in large part to the Blur-esque verse riff, which gives things an open, jangly feel unique in his discography, one that serves as a potent counterpoint to the Mack Truck chorus."&lt;ref name=stereogum/&gt; ''NME''{{'s}} Wells wrote that the song "is glam pop so cheesy that it makes [[Daphne and Celeste|Daphne &amp; Celeste]] sound like [[Radiohead]]. And how cool is that? Fucking cool, actually....OK, gloves off, stomach in, dick out this freaking RAWKS!".&lt;ref name=nme/&gt;

Though she disliked ''Holy Wood'' as a whole, Liisa Ladouceur of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' said that two of its songs, "The Love Song" and "The Fight Song", are among the band's best and serve as "potent anti-authority anthems".&lt;ref name=exclaim&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/an_essential_guide_to_marilyn_manson|last=Ladouceur|first=Liisa|title=An Essential Guide to Marilyn Manson|publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]''|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=December 17, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911053048/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/an_essential_guide_to_marilyn_manson|archivedate=September 11, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alec Chillingworth of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' described "The Fight Song" as one of the band's "certified classics, branded onto [[industrial metal]]'s beating heart by one Mr Brian Warner".&lt;ref name=hammer&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-09-06/the-10-most-underrated-marilyn-manson-songs|first=Alec|last=Chillingworth|title=The 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs|date=September 6, 2016|accessdate=December 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907143326/http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-09-06/the-10-most-underrated-marilyn-manson-songs|archivedate=September 7, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for this song, directed by [[W.I.Z.]] at an abandoned [[Los Angeles]] football field, depicts the band members performing the song at a violent game of [[high school football]] between two fictional teams, "Holy Wood" (composed of [[Jock (athlete)|jock]]s in white football attire) and "Death Valley" (composed of [[Goth subculture|goths]] and social outcasts in black football attire).&lt;ref name="VH1 Goths Battle Jocks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=vanHorn |first=Teri |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1437843/20010110/marilyn_manson.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Denies Video Has Columbine Link |publisher=MTVNews.com |date=2001-01-10 |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video also features a few subliminal messages; at approximately 2:12, the video briefly replaces the scuffling football players with people fighting with police riot squads, and a Death Valley cheerleader is briefly seen throughout the video repeatedly hacking at a wooden pillar with an axe. Near the end of the video, it begins to rain, and a Death Valley player throws the football at the scoreboard, making it and the goalpost burst into flames. The video ends with the flaming goalpost collapsing forward.
==Controversy==
The music video generated minor controversy for its violent depiction of an [[American football]] game between [[Jock (athlete)|jock]]s and [[Goth subculture|goths]], which some sources have interpreted to be directly "echoing" ''Columbine''.&lt;ref name="NME See Stills From New Manson Video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/marilyn-manson/6423 |title=See Stills From New Manson Video |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=2001-02-13 |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100953/http://www.nme.com/news/marilyn-manson/6423 |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NME Manson Comes Out Fighting"/&gt; Manson has vehemently denied this.&lt;ref name="NME See Stills From New Manson Video"/&gt; He further dismissed the claims to [[MTV News]] at the ''[[American Music Award]]s'' on January 8, 2001, stating, "People will put into it what they want if it helps them sell newspapers or helps them write a headline. They're gonna want to turn it into something it isn't. [[Criticism|Flak]] is my job."&lt;ref name="NME Manson Comes Out Fighting"/&gt;

'''Natalie "The Floacist" Stewart''' (born 13 February 1979) is an English singer-songwriter,  rapper, poet,  and actress. Born and raised in London,{{Contradict inline|section=Early life}} she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the early 2000s as part of R&amp;B girl-duo [[Floetry]].  Their hiatus saw the release of Stewart’s debut album, ''Floetic Soul'' (2010), which established her as a solo artist worldwide; which featured the singles "Forever" and "Let Me".

Following her establishment of her solo career, she released her second solo album, ''Floetry Re:Birth'' (2012), which contained singles "Say Yes", "Soul", and "Speechless". In 2014, Stewart released her third solo album ''Rise of the Phoenix Mermaid''.

A self-described "modern-day poet", The Floacist creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and inspiration, as well as problems and solutions. Throughout a career spanning 16 years, she has sold over 2 million records.

==Early life==
The Floacist is the daughter of Jamaican immigrants. With her father in the British Armed Forces, she was born into a travelling family.

After her father left the army, the family settled in London.&lt;ref name = philly/&gt; She attended the [[BRIT School]] for Performing Arts and Technology, where [[Marsha Ambrosius]] was studying Business and Finance. The Floacist studied Performing Arts, Media and Art. She attended [[Middlesex University]], and later transferred to the [[University of North London]]. She was a founding member of the performance poetry group 3 Plus 1, which was critically well received in London, Birmingham, and Manchester. The Floacist found her true calling on the performance poetry scene, where she was able to natural merge all of her artistic expressional outputs as a writer and performer. This led to the manifestation of her Floetic ethos of 'poetic delivery of musical intent'.

==Career==
===1999–2006: Floetry===
{{main|Floetry}}
[[Floetry]] was formed after Ambrosius joined her on stage in 1999 to perform at a spoken word night called Poets vs MC's, where they debuted a piece that they had written together called "Fantasize", combining spoken word and singing. In 2000, the duo traveled to the United States to perform on the poetry circuit. After frequenting spoken word/poetry spots in Atlanta, such as Yin Yang Poets' Cafe, they moved on to [[Philadelphia]]. There they met Darren "Limitless" Henson and Keith "Keshon" Pelzer of [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]'s Touch of Jazz studio and began recording.

In 2002, they signed with [[DreamWorks Records]] and released their debut album ''[[Floetic]]'', which featured the singles "Floetic", "[[Say Yes (Floetry song)|Say Yes]]" and "[[Getting Late]]". The album was also released in the UK with additional tracks, one of which featured the British singer-songwriter and record producer, Sebastian Rogers.

==Personal life==
The Floacist is known to speak of the ultimate focus of her life being the continual development, evolution and growth of her person; spiritually, mentally and artistically.&lt;ref name="vibe"/&gt; When asked about her spiritual practices she simply responds that her spiritual practice is memory; remembering the peace before the confusion!&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takiff|first1=Jonathan|title=2 artists, 2 journeys toward bliss|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-07-18/news/51714712_1_michael-franti-floacist-floetry|website=philly.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RBvR9uJr?url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-07-18/news/51714712_1_michael-franti-floacist-floetry|archivedate=19 July 2014|date=18 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Unitarian Universalism]]''' and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) have a long-standing tradition of welcoming '''[[LGBT]]''' people.

==History==
The first ordained minister of a major religious group in the U.S. or Canada to [[come out of the closet|come out]] as gay was UU Minister [[James Stoll]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050217204501/http://www.uupetaluma.org/sermons/sermon09jan05.html "My Greatly Human Hometown Minister--James Lewis Stoll, 1936-1994"]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several UUA resolutions supporting people regardless of sexual orientation since 1970. Unitarian Universalism was the first denomination to accept openly [[transgender]] people as full members with eligibility to become clergy; in 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association.&lt;ref name="uua.org"&gt;http://www.uua.org/lgbtq/history/185789.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.uua.org/aboutus/professionalstaff/identity-basedministries/bisexualgay/25237.shtml Office of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Concerns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813112933/http://www.uua.org/aboutus/professionalstaff/identity-basedministries/bisexualgay/25237.shtml |date=2010-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_uua.htm|title=The Unitarian Universalist Association and Homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UUA has had a popular program for a church wanting to become a "Welcoming Congregation" for LGBT people since 1989. UUA has officially supported UUA clergy performing Services of Union between same-sex couples since 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 "Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages"], UPI, ''New York Times'', 29 June 1984, retrieved on 21 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/obgltc/resource/history.html UUA: Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Community]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Sean Dennison became the first openly transgender person in the Unitarian Universalist ministry called to serve a congregation; he was called to South Valley UU Society, Salt Lake City, UT.&lt;ref name="uua.org"/&gt; In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2007/06/11/religious-leaders-must-support-justice-for-all Religious Leaders Must Support Justice for All | Reproductive Health | RHRealityCheck.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instituted organizations==
The UUA maintains an office called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Ministries (LGBTQ Ministries)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/directory/staff/multiculturalgrowth/lesbiangay/ Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt; (which operates the Welcoming Congregation program). Established in 1973 as the "Office of Gay Affairs", it was the first major national religious organization to open a dedicated office for LGBT inclusion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"/&gt; There is also a fellowship of [[LGBT]] Unitarian Universalists and supporters called Interweave Continental. Interweave is a related organization of the UUA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interweavecontinental.ning.com/about Interweave Continental] About&lt;/ref&gt; Any UU church desiring to become a Welcoming Congregation must meet the requirements set out in ''The Welcoming Congregation Handbook'' by LGBTQ Ministries. Once the requirements have been met, the UUA designates that church as a Welcoming Congregation and adds an icon to the listing in the UUA Directory. Usually, the Welcoming Committee evolves into an Interweave Chapter. Each chapter requests financial and advocacy support from the fellowship with which it is connected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interweaveuu.org/ Interweave Continental]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC) similarly operates a [[Gender and Sexual Diversity]] Monitoring Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/social_responsibility_monitoring_groups/gender-and-sexual-diversity/ Gender and Sexual Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; and like the UUA (of which it became autonomous in 2002), has Welcoming Congregations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/wp-content/uploads//2011/10/cucbrochures_welcomingcongregation.pdf CUC pamphlet on their Welcoming Congregation program]&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Unitarian Universalist congregations perform same-sex marriages and the CUC supports this work through its Lay Chaplaincy program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/wp-content/uploads//2011/10/cucbrochures_laychaplaincy.pdf CUC pamphlet on their Lay Chaplaincy program]&lt;/ref&gt; The first same-sex marriage performed by a church in Canada&lt;ref&gt;[https://humanrights.ca/blog/long-love-shall-last]&lt;/ref&gt; (after 1972 a civil same-sex marriage for [[Michel Girouard]] and Rejean Tremblay of Montreal&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.radio-canada.ca/emissions/580-3437/page/1/]&lt;/ref&gt;) was that of Chris Vogel and Richard North, married by the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Winnipeg on February 11, 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/rights-freedoms/gay-and-lesbian-emergence-out-in-canada/winnipeg-couple-marries.html]&lt;/ref&gt; officiated by Unitarian Minister Rev. Norm Naylor. The Unitarian Universalist Church was responsible for the first same-sex marriages performed in Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan, mostly in the 1970s, although the provincial governments often refused to recognize the marriages at the time.

==Welcoming Congregation==
A Welcoming Congregation&lt;ref name=WC&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/obgltc/wcp/wc1expln.html Welcoming Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Local church|church]] in the Unitarian Universalist Association or Canadian Unitarian Council that has undergone an intensive educational program to help the congregation become more inclusive of [[lesbian]]s, [[gay]]s, [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people. Many [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Unitarian Universalist]] churches have adopted this.

The '''Urdhva Pundra''' is a [[tilak]] worn by followers of the Hindu sect [[Vaishnavism]] to show that they are devotees of [[Vishnu]]. It is generally worn on the forehead, but also on other parts of the body. The markings are made either as a daily ritual, or on special occasions, and denote which particular lineage, or ''[[sampradaya]]'' the devotee belongs to. The different Vaishnava sampradayas each have their own distinctive style of tilak based on the [[siddhanta]] of their particular lineage. The general tilak pattern is of two or more vertical lines resembling the letter U, which commonly represents the foot of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-621641/Vaishnavism britannica.com - Vaishnavism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different forms==

===Vallabha sampradaya===
[[Image:Rudra Sampradaya Tilak.PNG|x90px|right|Tilak]]
In the [[Vallabha]], Rudra sampradaya the [[tilak]] worn is  a double vertical red line which is rounded from base. This "U" represents Purna Purushottama Shri Krishna's lotus feet who is the only form of god worshipped in the Vallabha sampradaya.

===Madhva sampradaya===
[[Image:AngaraAkshate1.svg|x100px|right|Angara-Akshate]]The [[Madhwas|Madhva]] sampradaya mark two vertical lines with Gopichandana representing Krishna's 'lotus feet'.&lt;ref name="veda.harekrsna.cz"&gt;[http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/general.htm#17 Vedic Encyclopedia - see Tilak section]&lt;/ref&gt; In between a vertical black line is made from the daily coal of the dhupa (incense). In this sampradaya,worship is done to Narayana or Krishna daily. The coal left after offering incense is used to mark the black line. This is called as angara. Those who are wearing this line have finished the Devara Puja (worship). Underneath the black line,  red dot is added to indicate that one has finished eating their lunch.This dot is called as akshate. It is the ash of the banana tree flower petal mixed with turmeric paste. The shape of angara-akshate is like that of a gada (mace). It is supposed to be Pranadeva Sannidhi (have the presence of Vayu Devaru).  Those who did not perform daily worship to Narayana wear the simple two line tilak only.

===Sri Vaishnavism===
[[Image:Brosen sritilaka.svg|x100px|right|Sri-tilaka]]The mark here is called [[Srichurnam]]. Members of the [[Sri Vaishnava]] tradition form tilak with two lines representing the feet of [[Narayana]],&lt;ref name="veda.harekrsna.cz"/&gt; with a red line in the middle which representing [[Lakshmi]]devi. A small line on the top bridge of the nose which represents that the wearer belongs to the [[Thenkalai]] subsect. Because the [[Sri]] Vaishnava sampradaya begins with Lakshmi, and because they approach Narayana through Lakshmi, their tilak reflects this process of surrender, known as ''[[Saranagati]]'' (or sometimes also ''Prapatti''). Within Sri Vaishnavism, this process of surrender (sarangati) to Vishnu. A variant to this is found within the [[Ramanandi sect]], begun by [[Ramananda]], who wear a similar tilak design but in reference to [[Sita]] and [[Rama]] (whom their devotion is focused upon) rather than Lakshmi and Narayana.

[[File:Thengalai thiruman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Thenkalai]] Sect]]
[[File:Vadagalai Tiruman.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Vadakalai]] Sect]]

====Thenkalai====
In South India's Iyengar Tradition there are 2 forms of Tilak. One is [[Thenkalai]] (Southern Sect) and other is Vadakalai. (Northern Sect).

[[Thenkalai]] are a subsect of the [[Vaishnavite]] [[Iyengar]] community of [[Hindu]] [[Brahmins]]. Thenkalais are followers of [[Ramanuja]], [[Pillai Lokacharya]] and [[Manavala Mamuni]].

====Vadakalai====
[[Vadakalai]], meaning Northern school or Northern culture, are a subsect of the [[Vaishnavite]] [[Iyengar]] community of [[Hindu]] [[Brahmins]]. In Sanskrit the Vadakalai are referred to as '''Uttara Kalārya'''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DPP7O3nb3g0C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=uttara+kalarya#v=onepage&amp;q=uttara%20kalarya&amp;f=false |title=Pg 205 Students' Britannica India |publisher=Books.google.co.in |accessdate=20 November 2011|isbn=9780852297605 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vadakalais are followers of [[Ramanuja]] and [[Vedanta Desika]].&lt;ref name="tamilakamp166"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Tamilakam.

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
In the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] sampradaya the tilak is usually made out of mud from [[Vrindavan]]. The main tilak is basically identical to the [[Madhwas|Madhva]] tilak. Below the two lines, on the bridge of the nose is the shape of a [[tulsi]] leaf, while other vaishnav groups may instead feature the shape of the [[neem]] or [[Saraca indica|asoka]] leaf. The slight difference arose due to the emphasis on direct devotional service such as hearing from the shastras and glorifying the Lord in accordance with Srimad-Bhagavatam. As such, the black line made from the ash of the fire sacrifice is not included. As per Sri Hari Bhakti Vilasa (4.211), the tilaka is a U that begins from the beginning of the nose which is technically 1/3rd the distance from the base to the tip. In due course of time, this original tilaka was modified to suit various divisions and sects.

===Nimbarka sampradaya===
[[Image:Shankhchakra.jpg|thumb|x100px|The Nibarka tilak between the Shankh and Chakra]]In [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], the tilak is made of [[Gopi]]-Chandana (the clay from Gopi Kunda lake in [[Dwarka]], [[Gujarat]]), as described in the Vasudeva [[Upanishad]]. It starts at the bridge of the nose and continues as two vertical lines to the top of the forehead. This is said to represent the temple of God. Within these lines, between the eyebrows is a black dot, made from the slate found in [[Barsana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], the sacred birthplace of [[Radha]]. This is said to represent God as Radha and Krishna together. This tilak personifies the tenets of the Sampradaya, that God is Radha and Krishna together, none else. It is supposed to have been first given to Nimbarka at the time of his initiation by the sage, [[Narada]]. The tilak is first given to an initiate by their [[guru]] at the time of [[initiation]], and after this, daily the devotee will remember his guru before he adorns the tilaka on his head.{{clear}}

===Swaminarayan Sampradaya===
[[Image:Swaminarayan U.svg|50px|right|Udharva Marka, illustrated]]
The tilak is made of sandalwood paste. This has a cool, soothing effect and the fragrance helps to maintain a pure and clear mind. The chandlo is made of red kum kum (potash nitrate). The tilak represents the Lord and the chandlo represents the muktas that reside within Him. Once the Muktas enter the murti, they will eternally remain there. There is a union between them, i.e. they appear as one, but there is a distinction, the master and the devotee. When the two merge, they appear as one, but in reality they remain distinct in their nature and their attributes, with God remaining the master and the soul forever remaining the servant.

{{other people|Victor Sanchez}}

'''Víctor Sánchez''' (born December 9, 1961) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] author. He was initially inspired by the writings of [[Carlos Castaneda]] and by his own studies among the [[Wirrarika]], said to be cultural descendants of the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Toltec]]s.

Sanchez's first book, ''The Teachings of Don Carlos: Practical Applications of the Works of Carlos Castaneda'' (1995), provides in-depth techniques and commentary on a path of "self-growth" based on the wisdom of the Toltec descendants. His approach in this book is bringing the proposals of Castaneda down to the earth focusing on those parts of Castaneda's book that can be applied in everyday life and used for personal development, while discouraging the use of psychotropic plants, which was prominent in mostly in the first book of Castaneda "The Teachings of Don Juan" . Sanchez has published four further books: ''Toltecs of the New Millennium'' (1996), providing an overview of and background on the author's experiences with the Wirrarika; ''The Toltec Path of Recapitulation: Healing Your Past to Free Your Soul'' (2001); and ''The Toltec Oracle'' (2004); and "Los Colores de Tu Alma" (The Colors of Your Soul - not yet translated into English) (2014). Sanchez's recapitulation technique bears some resemblance to [[Sandra Ingerman]]'s [[soul retrieval]] technique, but is probably the most comprehensive approach to the subject that has been published so far. Other shamanic teachers using similar techniques include [[Michael Harner, PhD]] founder of [[core shamanism]], and Ken Page, founder of [[Heart and Soul Healing]]. Some have associated Sanchez's work with Toltec author Don [[Miguel Ángel Ruiz]], author of the [[Four Agreements]]. Sánchez usually respond to such association, that while he likes the general message of Ruiz´ book, they are not particular of the Toltec but could be found in many religions or world philosophies.

Even though Sanchez´ work prominently deals with the topic of shamanism, he does not accept to be described as a shaman, but rather as a researcher in the field of indigenous knowledge, shamanism and personal development. He states that "shamanism is way too important to leave it in the hands of shamans". His approach is that the core shamanic experience is about a shift in human consciousness that is meant to be performed by any human being and the emphasis in shamans with special powers to be admired or followed can be a distraction of the real task of "re-integrating the other side of our consciousness". For him the cult to celebrities or gurus diverts people´s attention away from the key elements of real personal development which depends of each individual´s action.

Due to Sanchez´emphasis on the importance of actual research, study and real life experiences; he feels skeptical about the fact that much of what is said and written about the Toltec in spiritual oriented books, come more from literary imagination, rather than actual research with the living Toltec descendants indigenous communities of Mexico or from the study of the ancient Mexican codices.

In his works Sanchez coins the term "anti-anthropology", likening his form of research to [[anti-psychiatry]]. His approach to the study of the natives he portrays is, in his own words, "not to transform them, but to transform" himself by looking at the indigenous ways of soul development, in contrast to the anthropology academic approach which focuses more on the material elements of the culture, political organization, economy, etc., while leaving aside fundamental matters such as the perspective and experience of indigenous cultures regarding the development of human soul or psyche.  

Sanchez was sued by Castaneda for infringement of copyright after including an eagle, desert, and other iconography on the covers of his books similar to that used by Castaneda. It is worth to notice that the law suit was not related to the contents of the book but to the initial design of the cover, which was not authored by Sanchez but by his publisher, Bear and Company, Inc. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6uF00yUt3dYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Beauty+of+the+Primitive] The Beauty of the Primitive, page 396&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time''''' is a 1997 book by science writer [[Michael Shermer]]. The foreword was written by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

==Content==
In the first section, Shermer discusses the ideas that he has towards [[skepticism]]. He also explains his conversion to [[Deism]] from [[New Age]] [[mysticism]] (to which he had converted from being a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist Christian]] [[Baptist]]).

In part two Shermer explains [[paranormal]] thinking and how one comes to believe in things without evidence. He uses [[Edgar Cayce]] as an example, and while he agrees with parts of [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], he criticizes its [[moral absolutism]] and argues that many follow her philosophy unquestioningly, which he believes contradicts [[freethought|free thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shermer |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Shermer |title= The Unlikeliest Cult in History |journal= [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |year= 1993 |pages= 74–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part three begins with Shermer describing several debates he had with [[Duane Gish]]. He lays out some [[creationism|creationist]] arguments in 25 separate claims, and attempts to debunk each one with his own evidence. He closes retelling how a constitutional ban on teaching creationism in public schools was [[Edwards v. Aguillard|narrowly upheld]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1987.

Shermer shows that the [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] reject proven facts for, as he states, [[ideology|ideological]] reasons. Like the creationists, he asserted, many Holocaust deniers believe that the evidence sides with them. He describes meeting and arguing with the deniers and lays out their arguments then shows evidence to support his own statements.

In part five Shermer relates [[Frank J. Tipler]] to [[Voltaire]]'s character [[Candide|Pangloss]] to show how smart people deceive themselves. Shermer explores the psychology of scholars and business men who give up their careers in their pursuit to broadcast their paranormal beliefs. In his last chapter, added to the revised version, Shermer explains why he believes that "intelligent people" can be more susceptible to believing in weird things than others.

==Reviews==
According to ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine, "Shermer's episodic book covers a wide range of subjects, in a wide range of manners. He takes ritual jabs at such old debunker punching bags as [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] and [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s (through UFOlogy's newest twist, [[alien abduction]] of humans). You'll also find cogent debunkings of strange phenomena such as [[fire walking]] and [[psychic]]s who can discover "unknowable" facts about strangers. The longest sections of the book take on the more-substantive issues of creationism and Holocaust denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/30407.html | title=Why People Believe Weird Things Review | publisher=[[Reason magazine]] |date= November 1997 | first= | last=    | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given 4 out of 5 stars by popularscience.co.uk, which said "In this classic, originally published in 1997 but reviewed in a new UK edition, he gives a powerful argument for taking the sceptical viewpoint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev358.htm | title=Why People Believe Weird Things Review | publisher=popularscience.co.uk |year= 2008 | first= | last=    | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "Shermer's directly written book is the perfect handbook to thrust on anyone you know who has been lured into conforming paranoias that circulate amid the [[Premillennialism|premillennial]] jitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Why People Believe Weird Things Review | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= June 15, 1997 | first= | last=    }}{{vs|is this the review? http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-15/books/bk-3415_1_exceptional-reading|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Independent Thinking Review'' wrote, "This is a book that deserves to be widely read. Skeptics and [[critical thinking|critical thinkers]] can learn from it, but more importantly, it's a book to give those who maybe aren't as skeptical as you, those who need some clear and reasonable arguments to gently push them in a more critical direction. Read this book yourself: buy it for someone whose mind you care about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Why People Believe Weird Things Review | publisher=[[Independent Thinking Review]] |date= October 1997 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xuetes''' ({{IPA-ca|ʃuˈətə}}; singular ''Xueta'', also known as ''Xuetons'' and spelled as Chuetas) are a social group on the island of [[Majorca]] in the Mediterranean Sea near Spain, the descendants of Majorcan Jews who either were [[converso]]s (forcible [[converts to Christianity]]) or were [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]], forced to keep their religion hidden. They practiced strict [[endogamy]] by marrying only within their own group. Many of their descendants observe a [[Syncretism|syncretist]] form of Christian worship known as [[Xueta Christianity]].

The Xuetes were stigmatized up until the first half of the 20th century. In the latter part of the century, the spread of [[freedom of religion]] and [[laïcité]] reduced both the social pressure and community ties. An estimated 18,000 people in the island carry Xueta surnames in the 21st century, but only a small fraction of the society (including those with Xueta surnames) is aware of the complex history of this group.

== Etymology of Xueta ==
The [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]] word ''xueta'' derives, according to some experts, from ''juetó'', diminutive of ''jueu'' ("Jew") which give ''xuetó'', a term that also still survives. Other authors consider that it may derive from the word ''xulla'' {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} (pronounced ''xuia'' or ''xua,'' which means a type of salted bacon and, by extension, [[pork]]) and, according to popular belief, refers to Xuetes who were seen eating pork to show that they did not practice Judaism. But this etymology has also been linked with the tendency, present in various cultures, of using offensive names related to pork to designate Jews and Jewish converts (see, for example ''[[Marrano]]''). A third possibility links both putative etymologies; the word ''xuia'' may have provoked the substitution of the ''j'' of ''juetó'' by the ''x'' of ''xuetó'', and ''xueta'' could have been imposed over ''xuetó'' by the greater phonetic resemblance with ''xuia''. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The Xueta have also been called ''"del Segell"'' ("of Segell"), after a street on which many lived, or ''del carrer'' ("of the street") as a shortened form of ''"del carrer del Segell"''; possibly also by way of [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]] ''"de la calle"'', provoked from an approximate phonetic translation of ''"del call"'' ("of the Jewish quarter", "of the ghetto"; Catalan/Balear ''call'' means "street", often used as a designation for a ghetto, cf. Yiddish ''gass''), perhaps made by functionaries of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] origin, in reference to the old Jewish quarter of the city of [[Palma, Majorca]]. In modern times, it relates to the ''carrer de l'Argenteria'' or ''the street of the silversmiths'', after a Xueta street that defines the neighborhood around the church of Santa Eulàlia. This neighbourhood is where the majority of the Xueta lived, and takes its name from a popular occupation of that group. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In some older official documents, the expressions ''"de gènere hebreorum"'' ("of Hebrew genus") or ''"d'estirp hebrea"'' ("of Hebrew lineage") are used {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. The Xueta have been referred to simply as ''jueus'' ("Jews") or, more frequently, by the Castilianism “judios”.

The Xuetes, aware of the original offensive meaning of the term ''xuete'', have preferred to identify as ''"del Segell"'', ''"del carrer"'' or, most commonly, with ''"noltros"'' or ''"es nostros"'' ("us"), opposed to ''"ets altres"'' ("the others") or ''"es de fora del carrer"'' ("those from outside the street").

== Xueta surnames ==
The Xueta [[surnames]] are: Aguiló, Bonnin, Cortès, Fortesa, Fuster, Martí, Miró, Picó, Pinya/Piña, Pomar, Segura, Tarongí, Valentí, Valleriola and Valls; Picó and Segura are not found among those condemned by the Inquisition, nor is Valentí, which was originally the nickname of a family who were then known as Fortesa. Notice that many of those surnames are also very common in the general population of Catalan-speaking territories.

Surnames Galiana, Moyà and Sureda figure among the penitents without having been considered Xuetes.

Numerous surnames in Majorca with clear Jewish origin are present on the island yet are not considered to belong to the Xueta community. Examples are Abraham, Amar, Bofill, Bonet, Daviu, Duran, Homar, Jordà, Maimó, Salom, Vidal among others. These may derive from a broader ''converso'' community yet were never stigmatized as such. [[Inquisition]] registers from the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century document more than 330 surnames among those persons condemned in Majorca.

Therefore, Converso origin is not sufficient to be considered Xueta. Although Xuetas are descendants of Conversos only a fraction of Converso descendants are considered Xuetas.&lt;ref&gt;En este sentido se documentan descendientes ''secretos'' de conversos mallorquines (de transmisión exclusivamente familiar) orgullosos de su origen pero hostiles hacia los chuetas, Moore, ''Los de la calle…'' pp. 187 y 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xueta genetics==
A variety of genetic studies conducted, principally, by the Departament of Human Genetics of the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] have indicated that the Xuetes constitute a genetically homogeneous group with the populations of [[Mizrahi Jews]] and are also related to [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and those of [[North Africa]], based on analyzing both the [[Y chromosome]], which traces patrilineal descent, and the [[mitochondrial DNA]], which traces matrilineal descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ca icon}} Misericòrdia Ramon Juanpere, et al., [http://www.uib.es/servei/comunicacio/sc/projectes/arxiu/nousprojectes/gen/gen.pdf Tres poblacions genèticament diferenciades a les Illes Balears] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925161612/http://www.uib.es/servei/comunicacio/sc/projectes/arxiu/nousprojectes/gen/gen.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }}, Universitat de les Illes Balears, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic antecedents ==

=== The ''conversos'' (1391-1488) ===
[[File:Francesco del Cossa 019.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vincent Ferrer|Saint Vicent Ferrer]], predicative assets for the conversion of the Jews.]]
The assault on the ''calls'' — the Majorcan Jewish ghettoes — in 1391, the preaching of [[Vincent Ferrer]] in 1413, and the conversion of the remainder of the Jewish community of Majorca, in 1435, constituted the three events that resulted in numerous ''conversos.'' They had agreed to mass conversions in order to manage a collective peril rather than individual spiritual changes.

Many of the new Christians continued their traditional communal and religious practices. They established the ''"Confraria de Sant Miquel"'' or ''"dels Conversos"'' ("The Confraternity of Saint Michael" or "of the Converts"). It largely replaced former ''[[Aljama]]'' in taking care of the group's social needs, for instance, assistance to the needy, an internal organ of justice, officiating at weddings, and supporting religious cohesion. At the end of the last quarter of the 15th century, the conversos carried on their activities, some of them clandestine, without suffering external pressures. The guilds did not discriminate based on Jewish origin. The conversos managed some social cohesion.

=== The beginnings of the Spanish Inquisition, (1488-1544) ===
{{main|Spanish Inquisition}}

[[File:Escut inquisició.jpg|thumb|Shield of the Inquisition used in Mallorca.]]
In 1488, while some of the last converts of 1435 were still alive, the first Inquisitors of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] — a tribunal newly created by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] as part of an effort to forge a [[nation state]] on the base of religious uniformity — arrived in Majorca. The introduction of such a tribunal was followed by public complaints and general opposition in Majorca, as throughout the rest of the [[Crown of Aragon]], but it was useless. Their central objective was the repression of Crypto-Judaism, which they began by applying the [[Edicts of Grace]], which allow severe punishment for [[heresy]] to be avoided through [[self-incrimination]].

By the Edicts of Grace (1488–1492), 559 Majorcans confessed to Jewish practices and the Inquisition obtained the names of the majority of the Judaizing Majorcans, against whom, together with their families and their closest associates, they exercised a harsh punitive activity. Subsequently, until 1544, 239 Crypto-Jews were reconciled and 537 were "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]]" — that is, turned over to the civil authorities to be executed — 82 of whom were effectively executed and burned. The majority of the remaining 455, who managed to flee, were burnt in effigy. This exile was distinct from the decree of expulsion of 1492, which did not apply to Majorca, which officially had no Jews left in it by 1435.

=== The new clandestinity (1545-1673) ===
After this period, the Majorcan Inquisition ceased to act against the judaizers, even though there were signs of prohibited practices; the causes may have been: the participation of the inquisitorial structure in conflicts between local armed factions (''bandositats''); the appearance of new religious phenomena such as some conversions to Islam and Protestantism or the control of the morality of the clergy. But, beyond a doubt, also the adoption of more efficacious strategies of protection on the part of the Crypto-Jews: the later inquisitorial trials talk about how religious practices were transferred within families when a child reached the age of adolescence and, very often in the case of the women, when it became clear whom she would marry and what were the husband's religious convictions.

In any event, this period was characterized by the reduction of the group by means of the flight of the penitents of the earlier epoch, the unconditional adhesion to Catholicism of the majority of those who remained, and the generalization of the statutes of ''neteja de sang'' (literally "purity of blood", most commonly referred to in English by the Spanish language expression ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'') in the majority of the guild organizations and religious orders. But despite all of this, a small group persevered in their clandestine practices, essentially those who would later be known as the Xuetes, those who, furthermore, maintained and adopted social, familial, and economic strategies of internal cohesion.

[[File:Livorno_Sinagoga_XIX_century.JPG|thumb|Sinagoga de [[Livorno]] (built in the 17th century), city of reference for the majorcan criptojews.]]
From 1640, the descendants of the converts began a marked process of economic ascent and increasing commercial influence. Previously, and with some exceptions, they had been artisans, shopkeepers, and retail distributors, but starting from this time, and for reasons not well explained, some began to focus strongly on economic activity: they created complex mercantile companies, participated in foreign trade, coming to control, at the time of the end of the inquisitorial trials, 36% of the total, they dominated the market for insurance and retail commerce of imported products. Otherwise, companies were usually owned by ''conversos'', and they gave part of their profits to works of charity in benefit of the "community", unlike the rest of the population, that used to give its profits as charity donations to the Church.

Because of the intense exterior economic activity, the Xuetes resumed their contact with the international communities of Jews, especially of [[Livorno]], of [[Rome]], of [[Marseille]], and of [[Amsterdam]], through whom the converts had access to Jewish literature. It is known that Rafel Valls, known as ''"el Rabí"'' ("the Rabbi") religious leader of the Majorcan converts, traveled to [[Alexandria]] and [[Smyrna]] in the era of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], but it is unknown whether he had any contact with him.

An internal system of social stratification probably began in that period, although it is also believed to be a remnant of the Jewish (pre-conversion) period. This system distinguished a kind of aristocracy, called ''"orella alta"'' (literally "high ears"), from the rest of the group, ''"orella baixa"'' ("low ears"). Along with other distinctions based on religion, professions, and parentage this configured a tapestry of alliances and avoidances among surnames, which had a great influence on endogamistic practices of the period.

== Origins of the Xuetes ==

=== The second persecution (1673-1695) ===
The reasons why the Inquisition returned to act against the judaizing Majorcans after some 130 years of inactivity, and in an era in which the inquisition was already in decline are not very clear: the preoccupation of decadent economic sectors before the ascent and commercial dynamism of the converts, the resumption of religious practices in community, rather than limited to a domestic context, a new growth of religious zeal, and the judgment against Alonso López could have been influential factors.

==== The precedents ====
In July 1672, a merchant informed the Inquisition that some Jews of Livorno had made inquiries about the Jews of Majorca with the names "Forteses, Aguilons, Martins, Tarongins, Cortesos, Picons".

[[File:Entaulat acte de fe 1675.jpg|thumb|Map of the banquet of the act of faith of 1675 in Mallorca.]]
In 1673, a ship with a group of Jews expelled from [[Oran]] by the Spanish Crown and headed for Livorno, called in at Palma. The Inquisition arrested a youth of some 17 years who went by the name Isaac López, who had been born in Madrid and baptised with the name of Alonso, and as a small boy fled to the [[Berber people|Berber]] lands with his two ''converso'' parents. Alonso refused to repent and was finally burnt alive in 1675. His execution provoked a great commotion among the judaizers, while also being the object of great admiration for his persistence and courage.

The same year López was arrested, some servants of the ''conversos'' informed their confessor that they had spied upon their masters participating in Jewish ceremonies.

In 1674, the prosecutor of the Majorca tribunal sent a report to the Supreme Inquisition in which he accused the Majorcan Crypto-Jews of 33 charges, among them their refusal to marry ''"cristians de natura"'' ("natural Christians") and their social rejection of those who did so; the practice of secrecy; the imposition of Old Testament names for their children; the identification with their tribe of origin, and the arrangement of marriages as a function of that fact; the exclusion in their homes of the iconography of the New Testament and the presence of those of the Old; contempt for and insults toward Christians; exercising professions related to weights and measures in order to trick Christians; holding positions in the Church in order to later mock them with impunity;  applying their own legal system; taking up collections for their own poor; financing a synagogue in Rome, where they had a representative; holding clandestine meetings; complying with Jewish dietetic practices, including those of animal sacrifice and of fast days; the observance of the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]; and avoidance of [[Anointing of the Sick|Last Rites]] at the time of death.

==== Conspiracism ====
[[File:Plànol de la Inquisició de Mallorca.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the headquarters of the Inquisition of Mallorca, built in charge to the confiscation of the convicted persons in 1678.]]
Four years later, in 1677, the Supreme Inquisition ordered the Majorcan Inquisition to act on the case of the confession of the servants. According to the servants, the ''observants'', as they called themselves, in reference to the [[Torah]], met in a garden in Palma where they observed [[Yom Kippur]]. This led to the detention of some of the leaders of the Crypto-Jewish community of Majorca, Pere Onofre Cortès (also known as Moixina), master of one of the servants and proprietor of the garden, along with five other people. From that point on, they proceeded to arrest 237 individuals in the course of a single year.

Helped by corrupt functionaries, the accused were able to arrange to only provide limited information in their own confessions and to denounce as few of their co-religionists as possible. All of the accused solicited the opportunity to return to the Church, and were reconciled.

Part of the penalty consisted of the confiscation of all of the goods of the condemned, which were valued at two million Majorcan lliura which, according to the usual procedures of the inquisition, had to be paid in actual currency. This constituted an exorbitant quantity for the era and, according to a protest of the [[Gran i General Consell]], there was not this much hard cash on the entire island.

Finally, in the spring of 1679, five [[Auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]] took place, the first of which was preceded by the demolition of the building in the garden and the [[salting the earth]] where the ''conversos'' met. Before an expectant multitude, condemnation was pronounced against 221 ''conversos''. Afterward, those who were condemned to prison were transported to serve out their sentences in new prisons erected by the Inquisition, and had their goods confiscated.

==== The ''Cremadissa'' (mass burning) ====
[[File:Goya9.jpg|thumb|right|Inquisition condemned ([[Francisco de Goya]]).]]
Once the jail penalties were served, a great part of those who persisted in the Jewish faith, whose clandestine practices were noticed, harassed by inquisitorial vigilance and vexed by a society they considered responsible for the economic crisis provoked by the confiscations, decided to gradually flee the island in small groups.

In the middle of this process, an anecdoctal event precipitated a new wave of inquisitions. Rafel Cortès, (also known as ''Cap loco'' or Crazy head), had remarried, this time with a woman with a ''converso'' surname, Miró, but who was Catholic. His family did not congratulate him on getting married and censured him for having married someone not of Jewish ancestry. Hurt in his pride, he denounced some of their coreligionists before the Inquisition of maintaining the prohibited faith. Suspecting that he had made a general denunciation, they agreed upon a mass escape. On 7 March 1688, a large group of converts embarked clandestinely on an English vessel, but unexpected rough weather prevented them from leaving, and at daybreak they returned to their houses. The Inquisition was notified of this, and all of the group was arrested.

The trials lasted three years and the cohesion of the group was weakened by a strict regime of isolation, which prevented any joint action, together with a perception of religious defeat due to the impossibility of escape. In 1691, the Inquisition, in three ''autos de fe'', condemned 73 people, of whom 45 were turned over to the civil authorities to be burnt, 5 burnt in effigy; 3 already deceased had their bones burned, 37 were effectively punished; of these, three — Rafel Valls and the siblings Rafel Benet and [[Caterina Tarongí]] — were burned alive. 30,000 people attended.

The sentences dictated by the Inquisition included other penalties that were to be maintained for at least two generations: those in the household of the condemned, as well as their children and grandchildren, could not hold public offices, be ordained as priests, marry persons other than Xuetes, carry jewelry or ride a horse. These last two penalties do not appear to have been carried out, although the others continued in effect by the force of custom, beyond the two generations stipulated.

==== The final trials ====
The Inquisition opened, and eventually closed, several trials of individuals denounced by the accused of the ''autos de fe'' of 1691, the majority dead. A single ''auto de fe'' was brought in 1695 against 11 dead people and one living woman (who was reconciled). Also, in the 18th century, the Inquisition carried out two individual trials: in 1718, Rafel Pinya spontaneously inculpated himself and was reconciled, and in 1720, Gabriel Cortès, (also known as Morrofés) fled to Alexandria and returned formally to Judaism; he was burnt in effigy as the last person condemned to death by the Majorcan Inquisition. There is no doubt that these last cases are anecdotal; with the trials of 1691 came the end of the Crypto-Jewry of Majorca. The effect of the escape of the leaders, the devastation of the mass burnings, and the generalized fear made it impossible to sustain the ancestral faith. It is after these events, we can begin to actually speak of the Xuetes.

=== Anti-Xueta propaganda ===

==== ''Faith Triumphant'' ====
[[File:La Fe Triunfante 1691.jpg|thumb|left|First edition of ''La Fe Triunfante'' de [[Francesc Garau]] (1691).]]
The same year as the ''autos de fe'' of 1691, Francesc Garau, Jesuit, theologian and active participant in the inquisitorial trials, published ''la Fee Triunfante en quatro autos celebrados en Mallorca por el Santo Oficio de la Inquisición en que an salido ochenta i ocho reos, i de treinta, i siete relaiados solo uvo tres pertinaces'' (''Faith Triumphant in four acts celebrated in Majorca by the Holy Office of the Inquisition in which tried eighty-eight defendants, and of thirty-seven turned over to civil authorities only three remained stubborn''). Apart from its importance as a documentary and historical source, the book was intended to perpetuate the record and the infamy of the converts, and it contributed notably to provide an ideological basis for the segregation of the Xuetes and to perpetuate it. It was republished in 1755, used in the argumentation to limit the civil rights of the Xuetes and served as the basis of the libel of 1857, ''La Sinagoga Balear o historia de los judios mallorquines'' (''The Balearic Synagogue or the history of the Majorcan Jews''). In the 20th century, there have been abundant republications, all with an intention contrary to that of its author, given that some passages were of scandalous crudity, and lack the most elementary sensibility.

==== ''Les gramalletes'' ====
{{main|Sanbenito}}
[[File:sanbenets.jpg|thumb|Title page of the ''Relación de Sanbenitos…de Palma…'' 1755.]]
The ''gramalleta'' or ''sambenet'' ({{lang-es|[[sanbenito]]}}) was a [[tunic]] that individuals condemned by the Inquisition were forced to wear as punishment. The decorations on the ''gramalleta'' indicated what crime its bearer had committed and the punishment imposed. Once the ''autos-da-fé'' were over, a painting was created of the convicted heretic wearing the ''gramalleta'' and the name of its bearer was included in the painting. In the case of [[Majorca]], these were exhibited publicly in the cloister of St. Domingo to perpetuate and exemplify the record of the verdict.

Because of the deterioration of this public display, the Supreme Inquisition ordered its renovation on several occasions in the 17th century. The matter led to conflict because of the presence of a great number of lineages, some of which coincided with those of the nobility, but finally in 1755 the order was carried out, surely because it was now restricted to the renovation of ''sambenets'' after 1645, and that the lineages thus implicated in Judaic practices were limited strictly to Xuetes, not the broader range of people prosecuted at an earlier date. The ''sambenets'' were to remain exposed until 1820, when a group of Xuetes assaulted and burned St. Domingo.

In the same year, 1755, in which ''Faith Triumphant'' was republished, another work was published as well, the ''Relación de los sanbenitos que se han puesto, y renovado este año de 1755, en el Claustro del Real Convento de Santo Domingo, de esta Ciudad de Palma, por el Santo Oficio de la Inquisición del Reyno de Mallorca, de reos relaxados, y reconciliados publicamente por el mismo tribunal desde el año de 1645'' (''The relation of the ''sanbenitos'' that have been placed, and renovated this year of 1755, in the cloister of the royal convent of Santo Domingo, of this city of Palma, by the Holy Office of the Inquisition of the Kingdom of Majorca, of defendants ''relaxados'', and reconciled publicly be the same tribunal from the year 1645''), to insist on the necessity of not forgetting, despite the active opposition of those affected.

== The Xueta community ==
The attitude of the Inquisition, which intended to force the disappearance of the Jews by means of their forcible integration into the Christian community, in fact accomplished the opposite: it perpetuated the memory of the condemned and, by extension, of all who carried the infamous lineages, even if they were not relatives and even if they were sincere Christians, and helped create a community that, although it no longer contained Judaic element, was still obliged to maintain a strong cohesion. In contrast, the descendants of the island's other crypto-Jews, those who were not so brought to the public view, lost all notion of their origins.

But, soon after, the Xuetes regained the leading role that they had before the inquisitorial trials. Now, deprived of their religious network, and their fortunes having been requisitioned, they sought to protect commercial alliances with the nobility and the clergy, even with the functionaries of the Inquisition. The renewed energy and the political alliances achieved permitted them to fight actively for equal rights, adjusting to whatever the surrounding circumstances were.

=== The War of the Spanish Succession (1705-1715) ===
As with the rest of the island's population during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], amongst Xuetes there were both ''[[Maulets (history)|maulets]]'' — supporters of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] and ''[[botifler]]s'' — supporters of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]]. Some of the latter perceived the French dynasty as a modernizing element in terms of religion and society, since Bourbon France had never exhibited an attitude of repression and discrimination comparable to the Habsburg rule in Spain, renewed — in the case of Majorca — with [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]].

Thus, a group of Xuetes, led by Gaspar Pinya, clothing dealer and importer, supplier of the ''botifler'' nobility, was very active supporting Philip's cause. In 1711, a conspiracy financed by Pinya was discovered. He was sentenced to jail and his properties seized but, as the war ended with a Bourbon victory, he was rewarded with rights associated to the lesser nobility; this did not affect the rest of the community.

=== The republication of ''Faith Triumphant'' (1755) ===

[[File:La fe triunfante.JPG|thumb|left| Title page of the second edition of ''La Fee triunfante…'' 1755.]]
The tailor Rafel Cortes, Tomàs Forteza and the hunchback Jeroni Cortès, among others, raised a request to the Real Audiencia de Mallorca (Royal Majorcan High Court, the island's highest court) aiming to prevent the republication of ''Faith Triumphant'' in 1755, which was accepted and so the book's distribution prevented for a time. Eventually, the Inquisitors allowed distribution to be resumed.

=== The deputies of the ''Carrer'' (1773-1788) ===
[[File:Memorial xueta.jpg|thumb|Allegation in defence of the rights of the xuetes in front of the court of Charles III.]]
In 1773, the Xuetes designated a group of six deputies — popularly known by the name of ''"perruques"'' (the wigs) because of the luxurious adornment they used during their lobbying — in order to address King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] to make a claim for outright social and juridical equality with other Majorcans. In this regard, the Court decided to inquire of the Majorcan institutions, which frontally and decidedly opposed the pretensions of the descendants of the ''conversos''. A lengthy and costly trial followed, in which the parties passionately stated their cases. The documents used in this trial demonstrate the extent to which discrimination was alive and had deep ideological roots; conversely, they are also a proof of the perseverance of the Xuetes in their demands for equality.

In October 1782, the prosecutor of the Real Audiencia de Mallorca, despite being aware of the result of these deliberations favorable to the Xuetes, raised a memorandum including highly racist reasoning, proposing the suspension of the accord and the exile of the Xuetes to [[Menorca]] and to [[Cabrera, Balearic Islands|Cabrera]], where they would be confined with strong restrictions on their liberty.

[[File:Reial Cèdula 1782.jpg|thumb|left| First of the three Royal decree signed for Charles III (1782).]]
Finally, the king inclined, timidly, in favor of the Xuetes: on 29 November 1782 he signed the ''Real Cédula'' (Royal Decree) that decreed liberty of movement and residency, the elimination of all [[architecture|architectonic]] elements that distinguished the Segell district, and the prohibition of insults, mistreatment, and the use of denigrating expressions. Also, with reservations, the king showed himself to be favorable to the establishment of outright professional liberty and the participation of the Xuetes in the navy and army, but gave instructions that these dispositions would not take effect until some time had passed in order to allow the controversy to ease.

Before half a year had passed, the deputies insisted again on Xuetes gaining access to whatever occupation they sought, and reported that the insults and discrimination had not stopped. The deputies also complained about the exhibition of the ''sambenets'' at St. Domingo. The king designated a panel to study the problem; the panel proposed the withdrawal of the ''sambenets;'' the prohibition of ''Faith Triumphant;'' the dispersion throughout the city, if necessary by force, of the Xuetes and the elimination of all formal mechanisms of mutual assistance among them; access without restriction to all ecclesiastical, university and military positions; the abolition of the guilds; and the suppression of the statutes of "purity of blood", and, if this were not possible, to limit these to 100 years; these last two were proposed to be applied throughout the kingdom.

Then began a new period of consultations and a new trial, which generated in October 1785 a second ''Cédula Real'', which largely ignored the panel's proposal, and was limited to allowing access to the army and the civil administration. Finally, in 1788, a final disposition established simple equality in the exercise of whatever office, but still without a word about the university nor ecclesiastical positions. That same year, the Court and the General Inquisition took action intended to withdraw the ''sambenets'' from the cloister, but without result.

Probably the most palpable effect of the ''Cédulas Reales'' was the slow disarticulation of the Segell community (''el Carrer''). Instead, there came to be small nuclei of Xuetes among the majority of the population and, timidly, some began to establish themselves in other streets and neighbourhoods. For those remaining at Segell, the same attitudes of social discrimination, matrimonial endogamy and traditional professions were kept but, in any case, segregation was overt and public in the world of education and religion, bastions untouched by the reforms of Charles III.

=== The end of the Old Regime (1812-1868) ===
Majorca was not occupied during the Napoleonic invasion and, in contrast to the [[liberalism]] that dominated the new [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], the island became a refuge for those whose ideology was most intransigent and favorable to the Old Regime. In this context, in 1808, soldiers who had been mobilized to go to the front accused the Xuetes of being responsible for their mobilization, and assaulted the Segell district.

The 1812 Constitution, in effect through 1814, abolished the Inquisition and established the full civil equality that the Xuetes had long sought; consequently, the most active Xuetes joined the liberal cause. In 1820, when the Constitution was restored, a group of Xuetes attacked the headquarters of the Inquisition and the Santo Domingo monastery, burning the archives and the ''sambenets''. In turn, when the Constitution was again abolished in 1823, the Carrer was again raided and the shops looted. Such episodes were frequent during this period, as were similar incidents elsewhere on the island, with riots taking place in [[Felanitx]], [[Llucmajor]], [[Pollença]], [[Sóller]], and [[Campos, Majorca]].

In 1836, Onofre Cortès was appointed councilor of the Palma town hall; it was the first time since the 16th century that a Xueta had occupied a public office at such a level. Since then, it has been a regular occurrence that a Xueta holds a public office in the townhall and the Diputación Provincial.

[[File:Sinagoga Balear.jpg|thumb|Interior title page of ''La Sinagoga Balear''.]]
In 1857, ''La sinagoga balear o historia de los judios de Mallorca'' (''The Balearic synagogue or the history of the Jews of Majorca'') was published and signed by Juan de la Puerta Vizcaino. A good part of this book reproduced ''Faith Triumphant'' and would be replicated a year later with the work ''Un milagro y una mentira. Vindicación de los mallorquines cristianos de estirpe hebrea'' (''A miracle and a lie. Vindication of the Majorcan Christians of Hebrew lineage'').

Although the ideological duality within the Xueta community can be traced back to a time prior to the inquisitorial trials, it was in this context of violent sudden changes that it became clear that one faction, clearly a minority, yet influential, was declaredly liberal, later republican, and moderately anticlerical, fighting for the liquidation of all traces of discrimination; and another, probably the majority, yet almost imperceptible in historical records, was ideologically conservative, fervently religious, and wanted to go as unnoticed as possible. At root, both strategies wished to attain the same goal: the disappearance of the Xueta issue, although they wanted to resolve it in different ways: one by making the injustice visible and the other by blending into the surrounding society.

Coinciding with these progressive periods, the Xuetes formed social clubs and associations of mutual aid; it is also during this time that they gained positions &lt;!--seats??--&gt; in political institutions via the liberal parties.

=== From the First Republic to the Second Republic (1869-1936) ===
Once they could, some well-off families gave their children a high degree of intellectual education and played an important part in the artistic movements of the period. Xuetes took a leading role in the [[Renaixença]] (the revival of Catalan culture), in the defense of the Catalan language and in the recuperation of the [[Floral Games]] (Catalan/Balear literary competitions). A forerunner of this revival was Tomàs Aguiló i Cortès at the beginning of the 19th century, and some prominent successors were Tomàs Aguiló i Forteza, Marian Aguiló i Fuster, Tomàs Forteza i Cortès, and Ramón Picó i Campamar.

[[File:Mossen Tarongí.jpg|thumb|left| Portrait of [[Josep Tarongí Cortès]], (1847-1890).]]
Josep Tarongí (1847–1890), priest and writer, encountered difficulties in studying and graduating, but was ultimately ordained; because of his Xueta extraction, he obtained a position outside Majorca. He was the protagonist of the greatest 19th century polemic on the Xueta question: when he was forbidden in 1876 to preach at the church of St. Miquel, this began a polemic with Miquel Maura (also an ecclesiastic), brother of the politician [[Antonio Maura]], in which many other parties participated, and which had a great impact both on and off of the island.

Between January and October 1923, the Xueta urbanist and politician Guillem Forteza Pinya was mayor of Palma. Also, between 1927 and 1930, during the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]], that office was held by Joan Aguiló Valentí and Rafel Ignaci Cortès Aguiló.

The brief period of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was also important both because of the official [[Laïcité|laïcism]] and because a good number of the Xuetes sympathized with the new model of the state, much as their forebears had sympathized with the ideas of the Enlightenment and the liberals. During the Republic, for the first time a Xueta priest preached a sermon at the cathedral of Palma; this had great symbolic importance.

=== From the Spanish Civil War to present times (1936-today) ===
At the end of the Republican era, many Xuetes were victims of the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] repression, while many others supported Franco's Nationalist military rebellion, the latter despite the fact that, prompted by the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista]] and [[Nazi Germany]], "lists" and "inquiries" were made during the first moments of the Spanish Civil War and, later on, during [[World War II]] for an eventual deportation of the Xuetes, who were considered to be elements linked to European Jews, to extermination camps {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Allegedly, the highest Catholic official in the island, Bishop Miralles, asked for a report enlarging Xuetes numbers in a way that the number of people potentially subjected to reprisals was too large to be addressed{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In any case, this is an obscure and poorly documented episode.

Anti-Xueta prejudice continued to diminish with the opening of the island to tourism in the first decades of the 20th century, along with economic development which started by the end of the previous century. The presence—in many cases, the permanent residency—of outsiders on the island (Spaniards or foreigners) to whom the status of the Xuetes meant nothing, marked a definite point of inflection in the history of this community.

Also, in 1966, the publication of the book ''Els descendents dels Jueus Conversos de Mallorca. Quatre mots de la veritat'' (''The descendants of the converted Jews of Majorca. Four words of truth''), by Miguel Forteza Piña, brother of mayor Guillem, which made public the researches of Baruch Braunstein at the National Historical Archive in Madrid (published in the United States in the 1930s) regarding inquisitorial archives that demonstrated that in Majorca those condemned for judaizing affected more than 200 Majorcan surnames; this raised the last popular controversy over the Xueta question. It was in this moment when discriminatory attitudes ended up marginalized in the private dimension and their public expression virtually disappeared.

[[Freedom of religion]], while restricted to private practice of religion only, was legally introduced at the end of the Franco era. This made it possible for some of the Xuetes to reestablish contact with Judaism. It was also enhanced during the 1960s in some revivalist movements which did not go further than the case of Nicolau Aguiló, who in 1977 emigrated to Israel and returned to Judaism with the name [[Nissan Ben-Avraham]], later obtaining the title of rabbi. In any case, Judaism and the Xuetes have had a relation of a certain ambivalence in that dealing with Jews who have adhered to a Christian tradition had been a matter not contemplated by the political and religious authorities of Israel. They seem to give importance to the fact of the Xuetes being "of Christian tradition", while for those Xuetes interested in some form of drawing closer to world Jewry, their differentiated existence is explained only by the fact of their being "Jews". Perhaps this duality explains the existence of a syncretic Judæo-Christian cult called [[Xueta Christianity]], although very much a minority, preached by Cayetano Martí Valls.

An important event, with the advent of democracy, was the election in 1979 of Ramon Aguiló (of direct Xueta ancestry), re-elected socialist mayor of Palma until 1991, whose election by popular vote could be considered the principal evidence of the decline of discrimination, ratified by other cases, such as that of Francesc Aguiló, mayor of Campanet.

All of this, however, does not imply a complete elimination of rejection of the Xuetes, as is indicated by a poll conducted by the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] in 2001, in which 30% of Majorcans affirmed that they would not marry a Xueta, and 5% declared that they would not even want to have Xuetes as friends, numbers that, despite being high, are nuanced in that those in favor of discrimination tend to be seniors.

Several Xueta institutions have been created in recent years — the association [http://www.arcallegatjueu.com/ ARCA-Llegat Jueu]  ("Jewish Legacy"), the investigative group [http://www.memoriadelcarrer.com Memòria del Carrer], the religious group [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103319/http://www.memoriajueva.com/ Institut Rafel Valls], the magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706214513/http://www.lleonardmuntanereditor.cat/app/webroot/index.php/book/show/249 Segell] and the city of Palma has joined the [http://www.redjuderias.org/red/index.php Red de Juderias de España], ("Network of Spanish Jewries" Spanish cities with a historic Jewish presence) — altogether implying the passing of an attitude of occultation in favor of the expression of a plural reality that is naturally manifest.

A son of the community, Rabbi Nissan Ben-Avraham returned to Spain in 2010 after being ordained as a rabbi in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=168149|title=Diaspora - Jewish diaspora - The Jerusalem Post|author=|date=|website=www.jpost.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017015605/http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=168149|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
