'''''1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die''''' is a musical [[reference book]] written by Tom Moon, published in 2008.

It consists of a list of recordings, mostly albums (with some singles), arranged alphabetically by artist or composer. Each entry in the list is accompanied by a short essay followed by genre classifications, Moon's choices for "key tracks" from albums, the next recommended recording from the same artist or composer, and pointers to recordings on the list by other artists that are similar or otherwise related.

Moon also includes a postscript of "108 more recordings to know about".

Moon was a music critic at the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' for 20 years, and has contributed to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', and other publications.

==Genres==
[[rock music|Rock]] recordings dominate the list, which also includes a broad range of [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[electronica]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[opera]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[pop music|pop]], [[vocal music|vocals]], and [[world music]].

'''Pakistani subnational abbreviations''' are used by [[Pakistan Post]], currently in code system of two or more [[capital letters]] to represent the [[Administrative units of Pakistan|Administrative units]] of Pakistan.

== Current abbreviations ==
The sources of the current abbreviations vary. Some are from the initials of two of the words in the name of a province or territory, while others are from the first and final letter or from the first and some other letter in the name. All of these names are based on the [[Pakistani English|English]] form of the name. 

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
! Abbreviation !! English name !! Urdu name
|-
| '''AJK''' || [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir|Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] || {{Nastaliq|آزاد جموں و کشمیر}}
|-
| '''BA''' || [[Balochistan]] || {{Nastaliq|بلوچستان}}
|-
| '''GB''' || [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] || {{Nastaliq|گلگت بلتستان}}
|-
| '''ICT''' || [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] || {{Nastaliq|وفاقی دارالحکومت}}
|-
| '''KP''' || [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] || {{Nastaliq|خیبر پختون خواہ}}
|-
| '''PB''' || [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] || {{Nastaliq|پنجاب}}
|-
| '''SD''' || [[Sindh]] || {{Nastaliq|سندھ}}
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Usage==
These abbreviations are hardly used in postal mail, as most people only tend to write the name of the city/town and not the province. Since there is a five-digit postal code system and only four provinces, writing a provincial abbreviation is not a common practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">The '''Al-Azhar Shia Fatwa''', known in Arabic as '''The [[Shaltoot]] Fatwa''' ({{lang-ar|فتوى شلتوت}}), is an [[Islamic]] [[fatwa]] issued in 1959 on the topic of [[Shi'a–Sunni relations]] by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholar Shaikh [[Mahmood Shaltoot]]. Under Shaltoot, Sunni-Shia ecumenical activities would reach their zenith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rainer Brünner|title=Islamic Ecumenism In The 20th Century: The Azhar And Shiism Between Rapprochement And Restraint|date=2004|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004125483|page=360|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fatwa is the fruit of a decade-long collaborative effort between a group of Sunni and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] scholars at the Dar al-Taqreeb al-Madhahib al-Islamiyyah ("center for bringing together the various Islamic schools of thought") theological center at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]]. The aim of the effort is to bridge the gap between the various Islamic schools of thought, and to foster mutual respect, understanding and appreciation of each school's contributions to the development of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter1b/14.html|title=al-Azhar Verdict on the Shia|publisher=www.al-islam.org|accessdate=2009-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613065916/http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter1b/14.html| archivedate= 13 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the ecumenical fatwa, while Shaltoot was [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]] he refused to establish an independent Shia chair at the University, which was one of the greatest aspirations, especially, of the Shia members of the Dar al-Taqreeb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rainer Brünner|title=Islamic Ecumenism In The 20th Century: The Azhar And Shiism Between Rapprochement And Restraint|date=2004|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004125483|page=301|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rare fatwa, which admits [[Shia Muslim]]s, [[Alawite]]s, and [[Druze]], who had been considered heretics and idolaters for hundreds of years, into mainstream Islam has been viewed as being inspired by  Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aburish|first=Saïd K.|title=Nasser: the last Arab|date=2004|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=9780715633007|pages=200–201|edition=illustrated|quote=But perhaps the most far reaching change [initiated by Nasser’s guidance] was the fatwa commanding the readmission to mainstream Islam of the Shia, Alawis, and Druze. They had been considered heretics and idolaters for hundreds of years, but Nasser put an end to this for once and for all. While endearing himself to the majority Shia of Iraq and undermining Kassem [the communist ruler of Iraq at the time] might have played a part in that decision, there is no doubting the liberalism of the man in this regard.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser saw it as a tool to spread his appeal and influence across the entire Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddie|first=Nikki R|title=Iran and the Surrounding World: Interactions in Culture and Cultural Politics|date=2002|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=9780295982069|page=306|edition=illustrated|author2=Rudolph P Matthee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, due to drift towards [[Salafism]] in Al-Azhar, the dean of the [[Faculty of Islamic Studies at Al-Azhar]] issued a fatwa strongly opposed to the 1959 fatwa. It forbade worship according to the Shia tradition and condemned as heretics anyone who insulted the wives or companions of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Al-Azhar also published a book condemning the Shia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Araby|first=Mohamed|title=Identity politics, Egypt and the Shia|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/2376/21/Identity-politics,-Egypt-and-the-Shia.aspx|work=Al-Ahram Weekly|accessdate=20 April 2014|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shaykh [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]] of Jamia Al'Azhar again reiterated Shaikh Shaltoot's position in an interview &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ijtihadnet.com/fatwa-al-azhars-grand-imam-shia/|work=AlNeel TV|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''American Art Directory''''' is a yearly publication covering [[art museum]]s, [[Arts centre|arts centers]], and [[Art school|art educational institutions]] as well as news, obituaries, book and magazine publications, etc. related to the artistic community in the [[United States]].  Established in 1898, it was originally entitled ''American Art Annual''.

Art consultant, advisor, author, and independent appraiser [[Alan Bamberger]] describes the Directory as "...a required reference for art museums, libraries, arts organizations, art schools, and corporations with art holdings."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}, archived by [[WebCite]] &lt;/ref&gt;

A yearly feature is the "Review of the Year" article discussing the touring exhibitions, commissions, grants to organizations, construction starts at museums and other facilities, and various other events that occur within the art community.

Initially the directory was the work of the [[New York City|New York]] area artist [[Florence Nightingale Levy]] and published by [[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{Citation

In 1952 the ''American Art Annual'' was split into two separate publications, ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'' and the ''American Art Directory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Case background ==

[[Texaco]] is a for-profit corporation, that maintained an internal library and employed a number of scientists.  Texaco subscribed to journals by the [[American Geophysical Union]], a scholarly society that publishes a number of journals.  Texaco also purchased a photocopy license from the [[Copyright Clearance Center]] (CCC), an entity that licenses academic content to research organizations.&lt;ref name="casarez-647"&gt;Cásarez at 644.&lt;/ref&gt;  Texaco, like many entities with institutional libraries, was in the practice of photocopying articles from its journals to send to employees.

The AGU and five other publishers, eventually joined by several dozen other publishers, sued Texaco.&lt;ref name="casarez-647"/&gt; Texaco defended, citing the [[fair use]] doctrine, which holds that uses found to be "fair," "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research," are not infringements of copyright.&lt;ref name="s107"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107 17 U.S.C. Section 107], Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ultimately deemed Texaco's use to not be fair use, and Texaco was fined and agreed to retroactively purchase a license from the Copyright Clearance Center.&lt;ref name="Appeal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright &amp; Photocopies|url=http://www.copyright.com/Services/CorporateGuide/photocopies_frameset.htm|publisher=Copyright Clearance Cente|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Circuit's fair-use analysis weighed heavily the "fourth factor",&lt;ref name="casarez-647"&gt;Cásarez at 644.&lt;/ref&gt; which considers "the effect of the use upon the potential market for ... the copyrighted work."&lt;ref name="s107" /&gt; Because CCC made licenses available for the photocopying, the court held that Texaco's failure to use those licenses for all its photocopying deprived the rightsholders of lost licensing revenue.&lt;ref name="casarez-647" /&gt;  This portion of the opinion has been criticized for its circularity of reasoning: Since any use could in theory be licensed, any unlicensed use would weigh against fair use on the market harm factor.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt;

'''Anycast''' is a network [[addressing]] and [[routing]] methodology in which a single destination address has multiple routing paths to two or more endpoint destinations. Routers will select the desired path on the basis of number of hops, distance, lowest cost, latency measurements or based on the least congested route. Anycast networks are widely used for [[content delivery network]] (CDN) products to bring their content closer to the end user.

==Addressing methods==
{{routing scheme}}
The [[Internet Protocol]] and other network addressing systems recognize five main addressing methods:
*[[Unicast]] addressing uses a ''one-to-one'' association between a sender and destination: each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint.
*[[Broadcast (networking)|Broadcast]] uses a ''one-to-all'' association; a single datagram from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the broadcast address. The network automatically replicates datagrams as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.
*[[Multicast]] addressing uses a ''one-to-many-of-many'' or ''many-to-many-of-many'' association; datagrams are routed simultaneously in a single transmission to many recipients.  It differs from broadcast in that the destination address designates a subset, not necessarily all, of the accessible nodes.
*'''Anycast''' addressing is a ''one-to-one-of-many'' association where datagrams are routed to any single member of a group of potential receivers that are all identified by the same destination address.  The routing algorithm selects the single receiver from the group based on least-expensive routing metric. In practice, this means that packets are routed to the topologically-nearest member of an anycast group.
*[[Geocast]] refers to the delivery of information to a group of destinations in a network identified by their geographical locations. It is a specialized form of multicast addressing used by some routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.

==Internet Protocol version 4==
Anycast is not specifically supported by [[IPv4]], but this omission can be [[workaround|worked around]] in many cases by using [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP). Multiple hosts (usually in different geographic areas) are given the same unicast IP address and different routes to the address are announced through BGP.  Routers consider these to be alternative routes to the same destination, though they are actually routes to different destinations with the same address. As usual, routers select a route by whatever distance metric is in use (the least cost, least congested, shortest).  Selecting a route in this setup amounts to selecting a destination.

The pitfall of this approach is that a connection to an anycast address may fail because the network can change the routing of packets in mid-connection due to congestion or changes in the network, with the result that the destination changes mid-connection, though the new destination is not aware of the connection and is not maintaining the connection state.  These conditions are typically referred to as a "[[Point of presence|PoP]] switch". With a normal unicast address a routing change would not be a problem, as this merely results in a different route to the same eventual destination.  All packets within a connection do not normally need to follow the same path. But when the address is actually an anycast address masquerading as a unicast address (as in this design), a routing change could be a destination change.

Because of the possibility of a "PoP switch" in IPv4, anycast is generally used with [[connectionless protocol]]s based on [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], as a way to provide [[high availability]] and load  balancing for [[stateless server|stateless]] services. For example, one of the well-known applications of IPv4 anycast is the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).  This is well-suited to anycast because it is a UDP-based service providing connectionless access to domain name data which is replicated across multiple, geographically-dispersed, stateless servers, with severe demands for availability and [[scalability]].

Because anycast is more error-prone with [[connection-oriented protocol]]s such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] where the destination maintains [[state (computer science)|state]], it is less commonly used with these protocols.  Some custom IP stacks use proprietary methods to provide healing of stateful protocols when necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prince|first1=Matthew|url=http://blog.cloudflare.com/a-brief-anycast-primer#comment-879815852|title=CEO Comment on CloudFlare Blog|website=CloudFlare Blog|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; mitigating problems due to anycast PoP switches.

==Internet Protocol version 6==
Anycast is supported explicitly in [[IPv6]]. {{IETF RFC|4291}}, which covers IPv6 addressing architecture, reserves Interface Identifier 0 within an IPv6 subnet as the "Subnet Router" anycast address.  In addition, {{IETF RFC|2526}} reserves a block of 128 Interface Identifiers within a subnet as anycast addresses.

Most IPv6 routers on the path of an anycast packet through the network will not distinguish it from a unicast packet, but special handling is required from the routers near the destination (that is, within the scope of the anycast address) as they are required to route an anycast packet to the "nearest" interface within that scope which has the proper anycast address, according to whatever measure of distance (hops, cost, etc.) is being used.

The method used in IPv4 of advertising multiple routes in BGP to multiply-assigned unicast addresses also still works in IPv6, and can be used to route packets to the nearest of several geographically dispersed hosts with the same address.  This approach, which does not depend on anycast-aware routers,  has the same use-cases together with the same problems and limitations as in IPv4.

==Applications==
With the growth of the Internet, network services increasingly have high-availability requirements. As a result, operation of anycast services ({{IETF RFC|4786}}) has grown in popularity among network operators.&lt;ref name="RFC4783"&gt;{{cite web
   | url        = http://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc4786.pdf

   | accessdate = 21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain Name System===
All Internet [[root nameserver]]s are implemented as clusters of hosts using anycast addressing. All thirteen root servers A–M exist in multiple locations, with eleven on multiple continents. (Root servers B and H exist in two U.S. locations.&lt;ref&gt;Home-page [http://www.isi.edu/b-root/ B-root DNS server], visited 8 Feb. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This has accelerated the deployment of physical (rather than logical) root servers outside the [[United States]]. {{IETF RFC|3258}} documents the use of anycast addressing to provide authoritative [[DNS]] services. Many commercial DNS providers have switched to an IP anycast environment to increase query performance and redundancy, and to implement load balancing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===IPv6 transition===
In [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|IPv4 to IPv6 transitioning]], anycast addressing may be deployed to provide IPv6 compatibility to IPv4 hosts. This method, [[6to4]], uses a default gateway with the IP address 192.88.99.1, as described in {{IETF RFC|3068}}. This allows multiple providers to implement [[6to4]] gateways without hosts having to know each individual provider's gateway addresses.

===Content delivery networks===
[[Content delivery network]]s may use anycast for actual [[HTTP]] connections to their distribution centers, or for [[Domain Name System|DNS]]. Because most HTTP connections to such networks request static content such as images and style sheets, they are generally short-lived and stateless across subsequent TCP sessions. The general stability of routes and statelessness of connections makes anycast suitable for this application, even though it uses [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Security==
Anycast allows any operator whose routing information is accepted by an intermediate router to hijack any packets intended for the anycast address. While this at first sight appears insecure, it is no different from the routing of ordinary [[Internet Protocol|IP packets]], and no more or less secure. As with conventional IP routing, careful filtering of who is and is not allowed to propagate route announcements is crucial to prevent [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] or [[Packet drop attack|blackhole attack]]s. The former can also be prevented by encrypting and authenticating messages, such as using [[Transport Layer Security]], while the latter can be frustrated by [[onion routing]].

==Reliability==
Anycast is normally highly reliable, as it can provide automatic [[failover]].  Anycast applications typically feature external "heartbeat" monitoring of the server's function, and withdraw the route announcement if the server fails. In some cases this is done by the actual servers announcing the anycast prefix to the router over [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] or another [[Interior gateway protocol|IGP]]. If the servers die, the router will automatically withdraw the announcement.

"Heartbeat" functionality is important because, if the announcement continues for a failed server, the server will act as a "black hole" for nearby clients; this failure mode is the most serious mode of failure for an anycast system. Even in this event, this kind of failure will only cause a total failure for clients that are closer to this server than any other, and will not cause a global failure.&lt;!-- howso? --&gt;

==Mitigation of denial-of-service attacks==
In [[denial-of-service attack]]s, a rogue network host may advertise itself as an anycast server for a vital network service, to provide false information or simply block service.

Anycast methodologies on the Internet may be exploited to distribute [[DDoS]] attacks and reduce their effectiveness:  As traffic is routed to the closest node, a process over which the attacker has no control, the DDoS traffic flow will be distributed amongst the closest nodes.  Thus, not all nodes might be affected.  This may be a reason to deploy anycast addressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   | url        = http://www.icann.org/announcements/factsheet-dns-attack-08mar07_v1.1.pdf
   | title      = ICANN Factsheet on root server attack on 6 February 2007

   | date       = 1 March 2007
   | accessdate = 21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of this technique to divert attacks is questionable, however, because unicast addresses (used for maintenance) can be easy to obtain, at least on [[IPv6]]. Now obsoleted {{IETF RFC|2373}} defined that "An anycast address must not be used as the source address of an IPv6 packet." Therefore, pinging an anycast address will return the [[unicast]] address of the closest node, since the reply must come from a unicast address. An attacker can then attack individual nodes from any location, bypassing anycast addressing methods. This same method works on some, but not all, IPv4 anycast addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   | accessdate = 3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IETF RFC|2373}} also restricted anycast IPv6 addresses to routers only. However, both of these restrictions were lifted in {{IETF RFC|4291}}.

Authentication of anycast transmissions may solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Local and global nodes==
Some anycast deployments on the Internet distinguish between local and global nodes to benefit the local community, by addressing local nodes preferentially. An example is the Domain Name System. Local nodes are often announced with the no-export [[BGP]] community to prevent hosts from announcing them to their peers, i.e. the announcement is kept in the local area. Where both local and global nodes are deployed, the announcements from global nodes are often [[Autonomous system (Internet)|AS]] prepended (i.e. the AS is added a few more times) to make the path longer so that a local node announcement is preferred over a global node announcement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The '''arms industry''', also known as the '''defense industry''' or the '''arms trade''', is a global [[industry classification|industry]] responsible for the [[manufacturing]] and sales of [[weapon]]s and [[military technology]]. It consists of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[industry]] involved in the [[research and development]], [[engineering]], production, and servicing of [[military]] material, equipment, and facilities. Arms-producing companies, also referred to as  '''arms dealers''', '''defence contractors''', or as the '''military industry''', produce arms for the [[armed forces]] of [[State (polity)|states]] and civilians. Departments of government also operate in the arms industry, buying and selling weapons, munitions and other military items. An [[arsenal]] is a place where arms and ammunition are made, maintained and repaired, stored, or issued, in any combination, whether privately or publicly owned. Products include [[gun]]s, [[artillery]], [[ammunition]], [[missile]]s, [[military aircraft]], [[military vehicle]]s, [[Naval ship|ship]]s, [[electronics|electronic systems]], [[night vision devices]], [[holographic weapon sight]]s, [[laser rangefinder]]s, [[laser sight]]s, [[hand grenades]], [[landmines]] and more. The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support.

[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) estimated that 2012 military expenditures were roughly $1.8 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2013/03 SIPRI Yearbook 2013]. www.sipri.org. Retrieved on 2016-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a relative decline from 1990 when military expenditures made up 4% of world GDP. Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry. The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies amounted to an estimated $395 billion in 2012 according to SIPRI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198712596/sipri-9780198712596-chapter-5-div1-6.xml# Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]. Sipri.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 over $30 billion were spent in the international arms trade (a figure that excludes domestic sales of arms).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4238644.stm Arms trade key statistics]. BBC News (2005-09-15). Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; According to SIPRI, the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010–14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005–2009. The five biggest exporters in 2010–2014 were the United States, Russia, China, Germany and France, and the five biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title= Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014|url= https://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|website= www.sipri.org|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate= 18 March 2015|ref= SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[industrialized countries]] have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens, primarily for self-defence, hunting or sporting purposes. [[Small arms trade|Illegal trade in small arms]] occurs in many countries and regions affected by [[political instability]]. The [[Small Arms Survey]] estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide, produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/weapons-and-markets.html|title= Small Arms Survey&amp;nbsp;— Weapons and Markets- 875m small arms worldwide, value of authorized trade is more than $8.5b|date= 8 December 2014|publisher= |accessdate= 26 March 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts to supply a given country's military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance. The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described as a [[military-industrial complex]], where the armed forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked, similarly to the [[European multilateral defence procurement]]. Various corporations, some publicly held, others private, bid for these contracts, which are often worth many billions of dollars. Sometimes, as with the contract for the international [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]], a competitive tendering process takes place, with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved. Other times, no bidding or competition takes place.

==History==
{{further information|Military production during World War II}}
[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30035.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Painting shells in a shell filling factory during [[World War I]].]]

During the [[early modern period]], France, United Kingdom, Netherlands and some states in Germany became self-sufficient in arms production, with diffusion and migration of skilled workers to more peripheral countries such as Portugal and Russia.

The modern arms industry emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as a product of the creation and expansion of the first large [[military-industrial complex|military-industrial]] companies. As smaller countries (and even newly industrializing countries like Russia and Japan) could no longer produce cutting-edge military equipment with their indigenous resources and capacity, they increasingly began to contract the manufacture of military equipment, such as [[battleship]]s, [[artillery|artillery pieces]] and [[rifle]]s to foreign firms.

In 1854, the [[British government]] awarded a contract to the [[Elswick Ordnance Company]] of industrialist [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] for the supply of his latest breech loading rifled artillery pieces. This galvanised the private sector into weapons production, with the surplus being increasingly exported to foreign countries. Armstrong became one of the first international arms dealers, selling his weapon systems to governments across the world from Brazil to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamarmstrong.info/about-the-man|title=William George Armstrong (1810–1900)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he opened a shipyard at [[Elswick Ordnance Company|Elswick]] to specialise in warship production—at the time, it was the only factory in the world that could build a battleship and arm it completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dougan, David |year=1970 |title=The Great Gun-Maker: The Story of Lord Armstrong|publisher=Sandhill Press Ltd. |isbn=0-946098-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory produced warships for many navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Several Armstrong cruisers played an important role in defeating the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.

In the American Civil War in 1861 the north had a distinct advantage over the south as it relied on using the breech-loading rifle against the muskets of the south. This began the transition to industrially produced mechanised weapons such as the Gatling gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Defense Industries - Military History - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|url = http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791279/obo-9780199791279-0036.xml|website = www.oxfordbibliographies.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This industrial innovation in the defence industry was adopted by [[Prussia]] in 1866 &amp; 1870-71 in its defeat of Austria and France respectively. By this time the machine gun had begun entering into the militaries. The first example of its effectiveness was in 1899 during the [[Boer war|Boer War]] and in 1905 during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. However, Germany were leaders in innovation of weapons and used this innovation nearly defeating the allies in [[World War I]].

In 1885, France decided to capitalize on this increasingly lucrative form of trade and repealed its ban on weapon exports. The regulatory framework for the period up to the [[First World War]] was characterized by a [[laissez-faire]] policy that placed little obstruction in the way of weapons exports. Due to the carnage of World War I, arms traders began to be regarded with odium as "merchants of death" and were accused of having instigated and perpetuated the war in order to maximise their profits from arms sales. An inquiry into these allegations in Britain failed to find evidence to support them. However, the sea change in attitude about war more generally meant that governments began to control and regulate the trade themselves.
[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30049.jpg|thumb|Stacks of shells in the shell filling factory at Chilwell during World War I.]]
The volume of the arms trade greatly increased during the 20th century, and it began to be used as a political tool, especially during the [[Cold War]] where the United States and the USSR supplied weapons to their proxies across the world, particularly [[Third World|third world countries]] (see [[Nixon Doctrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvGRBE1QxBUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The International Arms Trade|author1=Stohl, Rachel |author2=Grillot, Suzette |year=2013|publisher=Wiley Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sectors==
[[File:AK47.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[AK-47|AK]] series of weapons have been produced in greater numbers than any other [[firearm]] and have been used in conflicts all over the world.]]

===Land-based weapon===
This category includes everything from [[SALW|light arms]] to [[heavy artillery]], and the majority of producers are small. Many are located in third world countries. International trade in [[handgun]]s, [[machine gun]]s, [[tanks]], [[armored personnel carrier]]s, and other relatively inexpensive weapons is substantial. There is relatively little regulation at the international level, and as a result, many weapons fall into the hands of organized crime, rebel forces, terrorists, or regimes under sanctions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2584/newsletter_info.htm |title=International Defense Industry |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062433/http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2584/newsletter_info.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}. www.fpa.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Small arms====
{{main article|Small arms trade}}
The [[Control Arms Campaign]], founded by [[Amnesty International]], [[Oxfam]], and the [[IANSA (NGO)|International Action Network on Small Arms]], estimated in 2003 that there are over 639 million small arms in circulation, and that over 1,135 companies based in more than 98 different countries manufacture small arms as well as their various components and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Aerospace systems===
[[File:MDD T-45 assembly line c1988.jpeg|thumb|A [[T-45 Goshawk]] on the assembly line at [[McDonnell Douglas]].]]
{{Main article|Aerospace manufacturer}}
Encompassing military aircraft (both land-based and [[naval aviation]]), conventional missiles, and [[military satellites]], this is the most technologically advanced sector of the market. It is also the least competitive from an economic standpoint, with a handful of companies dominating the entire market. The top clients and major producers are virtually all located in the [[western world]] and Russia, with the United States easily in first place. Prominent aerospace firms include [[Rolls Royce plc|Rolls Royce]], [[BAE]], [[Dassault Aviation]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Mikoyan]], [[EADS]], [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]], [[Thales Group]], [[Lockheed Martin]],  [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Boeing]]. There are also several [[multinational corporation|multinational]] consortia mostly involved in the manufacturing of [[fighter jet]]s, such as the [[Eurofighter]]. The largest military contract in history, signed in October 2001, involved the development of the [[Joint Strike Fighter]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Naval systems===
Some of the world's [[great power]]s maintain substantial [[naval force]]s to provide a global presence, with the largest nations possessing [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[nuclear submarine]]s and advanced [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-air defense systems]]. The vast majority of military ships are conventionally powered, but some are [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]]. There is also a large global market in second-hand naval vessels, generally purchased by [[developing countries]] from [[Western world|Western]] governments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Cybersecurity industry ==
{{main article|Computer security}}
The cybersecurity industry is becoming the most important defence industry as cyber attacks are being deemed as one of the greatest risk to defence in the next ten years as cited by the NATO review in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2013/Industry/EN/index.htm|title = NATO review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, high levels of investment has been placed in the cybersecurity industry to produce new software to protect the ever-growing transition to digitally run hardware. For the military industry it is vital that protections are used for systems used for reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence gathering. However, to protect the cyber world from attacks there are advanced cyber protection strategies used such as content, cloud and wireless security. These can be intertwined to form several secure layers.

Nevertheless, cyber attacks and cyber attackers have become more advanced in their field using techniques such as Dynamic Trojan Horse Network (DTHN) Internet Worm, [[Zero-Day Attack]], and Stealth Bot. As a result, the cybersecurity industry has had to improve the defence technologies to remove any vulnerability to cyber attacks using systems such as the Security of Information (SIM), Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) and [[DDoS]] techniques.

As the threat to computers grows, the demand for cyber protection will rise, resulting in the growth of the cybersecurity industry. It is expected that the industry will be dominated by the defence and homeland security agencies that will make up 40% of the industry.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Cyber security for the defence industry {{!}} Cyber Security Review|url = http://www.cybersecurity-review.com/industry-perspective/cyber-security-for-the-defence-industry|website = www.cybersecurity-review.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International arms transfers==
According to research institute, [[SIPRI]], the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010–14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005–2009. The five biggest exporters in 2010–14 were the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and France, and the five biggest importers were India, Saudi Arabia, China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan. The flow of arms to Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East increased significantly between 2005–2009 and 2010–14, while there was a notable decrease in the flow to Europe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

SIPRI has identified 60 countries as exporters of major weapons in 2010–14. The top 5 exporters during the period were responsible for almost 74 per cent of all arms exports. The composition of the five largest exporters of arms changed between 2005–2009 and 2010–14: while the United States and Russia remained by far the largest exporters, China narrowly, but notably, replaced Germany as the third largest exporter as Germany slid down to 6th place. The top 5 exported 14 per cent more arms in 2010–14 than the top 5 in 2005–2009.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2010–14, 153 countries (about three-quarters of all countries) imported major weapons. The top 5 recipients accounted for 33 per cent of the total arms imports during the period (see table 2). India, China and the UAE were among the top 5 importers in both 2005–2009 and 2010–14. Asia and Oceania accounted for nearly half of imports in 2010–14, followed by the Middle East, Europe, the Americas and Africa (see figure 3). SIPRI also identified seven groups of rebel forces as importers of major weapons in 2010–14, but none of them accounted for more than 0.02 per cent of total deliveries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Please note that rankings for exporters below a billion dollars are less meaningful, as they can be swayed by single contracts. A much more accurate picture of export volume, free from yearly fluctuations, is presented by 5-year moving averages.

Next to SIPRI there are several other sources that provide data on international transfers of arms. These include national reports by national governments about arms exports, the UN register on conventional arms and an annual publication by the [[US Congressional Research Service|U.S. Congressional Research Service]] that includes data on arms exports to developing countries as compiled by [[US intelligence|U.S. intelligence]] agencies. A list of such sources can be found at the SIPRI website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipri.org/contents/armstrad/ armstrad — www.sipri.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520090124/http://www.sipri.org/contents/armstrad/ |date=May 20, 2005 }}. Sipri.org. Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the different methodologies and definitions used different sources often provide significantly different data. 

=== World’s biggest postwar arms exporter===

Please note that arms import rankings fluctuate heavily as countries enter and exit wars. Export data tend to be less volatile as exporters tend to be more technologically advanced and have stable production flows. 5-year moving averages present a much more accurate picture of import volume, free from yearly fluctuations.

==Arms control==
{{main article|Arms control}}
Arms control refers to international restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of small arms, conventional weapons, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Arms Control? |url=http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/defense/a/what-is-arms-control.htm |work=About.com, US Foreign Policy |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Barry Kolodkin |format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically exercised through the use of [[diplomacy]], which seeks to persuade [[government]]s to accept such limitations through agreements and [[Treaty|treaties]], although it may also be forced upon non-consenting governments.

The Italian poet [[Petrarch]] wrote about his ascent of [[Mont Ventoux]] (in Provence; elevation 1912 meters) on 26 April 1336 in a well-known letter published as one of his ''[[Epistolae familiares]]'' (IV, 1). In this letter, written around 1350, Petrarch claimed to be the first person since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] to have climbed a mountain for the view. Although the historical accuracy of his account has been questioned by modern scholars, it is often cited in discussions of the new spirit of the [[Renaissance]].

==Contents==
Petrarch's letter is addressed to his former confessor, [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]]. It says he ascended the mountain with his brother Gherardo and two servants, exactly ten years after they had left Bologna. They began at the village of [[Malaucène]] at the foot of the mountain. On the way up they met an old shepherd, who said he had climbed the mountain some fifty years before, finding only rocks and brambles, and that no-one else had done it before or since. The brothers continued, Gherardo continuing up the ridge they were following, Petrarch ever trying for an easier, if longer, path.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch himself applies this to his spiritual failures; this passage is one of the reasons the whole letter is regarded as [[allegory]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the top, they found a peak called ''Filiolus'', "Little Son"; Petrarch reflected on the past ten years, and the waste of his earthly love for Laura. They looked out from here, seeing the [[Rhone]] and the [[Cévennes]], but not the [[Pyrenees]] (which are 200 miles away). At this point, Petrarch sat down and opened his Augustine, and immediately came upon "People are moved to wonder by mountain peaks, by vast waves of the sea, by broad waterfalls on rivers, by the all-embracing extent of the ocean, by the revolutions of the stars. But in themselves they are uninterested." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Augustine/confessions/L10#10.8.15 ''Confessions'' X.8.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch fell silent on this trip down, reflecting on the vanity of human wishes and the nobility of uncorrupted human thought. When they arrived back in the village in the middle of the night, Petrarch wrote this letter "hastily and extemporaneously" - or so he says.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp.102-112; quotes and translation from Bishop, as are the choice of points to summarize and the comment on the Pyrenees.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic doubts==
It is often claimed that Petrarch was the first to climb Mont Ventoux, although he did not suggest so himself. The mountain was likely already climbed in prehistoric times and there is even a slightly older written account of an ascent, by [[Jean Buridan]], who on his way to the papal court in [[Avignon]] before the year 1334 climbed Mt. Ventoux "in order to make some meteorological observations".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest A. Moody [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/Dictionary%20of%20Scientific%20Biography/08.%20Buridan%20b.%20ca.%201295%20(Moody).pdf Jean Buridan] in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmelman, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9F03E2DC153EF935A35755C0A96F958260 "NOT Because it's There"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 6, 1999. See also [[Lynn Thorndike]], pp. 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt; It further seems implausible that Petrarch sat down and wrote the six thousand words we have, in elegant Latin with correct quotations from the classical poets, before dinner after an eighteen-hour hike up and down a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;So Bishop, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, whether Petrarch himself climbed the mountain has been doubted by modern scholars; according to Pierre Courcelle and Giuseppe Billanovich, the letter is essentially a fiction written almost fifteen years after its supposed date, and almost a decade after the death of its addressee, Francesco Dionigi da Borgo San Sepulcro.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, Michael, "Authority and the Truth of Experience in Petrarch's 'Ascent of Mount Ventoux,'" ''[[Philological Quarterly]]'', 62 (1983), p.507, citing Billanovich, Giuseppe. "Petrarca e il Ventuso," ''Italia medioevale e umanisrica'' 9 (1966), pp. 389-401, and Courcelle, Pierre, "Petrarque entre Saint Augustin et les Augustins du XIVe siecle," ''Studipetrarcheschi'' 7 (1961), pp. 51-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell Asher argued, indeed, that the ascent of the mountain was a [[figure of speech|figurative]] account of writing the letter itself.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, Lyell, '' Petrarch at the Peak of Fame''; PMLA, Vol. 108, No. 5. (Oct., 1993), pp. 1050-1063.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reception==
[[Jakob Burckhardt]], in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' declared Petrarch "a truly modern man", because of the significance of nature for his "receptive spirit"; even if he did not yet have the skill to describe nature.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, ''Civilization'', Part IV §3, beginning. [http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/4-3.html convenience link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203015126/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/4-3.html |date=February 3, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch's implication that he was the first to climb mountains for pleasure,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Bishop, p.104:"the first recorded Alpinist, the first to climb a mountain because it is there."&lt;/ref&gt; and Burckhardt's insistence on Petrarch's sensitivity to nature have been often repeated since.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.  Kimmelman, who sees Petrarch's letter as early environmental writing.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous references to Petrarch as an "alpinist",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Ernst Cassirer]]: ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man'', tr. Hans Nachod, p.28:"The colorful description of this enterprise has startled many readers who have been amazed to see a man of his epoch venturing to climb a mountain for a view like a modern alpinist"&lt;/ref&gt;  although [[Mont Ventoux]] is not a hard climb, and is not usually considered part of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.102,104&lt;/ref&gt; This implicit claim of Petrarch and Burckhardt, that Petrarch  was the first to climb a mountain for pleasure since antiquity, was disproven by [[Lynn Thorndike]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, pp. 69-74&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Legitimacy of the Modern Age'' by [[Hans Blumenberg]] describes Petrarch's ascent of Ventoux as "one of the great moments that oscillate indecisively between the epochs," namely between the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period and [[Early modern Europe|modernity]]. He also uses it to illustrate his theory of intellectual history: "The description of the ascent of Mont Ventoux exemplifies graphically what is meant by the 'reality' of history as the reoccupation of formal systems of positions."&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, pp. 341, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hillman]], in ''[[Re-Visioning Psychology]]'', uses the story of Petrarch's ascent to illustrate his argument that 
the outer world of nature is mirrored by an equally vast inner world of images.  Both worlds exist apart from the human being.  The outer world may have motivated Petrarch to climb Mont Ventoux, but the inner world is what he discovered when he reached the top and read the passage from Augustine's ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''.

The '''Azerbaijan State Agriculture Museum''', established in 1924, presents the history of agricultural development in [[Azerbaijan]] and reflects its current state. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.azerbaijan.com/v/exhibitions/ Exhibitions], www.azerbaijan.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has more than 10,000 [[Exhibit (educational)|exhibit]]s and mostly describes agricultural tools, both traditional and modern, and models of [[Harvesting|harvester]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum exposition covers various fields of [[agriculture]]: crop growing, [[cattle]] breeding, and [[horticulture]]. A variety of exhibits are devoted to [[ethnography]]: documents and photos as well as facilities reflecting the traditional way of [[rural life]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.azerbaijan.com/v/exhibitions/ Exhibitions], www.azerbaijan.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an old hand-mill for grinding flour which is more than 100 years old and an [[oil lamp]] of the same age, a stone extracting [[grape juice]], ceramic jugs for milk whipping and butter production and [[stirrup]]s, [[saddle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two maps in the museum that has been embroidered with [[silk]] threads and the other one has been made of [[wheat]] grains, [[lentil]]s and [[watercress]].&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum guides wear [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] national garments and traditional music is played in the halls of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum regularly features documentary film screenings and lectures, and organizes travelling exhibitions. The Azerbaijani State Agriculture Museum is especially popular among students of various educational institutions for whom special thematic visits and lessons are organized where they are able to experience the stages of development of agriculture in [[Azerbaijan]]. The museum is interesting for both children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A six-story above-ground glass-enclosed tower of [[book stack]]s is encased by a windowless façade, supported by four monolithic [[pier (architecture)|pier]]s at the corners of the building. The exterior shell is structurally supported by a steel frame with pylons embedded {{convert|50|ft|m}} to [[bedrock]] at each corner pier. The façade is constructed of [[translucent]] [[vein (geology)|veined]] [[marble]] and granite. The marble  is milled to a thickness of {{convert|1.25|in|mm}} and was quarried from [[Danby, Vermont]]. On a sunny day the marble transmits filtered daylight to the interior in a subtle golden amber glow, a product of its thin profile. These panels are framed by a hexagonal grid of Vermont Woodbury granite veneer, fastened  to a structural steel frame. The outside dimensions have "[[Platonic idealism|Platonic]]" mathematical proportions of 1:2:3 (height: width: length). The building has been called a "jewel box",&lt;ref name=OLTour&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Library Building: Online Tour|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brblinfo/brblslides_tour.html|work=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|publisher=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waytkus&gt;{{cite web|last=Waytkus|first=Liz|title=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/register/fiche/beinecke_rare_book_and_manuscript_library|work=docomomo_us|publisher=Docomomo US|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a "laboratory for the humanities".&lt;ref name="Fellman" /&gt; The Modernist structure contains furniture designed by [[Florence Knoll]] and [[Marcel Breuer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronin|first1=Brena|title=Library of Treasures Gets an Overhaul|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 22, 2016|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An elevated public exhibition mezzanine surrounds the glass stack tower, and displays among other things, one of the 48 extant copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].&lt;ref name="Waytkus"/&gt; Two basement floors extend under much of Hewitt Quadrangle. The first sub-grade level, the "Court" level, centers on a [[sunken courtyard]] in front of the Beinecke, which features ''The Garden (Pyramid, Sun, and Cube)''.  These are abstract allegorical sculptures by [[Isamu Noguchi]] that are said to represent time (the pyramid), sun (the disc), and chance (the cube).&lt;ref name=PubArt&gt;{{cite web|title=The Garden (Pyramid, Sun, and Cube)|url=http://www.yale.edu/publicart/noguchi.html|work=Public Art at Yale|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=2012-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630080757/http://www.yale.edu/publicart/noguchi.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This level also features a secure [[reference library|reading room]] for visiting researchers, administrative offices, and book storage areas. The level of the building two floors below ground has movable-aisle compact shelving for books and archives.&lt;ref name=Kopley&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kopley|first=Emily|title=Beneath the Beinecke|magazine=The New Journal: The Magazine about Yale and New Haven, since 1967|date=Nov 2005|url=http://www.thenewjournalatyale.com/2005/11/beneath-the-beinecke/|accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beinecke is one of the larger buildings in America devoted entirely to rare books and manuscripts.{{cn|date=February 2017}} The library has room in the central tower for 180,000 volumes and room for over 1,000,000 volumes in the underground book stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/about/about-building|title=About the Building {{!}} Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|website=beinecke.library.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library's collection, which is housed both in the library's main building and at Yale University's Library Shelving Facility in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], totals roughly 1 million volumes and several million manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|title=About the Building|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/about/about-building|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the [[Claes Oldenburg]] sculpture ''Lipstick on Caterpillar Tracks (Ascending)'' was displayed in Hewitt Quadrangle. The sculpture has since been moved to the courtyard of [[Morse College]], one of the university's residential dormitories.

The elegance of the Beinecke later inspired the glass-walled structure that protects and displays the original core collection (the books gifted by [[King George III]] and referred to as the [[King's Library]]) within the [[British Library]] building in [[Euston Road|Euston]], [[London]].

==History==
In the late 19th century, rare and valuable books of the Library of Yale College were placed on special shelving at the College Library, now known as Dwight Hall. When the university received a multimillion-dollar bequest from [[John W. Sterling]] for the construction of [[Sterling Memorial Library]] in 1918, the university decided to create a dedicated reading room for its rare books, which became the building's Rare Book Room when the building opened in 1930. Because the bequest did not contain an allowance for books or materials, Yale English professor [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] petitioned Yale alumni to donate materials that would give the university a collection as monumental as its new building.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Merrily E.  |title=The Yale University Library 1701–1978: its History, Collections, and Present Organization |year=1978 |publisher=Yale University Library |location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Sterling opened, Tinker's appeal garnered an impressive collection of rare books, including a [[Gutenberg Bible]] from [[Anna M. Harkness]] and several major collections from the Beinecke family, most notably its collection on the American West.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

By 1958, the library owned more than 130,000 rare volumes and many more manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; The amassed collection proved too large for Sterling's reading room, and the reading room unsuited to their preservation. Having already given significant collections to Yale, Edwin and Frederick Beinecke—as well as Johanna Weigle, widow of their brother Walter—gave funds to build a dedicated rare books library building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Parks |editor-first=Stephen |title=The Beinecke Library of Yale University |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300133981}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Beinecke Library opened on October 14, 1963, it became the home of the volumes from Rare Book Room, and three special collections: the Collection of American Literature, the Collection of Western Americana, and the Collection of German Literature. Shortly afterward, they were joined by the James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection.

Beinecke Library became the repository for books in the Yale collection printed anywhere before 1800, books printed in Latin America before 1751, books printed in North America before 1821, newspapers and broadsides printed in the United States before 1851, European tracts and pamphlets printed before 1801, and Slavic, East European, Near and Middle Eastern books through the eighteenth century, as well as special books outside these categories.

Now, the collection spans through to the present day, including such modern works as limited-edition poetry and [[artists' book]]s. The library also contains thousands of linear feet of archival material, ranging from ancient [[papyri]] and medieval manuscripts to the [[archive|archived personal papers]] of modern writers.

In addition to items on permanent display such as the [[Gutenberg Bible]], the Beinecke offers a year-round program of temporary exhibits drawn from its collections.&lt;ref name=Exhib&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibitions|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brblevents/brblexhibits.html|work=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|publisher=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2006 the library presented ''Breaking the Binding: Printing and the Third Dimension'', a show of flap books, [[pop-up book|pop-ups]], perspective books, panoramas, and peep-shows in printed form.&lt;ref name="Breaking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking the Binding: Printing and the Third Dimension {{!}} Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/breaking-binding-printing-and-third-dimension|website=beinecke.library.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=2017-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Display cases are located on the mezzanine level and at the ground floor entry level, and may be freely viewed by the general public whenever the library is open.

The Library celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/beinecke-50/special-events Special Events | Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]. Beinecke.library.yale.edu. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two full-year exhibitions that explored the library's architecture and people as well as a series of showcases of rarely seen manuscripts, printed works, and visual objects from across all curatorial areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript LIbrary|title=50th Anniversary|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/beinecke-50|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Security measures were significantly increased after the well-known [[antiques dealer]] [[Edward Forbes Smiley III]] was caught cutting maps from rare books with an [[X-acto|X-acto blade]] in 2005. Smiley's scheme was discovered when he dropped his concealed tool in the reading room, and he subsequently served several years in prison for thefts of rare documents valued in millions of dollars from the Beinecke and other libraries.&lt;ref name=Finnegan&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Finnegan |first=William |title=A theft in the library: the case of the missing maps |magazine=The New Yorker|date=October 17, 2005 |pages=64–80 |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2005-10-17#folio=064n2 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |publisher=Conde Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library operates under a [[special collections|closed stack]] system, and rigorous security rules now allow carefully controlled access to materials under [[video surveillance]].&lt;ref name=Rules&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Room Rules|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brbleduc/ReadingRmRules.pdf|work=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|publisher=Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an infestation of the [[death watch beetle]] was discovered in 1977, the Beinecke Library helped pioneer the non-toxic method of controlling paper-eating pests by freezing books and documents at {{convert|-33|°F|°C}} for three days. All new acquisitions are given this treatment as a precaution, and the deep freeze method is now widely accepted for pest control in special collections libraries.&lt;ref name="Kopley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tidmarsh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heymann |first=C.

'''Betty Jo Niccoli'''&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; (born October 9, 1943) is an American former female [[professional wrestler]]. She wrestled in the United States, Canada, and Japan. She was also influential in helping lift the ban of [[Women's professional wrestling|women's wrestling]] in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Professional wrestling career==
Niccoli first saw a professional wrestling match at the age of 15 in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] in 1958, when promoter [[Gust Karras]] suggested she might one day make a good female professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Several years later in 1963, Karras arranged for her to start training.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Her first match was a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in [[Sedalia, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

She wrestled in a series of matches with and against [[Kay Noble]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/04/30/1558296.html|title=Colleagues share Kay Noble stories|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|date=April 30, 2006|accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1970, Niccoli was awarded the [[NWA United States Women's Championship]], but she vacated it later that year, and the title remained inactive until December 1974.&lt;ref name=uswc/&gt; She teamed with [[Paul Peller]] in February 1971 for a series of mixed tag team matches against [[Jean Antone]] and [[Gil Hayes]]. Three years after holding the US Championship, in August 1973, she won the [[AWA World Women's Championship]] from [[Vivian Vachon]] in Canada. She held the title in November 1984, when [[Candi Devine]] defeated her for it. While still holding the AWA title, she spent three months in Japan in 1974,&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; during which time she held [[All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling]]'s [[WWWA World Tag Team Championship]] four times with partner [[Sandy Parker]]. Back in the United States, she helped lift the ban on [[women's amateur wrestling|women's wrestling]] by the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] in the state of New York.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Niccoli, however, never got a chance to wrestle in the state herself.&lt;ref name=slamcac/&gt;

After retiring in 1976, Niccoli stayed out of the wrestling world until she visited a [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] (CAC) reunion in 2007.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; The following year, she was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] in the "Lady Wrestler" category.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; She was also honored by the CAC in 2008.

==Personal life==
In the early 1970s, Niccoli met male professional wrestler [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]], who was ten years her junior, during a mixed tag team match in [[Bob Geigel]]'s promotion in the Central United States.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; The two married a year later, and in 1976, she retired from wrestling.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; The couple had two daughters, both of whom Niccoli stayed at home to raise.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; After her children were old enough to move out of the house, Niccoli began working at the Argosy Casino.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

A '''Certificate of Freedom''' was a government issued document given to a [[convict]] in one of the [[Australia]]n [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at the end of the convict's sentence. This stated that the ex-convict had been restored "to all the rights and privileges of free [[British subject|subjects]]", effectively now a free person, and could seek out [[employment]] or leave the colony.

Certificates of Freedom were introduced in 1810 and were generally granted to convicts, upon application to the Governor, who had served their 7, 10, or 14-year sentence.&lt;ref name="State Archives"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/indexes-online/indexes-to-convict-records/index-to-certificates-of-freedom | title=Index to Certificates of Freedom | publisher=NSW Government | accessdate=23 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101651/https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/indexes-online/indexes-to-convict-records/index-to-certificates-of-freedom | archivedate=24 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts who had received a life sentence could receive a [[pardon]] but not a Certificate of Freedom.

There were three classifications given to convicts who were to be given greater freedoms. The first level was the [[ticket of leave]], which still imposed significant restriction upon the individual and could be issued after at least half the original sentence was served. After the entire original sentence was served a 'certificate of freedom' could be issued no remaining restrictions upon the individual. A third category was a conditional [[pardon]] or full pardon, which were issued to prisoners who had received a life sentence.

The information contained on the certificate usually noted the date, person's name, aliases (if any), ship on which they were transported, year of arrival, when tried and their sentence in years. Certificates from 1827 to 1867 also gave native place, calling, year of birth, physical description and sometimes ticket of leave information.

Certificates comprised two components,. The certificate proper&lt;ref name="Certificate of Freedom"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/convicts/images/4_8084_Certificate_of_freedom.JPG/image_view_fullscreen | title=Certificate of Freedom | publisher=NSW State Library | accessdate=24 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224200212/https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/convicts/images/4_8084_Certificate_of_freedom.JPG/image_view_fullscreen | archivedate=24 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued to the person named and it was mandatory for the person to carry that document with them at all times. The second component was the 'butt';&lt;ref name="Certificate Butt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/convicts/images/certificate-of-freedom-examples/4-4391%20C%20of%20F%20No%2044-801.jpg/image_view_fullscreen | title=Certificate Butt | publisher=NSW State Records Office | accessdate=24 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224193419/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/convicts/images/certificate-of-freedom-examples/4-4391%20C%20of%20F%20No%2044-801.jpg/image_view_fullscreen | archivedate=24 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the official copy and was kept on file by the government. The certificates proper are quite rare as they were in constant use by the owner. The 'butts' are still retained in archive records and are available for researchers.

A variation on the Certificate of Freedom was the Colonial Certificate of Freedom, which related to sentences received for offenses committed after arrival in the colony.&lt;ref name="Colonial Certificate of Freedom"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Australia_Convict_Records | title=Colonial Certificate of Freedom | publisher=church of Latter Day Saints | accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were approximately 40,000 Certificates of Freedom issued by the Colony of New South Wales. [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]] also received convicts and issued Certificates of Freedom.

==Policies==
{{Populism sidebar}}
Several [[List of political parties in Venezuela|political parties in Venezuela]] support ''Chavismo''. The main party, founded by Chávez, is the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] ({{lang-es|Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela|links=no}}), usually referred to by the four letters PSUV). Other parties and movements supporting ''Chavismo'' include [[Fatherland for All]] (Spanish: ''Patria Para Todos'' or PPT) and ''[[Tupamaro (Venezuela)|Tupamaros]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Broadly, ''Chavismo'' policies include [[nationalization]], [[Welfare|social welfare programs]] and [[Neoliberalism#Criticism|opposition to neoliberalism]] (particularly the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]).

In January 2007, Chávez proposed to build the communal state, whose main idea is to build self-government institutions like [[Venezuelan Communal Councils|communal councils]], [[Commune (model of government)|communes]] and communal cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azzellini|first=Dario|title=The Communal State: Communal Councils, Communes, and Workplace Democracy|url=https://nacla.org/article/communal-state-communal-councils-communes-and-workplace-democracy|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist John Magdaleno, the number of Venezuelans who define themselves as ''Chavistas'' has declined since the [[death of Hugo Chávez]] and the deterioration of the [[Economic policy of the Nicolás Maduro administration|economy during Nicolás Maduro's tenure]] from 44% in October 2012 to around 22% in December 2014.&lt;ref name=ENmarzo3&gt;{{cite news|title=AFP: Gobierno de Maduro empeoró inflación, devaluación y pobreza que dejó Chávez|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/politica/AFP-Gobierno-Maduro-devaluacion-Chavez_0_584941529.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|agency=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, a poll conducted by International Consulting Services, an organization created by Dr. Juan Vicente Scorza, a sociologist and anthropologist for the [[National Experimental University of the Armed Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Victor|title=Dr. Juan Scorza, docente de la Unefa, realizará charla: "16 Tipos de Personalidades", en la "Jornada de Salud"|url=http://www.unefa.edu.ve/caracas/noticias.php?r2t1rg4=v1rn4v2r1s&amp;Gftund=MTM0OA==&amp;r1ng4s=n4v2r1s|publisher=National Experimental University of the Armed Forces|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 62% of Venezuelans consider themselves supporters or followers of the ideals of Chávez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icslatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Encuesta-ICS-febrero-2015.pdf|title=Sondeos de opinión VENEZUELA - Encuesta ICS Febrero 2015|publisher=International Consulting Services|date=24 February 2015|accessdate=6 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140144/http://www.icslatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Encuesta-ICS-febrero-2015.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, many ''Chavistas'' became disenchanted with the Bolivarian government and sought to emigrate from [[Venezuela]] to a more stable country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woody|first=Christopher|title='The tipping point': More and more Venezuelans are uprooting their lives to escape their country's crises|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/venezuela-migration-economic-political-crisis-2016-11|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Despite its claim to socialist rhetoric, ''Chavismo'' has been frequently described as being [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|title=The Rise Of State-Controlled Capitalism|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126835124|accessdate=8 October 2018|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview, after being asked if he would take Venezuela's failing economy as an admission that socialism "wrecked people's lives", philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] said: "I never described Chavez's state capitalist government as 'socialist' or even hinted at such an absurdity. It was quite remote from socialism. Private capitalism remained ... Capitalists were free to undermine the economy in all sorts of ways, like massive export of capital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Stossel|first=John|title=Noam Chomsky's Venezuela Lesson|url=https://reason.com/archives/2017/05/31/noam-chomskys-venezuela-lesson|accessdate=8 October 2018|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also frequently point towards Venezuela's large private sector. In 2009, roughly 70% of Venezuela's [[gross domestic product]] was created by the private sector. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=What socialism?

==Academic views on ''Chavismo''==
Academic research produced about ''Chavismo'' shows a considerable consensus when acknowledging its early shift to the left and its strong populist component. However, besides these two points there is significant disagreement in the literature. According to Kirk A. Hawkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Kirk A.|date=2016|title=Chavismo, Liberal Democracy, and Radical Democracy|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-072314-113326|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars are generally divided into two camps: a [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] one that sees ''Chavismo'' as an instance of [[democratic backsliding]] and a [[Radical democracy|radical democratic]] one that upholds ''Chavismo'' as the fulfillment of its aspirations for participatory democracy. Hawkins argues that the most important division between these two groups is neither methodological nor theoretical, but ideological. It is a division over basic normative views of democracy: [[liberalism]] versus [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] (page 312).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Liberal democracy approach===
Scholars in this camp adhered to a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideology that valued procedural democracy ([[Multi-party system|competitive elections]], [[Voter turnout|widespread participation]] defined primarily in terms of voting and [[civil liberties]]) as the political means best suited to achieving human welfare. Many of these scholars had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal vision of economics]], although some were [[moderate]] [[Social democracy|social democrats]] who were critical of [[neoliberalism]]. Together, they saw ''Chavismo'' in a mostly negative light as a case of democratic backsliding or even competitive [[authoritarianism]] or electoral authoritarian regime. The most relevant aspects of the liberal critique of ''Chavismo'' are the following:
#Failure to ensure free and fair elections due to fraud or frequent changes of electoral rules. The government also violates principles of electoral freedom, especially during and after the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|2004 presidential recall election]]. Many of these violations would be possible due to bias within the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (page 314).
#Violation of civil liberties. A number of civil liberties saw significant reverses under the Chávez government, including the [[right of association]] and [[freedom of expression]]. Some of the most significant setbacks are in [[media freedom]], where Chavism has used several means to constrain the operation of commercial media (page 315).
#Infringement of separation of powers. Liberal scholars argue that ''Chavismo'' eliminates the [[separation of powers]] between the branches of government by manipulating to produce a supermajority to the [[supreme court]]. Besides, by 2006, the government had fired hundreds of judges in lower courts as well and threatened to remove and prosecute any judge who dared to rule against the government (page 316).
#Political discrimination and exclusion of opposition parties. Under ''Chavista'' governments, state resources are used to favor the incumbent, the opposition parties lack access to media, and legal institutions are captured by the incumbent. Besides, many sources cited by liberal scholars suggest that the government's participatory initiatives are used as campaign infrastructure (page 316).
#Undermining the rule of law. Liberal critics present three majors examples to sustain that: (i) the politicization of the judiciary and the bureaucracy violated due process and facilitated the growth of corruption; (ii) the state's willingness to intervene in and expropriate private industry, often through dubious legal means, served to weaken property rights; (iii) and levels of violent crime skyrocketed (page 316).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Radical democracy approach===
Scholars in this camp generally adhered to a classical socialist ideology that mistrusted market institutions in either the state or the economy. They saw procedural democracy as insufficient to ensure political inclusion (although they still accepted the importance of liberal democratic institutions) and emphasized participatory forms of democracy and collective worker ownership in the economy. They tended toward descriptions of the movement that celebrated its participatory features or analyzed its potential weaknesses for accomplishing its revolutionary goals. Most of these scholars supported ''Chavismo'' and helped constitute the civilian wing of the movement. Radical scholars argue that democracy can only become effective if it is deepened—and they feel that ''Chavismo'' is doing this deepening, which requires not only the greater inclusion of poor and excluded sectors in decision making but their remaking into a new "popular" identity that facilitates their autonomy and dignity. For some of these scholars, deepening also means the adoption of a socialist economy and some argue it requires taking power through charismatic leadership, which would have enough political support to conduct structural reforms (pages 313–319).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==''Chavismo'' and the media==
In ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' in 2005, [[Thor Halvorssen Mendoza]] described the core of ''Chavismo'' as a "far-reaching foreign policy that aims to establish a loosely aligned federation of revolutionary republics as a resistance bloc in the Americas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/903jhsjt.asp?page=1|title=Hurricane Hugo|last=Halvorssen|first=Thor|authorlink=Thor Halvorssen Mendoza|date=9 August 2005|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Noam Chomsky]] expressed a certain degree of support for Chávez and his policies, saying that he was "quite interested" by his policies and that he regarded "many of them" as "quite constructive", noting that most importantly Chávez seemed to enjoy overwhelming support from his people after "six closely supervised elections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santora|first=Marc|title=Chomsky is Alive, Actually, and Hungry for Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/nyregion/22chomsky.html|accessdate=16 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''[[The New York Sun]]'', ''Chavismo'' was rejected in elections around 2006 in Peru, Colombia and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barone|first=Michael|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/36971?page_no=2|title=Good News|date=31 July 2006|work=[[The New York Sun]]|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'' reported that former [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] kept distance from ''Chavismo'', saying that Brazil is not Venezuela and has traditional institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/08/22/en_pol_art_22A769509.shtml|title=Lula says he is not like Chávez|date=22 August 2006|newspaper=[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]|accessdate=21 December 2007|language=Spanish}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221154459/http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/08/22/en_pol_art_22A769509.shtml|date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Lula supported Chávez in the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2012|Venezuelan presidential election of 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|title=Why Chávez Was Re-elected|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/opinion/why-chavez-was-re-elected.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also supported [[Nicolás Maduro]] in [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2013|Venezuelan presidential election of 2013]] and led his own [[Lulism|political ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Tamara|title=Ex Brazilian President Lula Supports Venezuela's Maduro|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/8476|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=[[Venezuelanalysis]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nation]]'' noted on its editorial pages the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Chavismo'' is not an adequate description of the social movement that makes up Chávez's political base, since many organizations predate his rise to political power, and their leaders and cadre have a sophisticated understanding of their relationship with Chávez. Over the last couple of years, a number of social scientists have done field work in urban ''barrios'', and their findings confirm that this synergy between the central government and participatory local organizations has expanded, not restricted, debate and that democracy is thriving in Venezuela.

''Chavismo'' has ripped open the straitjacket of post–Cold War Latin American discourse, particularly the taboo against government regulation of the economy and economic redistribution. Public policy, including economic policy, is now open to discussion and, importantly, popular influence. This is in sharp contrast to Costa Rica, where a few months ago its Supreme Court, with the support of its executive branch, prohibited public universities from not just opposing but even debating the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which soon won a national referendum by a razor-thin margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Grandin|date=6 December 2007|title=Chavismo and Democracy|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/chavismo-and-democracy/|work=[[The Nation]]|issue=24 December 2007|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014, about a year following Hugo Chávez's death, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hugo Chávez based his popularity on his extraordinary charisma, lots of discretionary money, and a key and well-tested political message: denouncing the past and promising a better future for all. The country's widespread student protests now symbolize the demise of this message. Venezuelans younger than 30 years of age (the majority of the population) have not known any government other than that of Chávez or Maduro. For them, "''Chavismo''" is the past. As for the promises of a better future: The results are in. The catastrophic consequences of Chávez's 21st-century socialism are impossible to mask any longer and the government has run out of excuses. Blaming the CIA, the "fascist opposition", or "dark international forces", as Maduro and his allies customarily do, has become fodder for parodies flooding YouTube. The concrete effects of 15 years of ''Chavismo'' are all too visible in empty shelves and overflowing morgues.&lt;ref name=ATLfeb2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Naím|first1=Moisés|title=The Tragedy of Venezuela|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/the-tragedy-of-venezuela/284062/|accessdate=16 June 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, when ''[[The Economist]]'' was commenting about corruption in Latin America, it said the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;The viceroys of the colonial era set the pattern. They centralised power and bought the loyalty of local interest groups. [...] ''Caudillos'', dictators and elected presidents continued the tradition of personalising power. Venezuela's ''Chavismo'' and the ''Kirchnerismo'' of Ms Fernández are among today's manifestations.&lt;ref name=FPrescue&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy to the rescue?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21646272-despite-epidemic-scandal-region-making-progress-against-plague-democracy|accessdate=14 July 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Codex of Munich''' (or Munich Codex) is a part of the oldest known Hungarian translation of the Bible, called Bible of Hussittes (or the Hussite Bible). It was written at Tatros (today [[Târgu Trotuș]], Romania) in 1466. Today it is located in [[Munich]] at [[Bavarian State Library]]. (Cod. Hung. 1)

==Content==
Codex of Munich contains the Hungarian translation of the four [[Gospel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. At the [[recto and verso|recto]] of the 108th letter, at the end of [[Gospel of John]], there is written who made the copy, where and when it was produced. As it is written, script was finished by György Németi, Son of Imre Henzsel. There is no  further mention about him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25113">This is a conversion chart showing how the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress Classification systems organize resources by concept, in part for the purpose of assigning [[Wiktionary:call number|call numbers]].  These two systems account for over 95% of the classification in [[United States]] libraries, and are used widely around the world.

The chart includes all ninety-nine second level (two-digit) DDC classes (040 is not assigned), and should include all second level (two-digit) LCC classes. Where a class in one system maps to several classes in other system, it will be listed multiple times (e.g. DDC class 551).

'''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]''' and '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''', although closely related [[sister language]]s, differ in many details of their phonology, grammar, and lexicon. Both are part of a broader group known as [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance]], which also includes several other languages or dialects with fewer speakers, all of which are mutually intelligible to some degree.

The most obvious differences are in pronunciation. Mutual intelligibility is generally greater for the written languages than for their spoken forms. Compare, for example, the following sentences:
:''Al buen entendedor pocas palabras bastan'' (Spanish: {{IPA|[al ˈβ̞we̞n e̞nte̞nde̞ˈð̞o̞r ˈpo̞kas paˈlaβ̞ɾaz ˈβ̞astan]}})
:''Ao bom entendedor poucas palavras bastam'' (European Portuguese: {{IPA|[ɜw ˈβõ̞(ɰ̃) ẽ̞tẽ̞dʊ̜̆ˈðoɾ ˈpo(w)kə̻̆ɕ pə̆ˈlavɾə̆ʑ ˈβaɕtə̃w]}}, Brazilian Portuguese: {{IPA|[ɐw ˈbõ̞(w̃) ĩtẽ̞de̞ˈdox ˈpo(w)kə̻̆s pɐˈlavɾə̆z ˈbaɕtə̃w]}})
—roughly equivalent to the English proverb "A word to the wise is sufficient," or, a more literal translation, "To a good listener, a few words are enough."

There are also some significant differences between [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]] as there are between [[American and British English differences|British and American English]] or [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]] and [[Latin American Spanish]]. This article notes these differences below only where: 
* both Brazilian and European Portuguese differ not only from each other, but from Spanish as well;
* both Peninsular (i.e. European) and Latin American Spanish differ not only from each other, but also from Portuguese; or
* either Brazilian or European Portuguese differs from Spanish with [[syntax]] not possible in Spanish (while the other dialect does not).
{{IPA notice}}

==Sample texts==
Portuguese and Spanish share a great number of words that are spelled either identically or almost identically (although the pronunciation almost always differs), or which differ sometimes in predictable ways. Consider, for example, the following paragraph, taken from the {{lang|es|Gramática esencial del español}}, by [[Manuel Seco]] (Espasa Calpe, 1989), and compare it to the Portuguese rendition below, noting the lexical similarity and the slight changes in word order:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Pero, a pesar de esta variedad de posibilidades que la voz posee, sería un muy pobre instrumento de comunicación si no contara más que con ella. La capacidad de expresión del hombre no dispondría de más medios que la de los animales. La voz, sola, es para el hombre escasamente una materia informe, que para convertirse en un instrumento perfecto de comunicación debe ser sometida a un cierto tratamiento. Esa manipulación que recibe la voz son las "articulaciones".''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Mas, apesar da variedade de possibilidades que a voz possui, seria um instrumento de comunicação muito pobre se não se contasse com mais do que ela. A capacidade de expressão do homem não disporia de mais meios que a dos animais. A voz, sozinha, é para o homem apenas uma matéria informe, que para se converter num instrumento perfeito de comunicação deve ser submetida a um certo tratamento. Essa manipulação que a voz recebe são as "articulações".''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vocabulary==

===Cognates===
Most of the frequent words in the two languages share a common origin in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Approximately 90% on standard [[Swadesh lists]].&lt;/ref&gt; but several of these [[cognates]] differ, to a greater or lesser extent, in meaning.

====Two forms vs. one form====
Some words have two forms in one language, but just one in the other: 
* Portuguese ''criar'' corresponds to both Spanish ''crear'' 'to create' and ''criar'' 'to raise'. 
* Spanish ''sueño'' (which means 'dream' and also is used to say that one is sleepy) corresponds to both Portuguese ''sonho'' 'dream' and ''sono'' 'sleep' (the former from Latin {{sm|somnium}} and the latter from {{sm|somnus}}, which produced the same outcome in Spanish).

====False friends====
Some pairs of cognates differ in that they have a broader or narrower meaning in one language than in the other, or their meanings are entirely different. On this basis they are termed "[[false friends]]":

====Semantic change====
Many pairs of cognates have come to have different meanings due to [[semantic change]]. These false friends include the following: 
* Spanish ''diseñar'' means 'to design' in Spanish, while its Portuguese cognate ''desenhar'' means 'to draw'. 
* Similarly, ''dibujo'' is Spanish for 'drawing', but ''debuxo'' means 'sketch' in Portuguese (although it is rather rare and bookish, having been largely displaced by ''rascunho''; cf. Spanish ''rasguño'', which means 'scratch').
* Spanish ''largo'' (also archaic ''luengo'') means 'long', while ''ancho'' means 'wide'. In Portuguese ''largo'' (also ''ancho'') is 'wide' and ''longo'' (a cognate of the Sp. archaic "luengo") is 'long'.
* Spanish ''extrañar'' can mean 'to find strange' or 'to miss'. Portuguese ''estranhar'' means 'to find strange', or ''to lock horns''.
* Spanish ''raro'' can mean 'rare' or 'strange'. In Portuguese, it just means 'rare'.
* Spanish ''aún'' can mean 'yet/still' and ''todavía'' can mean both 'yet/still' or 'however/nevertheless'. Portuguese ''todavia'' means 'however/nevertheless'. In Portuguese, 'yet/still' is ''ainda''.
* Spanish ''(estar) embarazada'' means '(to be) pregnant'. Portuguese ''(estar) embaraçada'' means '(to be) embarrassed' or '(to be) entangled'.&lt;ref&gt;Curiously, the Portuguese term is the origin of both the Spanish and, via French, the English term, according to [[Encarta#Encarta Dictionary|Microsoft Encarta Dictionary]], 2004. It is formed of ''em'' ('in', as a [[prefix]]), ''baraço'' (an old term for 'rope') and [[suffix]] ''-ada'' (which is the feminine form of a verbal ending equivalent to "-ed"), according to its entry in [[Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa|Houaiss Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spanish does have the term ''embarazoso/a'' meaning 'embarrassing'. 'Pregnant' in Portuguese is ''grávida''. The Portuguese ''prenha'' and Spanish ''preñada'' are used mainly for pregnant animals but rarely for women, in both languages
* Spanish ''exquisito'' means 'exquisite/sophisticated'. Portuguese ''esquisito'' means 'strange/weird'.
* ''Experto'' means 'expert' in both Spanish and Portuguese, but in Portuguese it should not be confused with its [[homophone]] ''esperto'' (a homophone only in [[Brazil]]), which means 'smart/intelligent'. 'Expert' in Portuguese may also be ''perito'', ''especialista'', or ''exímio'', which are the same in Spanish (Sp. ''eximio'' is spelled without the accent mark).
* Spanish ''escoba'' is 'broom'. Portuguese ''escova'' is 'brush' or 'broom' (but Portuguese usually chooses 'vassoura' for 'broom'). However, in some varieties of Spanish, ''escobilla'' or ''escobeta'' means 'toilet brush'.
* Spanish ''apellido'' '[[surname]]' is ''apelido'' in European Portuguese, and ''sobrenome'' in both Brazilian and European Portuguese (but Portuguese usually say ''apelido''). Spanish ''sobrenombre''/''apodo'' '[[nickname]]' is ''apelido/alcunha/codinome'' in Brazilian Portuguese, and ''alcunha'' in European Portuguese.
* Spanish ''rojo'' is 'red'. Portuguese ''roxo'' is 'purple'. 'Red' in Portuguese is ''vermelho''. In European Portuguese the word ''encarnado'' (literally ''in the flesh'') is also used as synonym of 'red' even though ''vermelho'' is more frequent.
* Spanish ''rubio'' means 'blond hair'. Portuguese ''ruivo'' means 'red hair'.
* Spanish ''apenas'' means 'hardly'. Portuguese ''apenas'' is 'only'. Thus the Spanish phrase ''él apenas pudo dormir'' means 'he could not even/hardly sleep', or 'he was just barely able to sleep', whereas the Portuguese phrase ''ele pôde apenas dormir'' means 'he could only sleep'.
* Spanish ''vaso'' means 'drinking glass (tumbler)', while Portuguese ''vaso'' means ''toilet'' (from ''vaso sanitário'', ''váter'' in Spanish) or ''flower pot''. A 'drinking glass' in Portuguese is ''copo'', while Spanish ''copa'' is a wine glass. A wine glass in Portuguese is ''copo'' or ''taça'', while Spanish ''taza'' is a 'coffee cup or teacup'; Spanish ''taza'' also refers to the bathroom bowl. 'Coffee cup' in Portuguese is ''xícara de café''/''chávena''.
* Spanish (and European Portuguese) ''cachorro'' means [[puppy]], while in Brazilian Portuguese, it can refer to a dog of any age.

====Frequent function words====
A number of the frequent "[[function words]]" ([[pronouns]], [[conjunctions]], etc.) are cognates in the two languages but are used in slightly different ways, including the following:

=====Spanish ''todo'', Portuguese ''tudo''=====
The Spanish pronoun ''todo'' can mean 'all/every', or 'everything'. Portuguese distinguishes between ''todo'' 'all/every' (masculine) and ''tudo'' 'everything' (neuter, used for an indefinite object or abstraction).

:'''''Todos''' los insectos tienen seis patas.'' (Spanish)
:'''''Todos''' os insetos têm seis patas.'' (Portuguese)
:''''All''' insects have six legs.'

:''El ladrón lo robó '''todo'''.'' (Spanish)
:''O ladrão roubou '''tudo'''.'' (Portuguese)
:'The thief stole '''everything'''' or 'The thief stole '''it all'''.'

=====Relative and interrogative pronouns=====
Spanish uses an [[acute accent]] on [[interrogative pronoun]]s, while the corresponding [[relative pronoun]]s (etymologically the same words) are spelled without the accent to mark the difference in [[prosodic stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 2010, p. 135; Veciana 2004, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; (As explained below, the acute accent often changes the vowel sound in Portuguese, but not Spanish.) For example, ''¿quién?'' (who?) and ''quien'' (who) in Spanish, but ''quem'' for both in Portuguese. Apart from that, while ''"quem"'' is invariable, Spanish has both the singular ''"quién"'' and the plural ''"quiénes."''. As shown by the examples below, the difference between singular and plural is highligted by the use of "é" for singular and "são" for plural:


Example 1:
: ¿Quién es ese hombre? (Spanish)
: ''Quem é esse homem?'' (Portuguese)
: 'Who's that man?' (English - "who" is invariable)

: ¿Quién'''es''' son esas personas? (Spanish)
: ''Quem são essas pessoas?'' (Portuguese)
: 'Who are those people?' (English - again, "who" is invariable)
In the Portuguese examples, the "m" at the end of "quem" is an approximant. It is also a marker for nasalization, as is the nasal diphthong "ão" in "são").

=====Spanish ''muy'' and ''mucho'', Portuguese ''muito''=====
Spanish distinguishes the adjective ''mucho'' 'much/many' from the adverb ''muy'' 'very/quite'. Portuguese uses ''muito'' for both (there's also ''mui'', but it is considered old-fashioned)

: ''Saqué '''muchas''' fotos durante el viaje.'' (Spanish)
: ''Tirei '''muitas''' fotos durante a viagem.'' (Portuguese)
: 'I took '''many''' photos during the trip.'

: ''Las cerezas están '''muy''' maduras.'' (Spanish)
: ''As cerejas estão '''muito''' maduras.'' (Portuguese)
: 'The cherries are '''quite''' ripe.'

As an adjective, ''muito'' is [[inflection|inflected]] according to the gender and number of the noun it qualifies, like ''mucho''. As an adverb, it is invariable like ''muy''. Thus, it would be incorrect to say *''muitas maduras'' in the second example.

=====Cardinal numbers=====
The cardinal numbers are very similar in Spanish and Portuguese, but there are differences of usage in numbers one and two. Spanish has different words for the masculine singular indefinite article ('a, an') and the numeral 'one', thus ''un capítulo'' 'a chapter', but ''capítulo uno'' 'chapter one'. In Portuguese, both words are the same: ''um capítulo'' and ''capítulo um''. Spanish ''uno'' can also be used as a pronoun, like the English [[one (pronoun)|generic "one"]], to represent an indeterminate subject, but this is not possible with Portuguese ''um''; the reflexive pronoun ''se'' is used instead. ''Se'' may be used in Spanish to form passive and impersonal constructions, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Butt |first= John |author2=Carmen Benjamin |title= A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill Education]] |location= [[New York City]] |year= 2000 |edition=3rd|isbn= 0-658-00873-0 |page=394 (§28.6) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''''Uno''' (''or'' '''Se''') debe pensar antes de actuar.'' (Spanish)
:''Deve-'''se''' pensar antes de agir.'' (Portuguese)
:''''One''' should think before acting.'

This still applies in cases where a relatively indeterminate subject is genderized, such as the Spanish ''todos a una [voz]'' ('all at once', literally 'all at one [voice]'). It should be rewritten in Portuguese without any cardinal number. For example, ''todos juntos'' 'all together'.

On the other hand, in Portuguese, cardinal number 'two' inflects with gender (''dois'' if masculine, ''duas'' if feminine), while in Spanish ''dos'' is used for both.

:''Uno más uno es igual a '''dos'''.'' (Spanish)
:''Um mais um é igual a '''dois'''.'' (Portuguese)
:'One plus one equals '''two'''.'

:'''''Dos''' cabezas piensan mejor que una.'' (Spanish)
:'''''Duas''' cabeças pensam melhor que uma.'' (Portuguese)
:''''Two''' heads think better than one.'

:''Tengo '''dos''' hermanos y '''dos''' hermanas.'' (Spanish)
:''Tenho '''dois''' irmãos e '''duas''' irmãs.'' (Portuguese)
:'I have '''two''' brothers and '''two''' sisters.'

=====Conjunctions=====
The conjunction "and" in Spanish is ''y'' (pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} before a consonant, {{IPA|[j]}} before a vowel) before all words except those beginning with an {{IPA|[i]}} sound (spelled ''i''- or ''hi''-). Before a syllabic {{IPA|[i]}} sound (and '''''not''''' the diphthong {{IPA|[je]}} as in ''hierro''), the Spanish conjunction is ''e'' {{IPA|[e̞]}}. Portuguese uses ''e'' {{IPA|[i]}} before all words.

:''Sal '''y''' pimienta.'' (Spanish)
:''Sal '''e''' pimenta.'' (Portuguese)
:'Salt '''and''' pepper.'

:''Judío '''e''' hindú.'' (Spanish)
:''Judeu '''e''' hindu.'' (Portuguese)
:'Jewish '''and''' Hindu.'

:''Leones '''y''' hienas.'' (Spanish)
:''Leões '''e''' hienas.'' (Portuguese)
:'Lions '''and''' hyenas.'

Similarly, for the conjunction "or" Spanish uses ''o'' {{IPA|[o̞]}} before all words except those beginning with ''o''- or ''ho''-, in which case it uses ''u'' {{IPA|[w]}}. Portuguese always uses ''ou'' {{IPA|[ow]}}~{{IPA|[o]}}.

:''Vino '''o''' agua.'' (Spanish)
:''Vinho '''ou''' água.'' (Portuguese)
:'Wine '''or''' water.'

:''Uno '''u''' otro.'' (Spanish)
:''Um '''ou''' outro.'' (Portuguese)
:'One '''or''' the other.'

=====''Se'', ''si'', ''sí'', and ''sim''=====
In Portuguese, the word ''se'' can be a reflexive pronoun or a conjunction meaning 'if'. This may give the '''''false''''' impression that a Portuguese verb '''''is''''' [[Reflexive verb|pronominal]] when it is '''''not'''''. For example, ''Se ficou em Paris...'' means 'If one stayed in Paris...' When the conjunction ''se'' precedes a pronominal verb, it is common to have a double ''se'' in the sentence, such as ''Se se esqueceu da sua senha...'' 'If you forgot your password...'

=====Indirect object pronouns=====
Spanish ''le'' and ''les'' are changed to ''se'' when followed by ''lo'', ''la'', ''los'', or ''las''. For example, "Mi abuelo '''les''' compró los regalos" becomes "Mi abuelo '''se''' los compró". See also [[Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish#Combining pronouns in Spanish|"Combining pronouns in Spanish"]] below. In addition, Spanish uses ''sé'' as an irregular verb in the first person singular indicative of ''saber'' (to know), and the second person singular imperative of ''ser'' (to be). In Portuguese, these are ''sei'' and ''sê'' respectively.

===Dissimilar words===
Despite the mostly cognate vocabulary between Spanish and Portuguese, a significant number of common words are entirely different in the two languages (although in some cases cognates exist, but are rare or archaic in one of the two languages). Examples include the following:

Vocabulary differences between the two languages arose from various factors:

====French influence====
Both Portuguese and Spanish have borrowed [[loanwords]] either directly from [[French language|French]] or by way of French as an intermediary from other (mostly Greco-Latin) sources. Although no statistical study based on uniform criteria has been carried out, it has been suggested that words of French origin in Portuguese are significantly more numerous than those in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportuguese.com/blog_traducao/algumas-diferencas-entre-o-espanhol-e-o-portugues/ Blog sobre Português]: "Durante o desenvolvimento dessas línguas na Idade Média e Renascimento, o espanhol manteve-se mais autônomo, enquanto que o português foi mais influenciado por outras línguas europeias, a exemplo do francês" (In the development of the two languages during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Spanish remained more autonomous, while Portuguese was more influenced by other European languages, for example French).&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples:

====Arabic influence====
Spanish kept much of the [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] vocabulary of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, while the Mozarabic component was less extensive in Portuguese. Thus we find a number of cases in which the usual Spanish word is derived from Arabic, while the corresponding word in Portuguese is [[Latin language|Latin]]- or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-derived, as in the following examples:

There are some examples where a word of Arabic origin is used in Portuguese but not in Spanish, such as: Sp. ''romero'', Port. ''alecrim'' (Port. ''rosmaninho'' or ''rosmarinho'' means 'lavender'), 'rosemary'; Sp. ''lechuga'', Port. ''alface'' (in Port. ''leituga'' means 'catsear'), 'lettuce'; Port. ''alfaiate'', Sp. ''sastre'' 'tailor'&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Victor|title=Words: an illustrated history of western languages|publisher=Book Club Associates|date=1983|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more commonly used in Portuguese than in Spanish although the word exists in both languages, such as: ''chafariz'' 'fountain' (Port.''fonte'', Sp. ''fuente'') or ''garrafa'' 'bottle' (Port. ''botelha'', Sp. ''botella'').
In a few cases Spanish and Portuguese have both borrowed different Arabic-derived words for the same meaning, such as: Sp. ''alfombra'', Port. ''alcatifa'', 'carpet'; Sp. ''aduana'', Port. ''alfândega'', 'customs' ; the latter is derived from the name of a town in Portugal that once stood on the boundary between Christendom and Islam.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Arabic is the source of a few personal given names and numerous surnames and place names in Spain, including the following:

====Influences from other languages==== 
Spanish and Portuguese have acquired different words from various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], [[African languages|African]] and Asian languages, as in the following examples:
::* '[[Pineapple#The name|pineapple]]': Sp. ''piña'' (from the Spanish word for 'pine cone') / Port. ''abacaxi'' (from [[Tupian languages|Tupi]]) or ''ananás'' (from [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]]; also in Spanish, by way of Portuguese, ''ananás'' or ''ananá'').
::* '[[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]]': Sp. ''pipa'' (from supposed Late Latin {{sm|pīpa}}) / Port. ''cachimbo'' (from [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cândido Figueiredo, ''Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa'' (Rio de Janeiro: Mérito: 1949); Francisco da Silveira Bueno, ''Grande Dicionário Etimológico-Prosódico da Língua Portuguesa'' (São Paulo: Saraiva, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;
::* '[[Tea#Etymology and cognates in other languages|tea]]': Sp. ''té'' (from [[Min Nan]] Chinese) / Port. ''chá'' (from [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The True History of Tea|first=Erling|last=Hoh|first2=Victor|last2=Mair|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2009|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Days of the week====
Unlike the other [[Romance language]]s, modern Portuguese does not use the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Names of the days of the week|planetary system]] for the days Monday through Friday. Instead, the weekdays are numerical, and derived from [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. The word ''feira'' (from Latin [[Feria|{{sm|fēria}}]]) refers to daily (Roman Catholic) religious celebrations; it is cognate with [[:pt:Feira|''feira'']] 'fair' or 'market', as well as with ''férias'' 'vacation' and ''feriado'' 'holiday'. In Spanish, the days of the week are all masculine; in Portuguese, the ''feira'' days are feminine, while ''sábado'' and ''domingo'' are masculine.

The form ''Terça-feira'' (&lt; Lat. {{sm|tertia fēria}}) differs in its first component from the usual Portuguese word for 'third', ''terceira'' (&lt; Lat. {{sm|tertiāria}}).

In actual usage, the word ''feira'' is often dropped:

:''Vou visitar-te na segunda.'' (European Portuguese)
:''Vou te visitar na segunda.'' (Brazilian and European Portuguese)
:'I'll visit you on Monday.'

==Grammar==
Broadly speaking, the grammars of Portuguese and Spanish share many common features. Nevertheless, some differences between them can present hurdles to people acquainted with one and learning the other.

===Gender===
Spanish has three forms for the singular [[definite article]], ''el'', masculine, ''la'', feminine, and ''lo'', [[grammatical gender|neuter]]. The last is used with adjectives to form abstract nouns employed in a generic sense, and also to intensify the meaning of adjectives. In Portuguese, there is only ''o'', masculine, and ''a'', feminine. Literary Spanish has also three corresponding third person pronouns, ''él'' 'he', ''ella'' 'she', and ''ello'' 'it' (referring to a broad concept, not a named object), while Portuguese has only ''ele'', masculine, and ''ela'', feminine. The Spanish neuters ''lo'' and ''ello'' have no plural forms.

Some words are masculine in Spanish, but feminine in Portuguese, or vice versa. A common example are nouns ended in ''-aje'' in Spanish, which are masculine, and their Portuguese cognates ending in ''-agem'', which are feminine. For example, Spanish ''el viaje'' 'the journey' (masculine, like French ''le voyage'' and Italian ''il viaggio'') corresponds to the Portuguese feminine ''a viagem''. Similarly, ''el puente'' 'bridge', ''el dolor'' 'pain', or ''el árbol'' 'tree' are masculine nouns in Modern Spanish, whereas ''a ponte'', ''a dor'', and ''a árvore'' are feminine in Portuguese. On the other hand, the Spanish feminine ''la leche'' 'the milk' corresponds to Portuguese ''o leite'' (masculine, like French ''le lait'', Italian ''il latte''). Likewise, ''nariz'' 'nose' is feminine in Spanish and masculine in Portuguese.

Some Spanish words can be both masculine and feminine, with different meanings. Both meanings usually exist also in Portuguese, but with one and the same gender, so that they can't be differentiated unless further information is provided. For instance, the word ''orden'' 'order' can mean both 'harmonious arrangement' and 'directive', like its counterparts in English and Portuguese. But the Spanish word is masculine when used with the first meaning, and feminine with the second:

:''Me sorprendió '''el''' orden.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order [i.e., by how orderly it all was].')
:''Me sorprendió '''la''' orden.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order [i.e., by the directive that was given].')

In Portuguese, the equivalent word ''ordem'' is always feminine:

:''Me supreendeu/Surpreendeu-me '''a''' ordem.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order.')
Without additional context, it is impossible to tell which meaning was intended in Portuguese and English (though other words could be substituted; in English, one would likely use ''orderliness'' in the first case above rather than ''order'', which would, by itself, suggest the second case).

===Use of the definite article===
In many varieties of Portuguese, [[personal names]] are normally preceded by a [[definite article]], a trait also found in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. In Portuguese, this is a relatively recent development, which some Brazilian dialects have not adopted yet, most notably in some states of the Brazilian Northeast. In those dialects of Portuguese that do regularly use definite articles before proper nouns, the article may be omitted for extra formality, or to show distance in a literary narrative. Compare, for example, English "Mary left", Spanish ''María salió'', and Portuguese ''A Maria saiu''. Note, however, that in many Spanish dialects the definite article is used before personal names; thus, ''la María salió'' is commonly heard.

Portuguese uses the definite article before the names of some cities and almost all countries except relatively new ones, such as ''Cingapura''/''Singapura'' ('Singapore'), and those related to Portugal (or with which Portugal has historical relationships, even though this is a rough rule) and the Portuguese-speaking countries, e.g., ''a Holanda'' but ''Portugal''; ''o México'' but ''Angola'', ''a Suécia'', but ''Moçambique''. The major exception to the country rule is ''o Brasil''. 
In Spanish, use of the definite article is optional with some countries: ''(la) China'', ''(el) Japón'', ''(la) India'', ''(la) Argentina'', ''(el) Ecuador'', ''(el) Perú'', ''(el) Uruguay'', ''(el) Paraguay'', ''(el) Brasil'', ''(los) Estados Unidos'', etc. The same is true with two continents: ''(la) Antártida'' and ''(el) África''; with archipelagos and islands: ''(las) Filipinas'', ''(las) Canarias'', ''(las) Azores'', with some provinces, regions or territories: ''(el) Tíbet'', ''(la) Toscana'', ''(el) Piamonte'', ''(el) Lacio'' and with some cities: ''(el) Cairo'', ''(la) Valeta''. Spanish uses the definite article with all geographical names when they appear with an adjective or modifying phrase, as in the following examples: ''la España medieval'' 'medieval Spain', ''el Puerto Rico prehispánico'' 'pre-Hispanic Puerto Rico', ''el Portugal de Salazar'' 'Portugal during Salazar's dictatorship', etc.

:''Santiago es la capital de Chile.'' (Spanish)
:''Santiago é a capital d'''o''' Chile.'' (Portuguese)
:'Santiago is the capital of Chile.'

:''Él es de Costa Rica, que está en América Central.'' (Spanish)
:''Ele é d'''a''' Costa Rica, que fica n'''a''' América Central.'' (Portuguese)
:'He is from Costa Rica, which is in Central America.'

:''Tengo un boleto para ('''los''') Estados Unidos de América.'' (Spanish)
:''Tenho um bilhete para '''os''' Estados Unidos d'''a''' América.'' (Portuguese)
:'I have a ticket to '''the''' United States of America.'

:''Nueva Delhi no es la ciudad más poblada de ('''la''') India''. (Spanish)
:''Nova Déli não é a cidade mais populosa d'''a''' Índia''. (Portuguese)
:'New Delhi is not the most populous city in India.'

:'''''La''' Europa medieval pertenecía a monarcas absolutos''. (Spanish)
:'''''A''' Europa medieval pertencia a monarcas absolutos''. (Portuguese)
:'Medieval Europe belonged to absolute monarchs.'

Portuguese omits the definite article in stating the time of day unless ''para as'' is used.

:''Son '''las''' nueve y cuarto'', but also ''Son nueve y quince'' or ''Son nueve quince''. (Spanish)
:''São (as) nove (horas) e quinze (minutos)''. (Portuguese) (parenthesical parts often omitted)
:'It's nine fifteen.' Or:'It's a quarter past/after nine.'
 
In addition, in most dialects of Portuguese the definite article is used before [[possessive adjective]]s (as it is used in [[Italian language|Italian]]), which is not possible in Spanish. For instance, the sentence 'This is my brother' is ''Este es mi hermano'' in Spanish, but may be ''Este é '''''o''''' meu irmão'' in Portuguese. Nevertheless, in many Brazilian dialects (mostly in the Northeast) and in casual Brazilian Portuguese the article is not used in sentences such as: ''Este é meu irmão'' (although it usually reappears in sentences such as "'''''O''''' meu irmão está lá").

===Possessives===
In Portuguese, [[possessive adjective]]s have the same form as [[possessive pronoun]]s, and they all agree with the gender of the possessed item. In Spanish, the same is true of ''nuestro''/''nuestra'' ("our") and ''vuestro''/''vuestra'' ("your" [plural]), but for all other possessives, the pronoun has a longer form that agrees with the gender of the possessed item, while the adjective has a shorter form that does not change for gender. The possessive adjectives are normally preceded by a definite article in Continental Portuguese, less so in Brazilian Portuguese, and never in Spanish. The possessive pronouns are preceded by a definite article in all dialects of both languages. See examples in the table below.

|}

===Pronouns===

====Object pronouns====
In Portuguese, third-person [[clitic]] pronouns have special variants used after certain types of verb endings, which does not happen in Spanish. The default object pronouns ''o''/''a''/''os''/''as'' change to ''lo''/''la''/''los''/''las'' when they follow a verb that ends in ⟨r⟩, ⟨s⟩ or ⟨z⟩, and to ''no''/''na''/''nos''/''nas'' when they follow a verb that ends in a nasal sound.

{|class="wikitable"

|-
|align=left| '''''lo''' mantienen'' ||align=left| ''mantêm-'''no''''' ||align=left| 'they keep it'
|}

In Brazilian Portuguese, these forms are uncommon, since the pronoun normally precedes the verb (i.e., ''você '''o''' mantenha'' in the above example), and third-person subject pronouns are used informally as object pronouns (''mantenha '''ele'''''), which has been proved to be present in the language since Galician-Portuguese times. However, as it has been considered ungrammatical to begin a sentence with an object pronoun, the above examples are, on rare occasion, used in Brazil as well.

====Clitic personal pronouns====
European Portuguese differs from Brazilian Portuguese with regard to the placement of [[clitic]] personal pronouns, and Spanish is in turn different from both of them.

*In Spanish, clitic pronouns normally come before the verb, except with the imperative, the infinitive, and the gerund. In verbal periphrases, they precede the [[auxiliary verb]].
*In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, clitic pronouns normally come before the ''main'' verb. In verbal periphrases, they come between the auxiliary verb and the main verb. This occurs even with the imperative, the infinitive, the gerund, and the past participle.
*In European Portuguese, clitic pronouns may come before or after the verb, depending on the type of [[clause]]. In verbal periphrases, they may precede or follow the auxiliary verb, or follow the main verb (when this is in the infinitive or the gerund).

|}

====Mesoclisis====
In Portuguese, verbs in the future indicative or conditional tense may be split into [[morpheme]]s, and the clitic pronoun can be inserted between them, a feature known as [[mesoclisis]]. This also occurred in [[Old Spanish]], but no comparable phenomenon takes place in modern Spanish:

:'''''Lo''' traerá.'' (Spanish)
:''Trá-'''lo'''-á.'' (European Portuguese and formal written Brazilian Portuguese)
:'He/She will bring '''it'''.'

However, these tenses are often replaced with others in the spoken language. Future indicative is sometimes replaced by present indicative; conditional is very often replaced by imperfect indicative. In colloquial language, most Portuguese would state ''trá-lo-á'' as ''vai trazê-lo'' ('going to bring it') or ''irá trazê-lo'' ('will bring it'). In Brazilian Portuguese, "vai trazer ele" would be the vernacular use.

====Combining pronouns in Spanish====
The Spanish construction, ''se lo dio'', means either '[He/She] gave it to [him/her]' or '[He/She] gave it to ''himself/herself'''. The expected pattern for the former would be *'''''le''' lo dio'', but such a construction does not exist. This is unique to Spanish.

*Latin: {{sm|dedit illī illud}} → {{sm|dedit illī illum}} (early [[Vulgar Latin]]) → {{sm|dit illi illu}} (Late Vulgar Latin)
*Spanish: ''dio (i)lli (el)lo'' → ''dio ge lo'' → ''diógelo'' (arch.) → ''dióselo'' → ''se lo dio''
*Portuguese: ''deu (i)lli (l)o'' → ''deu lhe (l)o'' → ''deu-lho''

Thus, modern Spanish makes no distinction between the [[reflexive pronoun]] ''se'' and the [[dative case|dative]] personal pronoun ''se''. Note that this did not happen in old Spanish: ''dió'''g'''elo'', 'he gave it to him', ''dió'''s'''elo'', 'he gave it to himself'. The medieval ''g'' sound (similar to that of French) was replaced with ''s'' in the 14th-15th centuries (cf. Spanish ''co'''g'''er'', 'to catch', but ''co'''s'''echa'', 'harvest', Port. ''colher'' and ''colheita'', both from Lat. {{sm|colligere}}).

====Use of stressed pronouns for inanimate subjects====
In Spanish, stressed pronouns are never used for inanimate subjects (i.e., things, as opposed to people or animals), not even for clarity or disambiguation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=pronombres%20personales%20tónicos&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese knows no such restriction, so that stressed pronouns referring to inanimate subjects can either be used or dropped:

:''¿Dónde están las llaves? Están en la mesa.'' (Spanish – pronoun is often dropped)
:''Onde estão as chaves? ('''Elas''') estão na mesa.'' (Portuguese – pronoun is optional)
:'Where are the keys? On the table.' (English – pronoun is not necessarily required)

====Second-person pronouns====
The use of second-person pronouns differs dramatically between Spanish and Portuguese, and even more so between European and Brazilian Portuguese. Spanish ''tú'' and ''usted'' correspond etymologically to Portuguese ''tu'' and ''você'', but Portuguese has gained a third, even more formal form ''o(s) senhor(es), a(s) senhora(s)'', demoting ''você'' to an "equalizing" rather than respectful register. The old familiar forms have been largely lost in the Portuguese-speaking world, as the Portuguese equalizing forms ''você'' or ''vocês'' have displaced ''tu'' to a large extent and ''vós'' almost entirely; and even where ''tu'' is still used, the second-person verb forms that historically corresponded to it are often replaced by the same (third-person) forms that are used with "você".

In the plural, Portuguese familiar ''vós'' is archaic nearly everywhere (as with the old English second singular "thou"), and both the subject pronoun and its corresponding second-person plural verb forms are generally limited to the Bible, traditional prayers, and spoken varieties of certain regions of rural Portugal; normally, the familiar (and equalizing) form is now ''vocês,'' although in Portugal the second person plural forms are retained for both object and possessive pronouns (e.g., ''vocês e a vossa família''). In the case of Peninsular Spanish, ''tú'', ''usted'', ''vosotros'', and ''ustedes'' have more or less kept their original functions; if anything, ''tú'' is displacing ''usted'' out of common use and ''usted'' is coming to be used only for formal situations (like ''o senhor'' in Portuguese). Latin American Spanish is more complicated: ''vosotros'' has fallen out of use in favor of ''ustedes'', but certain regions of Spanish America also use ''vos'' as a ''singular'' informal pronoun, displacing ''tú'' out of its original role to a greater or lesser extent (see ''[[voseo]]'').

Spoken Brazilian Portuguese has dramatically simplified the pronoun system, with ''você(s)'' tending to displace all other forms. Although a few parts of Brazil still use ''tu'' and the corresponding second-person singular verb forms, most areas either use ''tu'' with third-person verb forms or (increasingly) drop ''tu'' entirely in favor of ''você''. This has in turn caused the original third-person possessive ''seu, sua'' to shift to primarily second-person use, alongside the appearance of a new third-person possessive ''dele, dela'' (plural ''deles, delas'', "their") that follows the noun (thus paraphrases such as ''o carro dele'' "his car", ''o carro dela'' "her car"). The formal ''o senhor'' is also increasingly restricted to highly formal situations, such as that of a storekeeper addressing a customer, or a child or teenager addressing an adult stranger.

More conservative in this regard is the ''fluminense'' dialect of Brazilian Portuguese (spoken in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Espírito Santo]] and in the [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] of the state of [[Minas Gerais]]) – especially its ''[[carioca]]'' sociolect. This dialect generally preserves intimate or familiar ''tu'', the standard equalizing form ''você'', and the respectful or formal ''o senhor''/''a senhora'', together with their related possessives, to such an extent that almost all speakers use these forms, according to context. Nevertheless, a minority of educated speakers correctly conjugates all of the ''tu'' pronouns formally; otherwise, it is mostly conjugated as ''você''.

Standard Portuguese usage has ''vocês'' and ''os senhores/as senhoras'' as plurals of ''você'' and ''o senhor''/''a senhora'', but the vernacular has also produced new forms with the second-person familiar plural function, such as ''gente'' (compare '''''a''' gente'' as a possible colloquial variation of ''nós'', "we"/"us", that should be conjugated—but commonly is not—as third-person singular), ''pessoas'', ''pessoal'', ''[meu] povo'', ''cês'' ([[eye dialect]] for ''vocês'' in colloquial pronunciation), and ''galera'' (the latter mainly associated with youth slang).

It is often said that the ''gaúcho'', ''nordestino'' and ''amazofonia'' dialects, as well as some sociolects elsewhere, such as that in and around the city of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], have preserved ''tu''; but unlike in ''fluminense'', the use of ''você'' is very limited, and entirely absent among some speakers, and ''tu'' takes its place. In these areas, the verb with ''tu'' is conjugated in the third-person form (as with ''você'') – except among educated speakers in some urban centers such as [[Porto Alegre]] and, especially, [[Belém]]. See [[Brazilian Portuguese]].

===Verbs===

===="To be"====
Spanish and Portuguese have two main [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]s, ''ser'' and ''estar''. For the most part, the use of these verbs is the same in both languages, but there are a few cases where it differs. The main difference between Spanish and Portuguese is in the interpretation of the concept of state versus essence and in the generalizations one way or another that are made in certain constructions. For instance,

:'''''Está''' prohibido fumar.'' (Spanish) [estar]
:'''''É''' proibido fumar.'' (Portuguese) [ser]
:'Smoking '''is''' forbidden.'

:''La silla '''está''' hecha de madera.'' (Spanish) [estar]
:''A cadeira '''é''' feita de madeira.'' (Portuguese) [ser]
:'The chair '''is''' made of wood.'

:''Sólo uno '''es''' correcto.'' (Spanish) [ser]
:''Só um '''está''' correto''. (Portuguese) [estar]
:'Only one '''is''' correct.'

Also, the use of ''ser'' regarding a permanent location is much more accepted in Portuguese. Conversely, ''estar'' is often permanent in Spanish regarding a location, while in Portuguese, it implies being temporary or something within the immediate vicinity (same house, building, etc.)

:''Nuestra oficina '''queda''''' (or '''''está''''') ''muy lejos.'' (Spanish) [quedar/estar]
:''O nosso escritório '''é''''' (or '''''fica''''') ''muito longe.'' (Portuguese) [ser/ficar]
: 'Our office '''is''' very far away.'

:''¿Dónde '''está''''' (or '''''queda''''') ''el aeropuerto?'' (Spanish) [estar/quedar]
:''Onde '''fica''''' (or '''''é''''') ''o aeroporto?'' (Portuguese) [ficar/ser]
:'Where '''is''' the airport?'

Because the airport is obviously not anywhere nearby, ''ficar'' is used in Portuguese (most common), though ''ser'' can also be used.

Secondary copulas are ''quedar(se)'' in Spanish and ''ficar'' in Portuguese. Each can also mean 'to stay' or 'to remain.'

: '''''Me quedé''' dentro de la casa todo el día.'' (Spanish)
: '''''Fiquei''' dentro de casa todo o dia.'' (Portuguese)
: ''''I stayed''' inside the house all day.'

The Spanish sentence using the reflexive form of the verb (''quedarse'') implies that staying inside the house was voluntary, while Portuguese and English are quite ambiguous on this matter without any additional context. (See also the next section.)

Both Spanish ''quedar(se)'' and Portuguese ''ficar'' can mean 'become':

:''Mi abuela '''se está quedando''' sorda.'' (Spanish)
:''A minha avó '''está ficando''' surda.'' (Brazilian Portuguese and some dialects of European Portuguese)
:''A minha avó '''está a ficar''' surda.'' (European Portuguese)
:'My grandmother '''is becoming''' deaf.'

====Reflexive verbs====
[[Reflexive verb]]s are somewhat more frequent in Spanish than in Portuguese, especially with actions relating to parts of the body:

:''Guillermo '''se''' quebró la pierna jugando a la pelota.'' (Spanish)
:''O Guilherme quebrou a perna jogando bola.'' (Brazilian Portuguese)
:''O Guilherme partiu a perna a jogar à bola.'' (European Portuguese)
: 'William broke his leg playing football.'

===="To like"====
The Portuguese and Spanish verbs for expressing "liking" are similar in form (''gostar'' and ''gustar'' respectively) but different in their arrangement of [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]]. Arguments in linguistics are expressions that enable a verb to complete its meaning. Expressions of liking typically require two arguments: (1) a person who likes something (sometimes called the [[Theta role|"experiencer"]]), and (2) something that the person likes (sometimes called the [[Theta role|"theme"]]). Portuguese and Spanish (as well as English) assign different [[grammatical cases]] to these arguments, as shown in the following table:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:800px; height:100px;"
|+ Argument structure with verbs of liking
|-
! 
! Person who likes
! Thing that is liked
! Form
|-
! Portuguese
| Subject || Object of preposition ''de'' || (Eu) gosto da música.
|-
! Spanish
| Indirect object || Subject || Me gusta la música.
|-
! English
| Subject || Direct object || I like the music.
|}

The Portuguese sentence can be translated literally as "[I] [take satisfaction] [from] [the music]", while the Spanish corresponds to "[To me] [(it) is pleasing] [the music]."

It is also possible in Spanish to express it as: "(Yo) gusto de la música", although this use has become antiquated.

====Auxiliary verb of the perfect====
In Spanish, the compound [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] is constructed with the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' (&lt; Latin {{sm|habēre}}). Although Portuguese used to use its cognate verb (''haver'') in this way, now it is more common to form these tenses with ''ter'' ('to have') (&lt; Latin {{sm|tenēre}}). While ''ter'' is occasionally used as an auxiliary by other Iberian languages, it is much more pervasive in Portuguese. Note that most Portuguese verb tables only contain ''ter'' with regard to the perfect.

:'' Yo ya '''había''' comido cuando mi madre volvió.'' (Spanish) [imperfect form of ''haber'']
:'' Eu já comera quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [pluperfect inherited from [[Latin]]]
:'' Eu já '''tinha''' comido quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect form of ''ter'']
:'' Eu já '''havia''' comido quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect form of ''haver'']
:'I '''had''' already eaten when my mother returned.'

====Imperfect subjunctive versus pluperfect indicative====
A class of [[false friend]]s between the two languages is composed of the verb forms with endings containing -''ra''-, such as ''cantara'', ''cantaras'', ''cantáramos'', and so on. Spanish has two forms for the imperfect [[subjunctive]], one with endings in ''-se-'' and another with endings in -''ra''- (e.g., ''cantase''/''cantara'' 'were I to sing'), which are usually interchangeable. In Portuguese, only ''cantasse'' has this value; ''cantara'' is employed as a [[pluperfect]] indicative, i.e., the equivalent to Spanish ''había cantado'' ('I had sung'). Although there is a strong tendency to use a verb phrase instead in the spoken language, like in Spanish and English (''tinha cantado''), the simple tense is still frequent in literature.

====Present perfect====
In European Spanish, as in English, the [[present perfect]] is normally used to talk about an action initiated and completed in the past, which is still considered relevant or influential in the present moment. In Portuguese and Latin American Spanish, the same meaning is conveyed by the simple [[preterite]], as in the examples below:

:''No, gracias. Ya '''he cenado'''.'' (Spanish, Spain) [present perfect]
:''No, gracias. Ya '''cené'''.'' (Spanish, Latin America) [preterite]
:''Não, obrigado. Já '''jantei'''.'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:'No, thank you. '''I have''' already '''dined'''.' [present perfect]

:'''''He ido''' a España dos veces.'' (Spanish, Spain) [present perfect]
:'''''Fui''' a España dos veces.'' (Spanish, Latin America) [preterite]
:'''''Fui''' a Espanha duas vezes.'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:''''I have been''' to Spain twice.' [present perfect]

:''¿'''Ha oído''' usted las últimas noticias, señor?'' (Spanish, Spain) [present perfect]
:''¿'''Oyó''' usted las últimas noticias, señor?'' (Spanish, Latin America) [preterite]
:''O senhor '''ouviu''' as últimas notícias?'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:''''Have you heard''' the latest news, sir?' [present perfect]

Portuguese normally uses the present perfect (''pretérito perfeito composto'') for speaking of an event that began in the past, was repeated regularly up to the present, and could keep happening in the future. See the contrast with Spanish in the following example:

:'''''He pensado''' en pedirle matrimonio.'' (Spanish) [present perfect]
:''''I have thought''' of asking her/him [indirect object] to marry me [the thought has occurred to me at least once].' [present perfect]
:'''''Tenho pensado''' em pedi-la em casamento.'' (Portuguese) [present perfect]
:''''I have been thinking''' of asking her [direct object] to marry me.' [present perfect continuous]

As this example suggests, the Portuguese present perfect is often closer in meaning to the English present perfect ''continuous''. See also [[Spanish verbs#Contrasting the preterite and the perfect|Spanish verbs: Contrasting the preterite and the perfect]].

====Personal infinitive====
Portuguese, uniquely among the major Romance languages, has acquired a [[Portuguese verb conjugation|"personal infinitive"]], which can be used as an alternative to a subordinate clause with a finite verb in the subjunctive. 
:''A recepcionista pediu para '''esperarmos'''.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''A recepcionista pediu que '''esperássemos'''.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect subjunctive]
:''La recepcionista nos pidió que '''esperáramos'''/'''esperásemos'''.'' (Spanish) [imperfect subjunctive]
:'The receptionist asked for '''us to wait'''.' (literal personal infinitive translation)
:'The receptionist asked that '''we wait'''.' (literal Portuguese imperfect subjunctive translation)

The Portuguese perfect form of the personal infinitive corresponds to one of several possible Spanish finite verbs.
:''Alguém nos acusou de '''termos roubado''' uma caneta.'' (Portuguese)
:''Alguien nos acusó de '''haber robado''' un bolígrafo.'' (Spanish)
:'Somebody accused us of '''having stolen''' a pen.'

On some occasions, the personal infinitive can hardly be replaced by a finite clause and corresponds to a different structure in Spanish (and English):
:''O hábito de '''fumares''' à janela é desagradável.'' (Portuguese, using personal infinitive. Literally, 'The habit of '''[you] smoking''' at the window is unpleasant.')
:''(O) teu hábito de '''fumar''' à janela é desagradável.'' (Portuguese, using '''im'''personal infinitive. Literally, '(The) Your habit of '''smoking''' at the window is unpleasant.')
:''Tu hábito de '''fumar''' junto a una ventana es desagradable.'' (Spanish: 'Your habit of smoking close to a window is unpleasant.')

The personal infinitive is ''not'' used in counterfactual situations, as these require either the future subjunctive or the imperfect subjunctive. 'If we were/had been rich...' is ''Se fôssemos ricos...'', not ''*Se sermos ricos...'' Also, it is conjugated the same as the future subjunctive (see next section), provided the latter is not irregular (''ser'', ''estar'', ''ter'', etc.) The personal infinitive is ''never'' irregular, though the circumflex accent may be dropped in writing on expanded forms (such as ''pôr'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.verbix.com/webverbix/Portuguese.html?verb=p%C3%B4r&amp;D1=2&amp;H1=102&amp;imageField.x=12&amp;imageField.y=1|title=Verbix -- conjugate Portuguese verbs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first and third person singular, the personal infinitive appears no different from the unconjugated infinitive.

:''É bom eu/ele '''esperar''' um bocadinho.'' (Portuguese)
:'It is good that I/he wait(s) a bit.'

The above rules also apply whenever the subjects of the two clauses are the same, but independent of each other.
:''Para '''chegarmos''' cedo, temos/teremos que nos apressar.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''Para que '''lleguemos''' temprano, necesitamos apresurarnos.'' (Spanish) [present subjunctive]
:'For '''us to arrive''' early, we &lt;u&gt; will &lt;/u&gt; need to hurry.'

:''Para '''chegarmos''' cedo, tínhamos/teríamos que nos apressar.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''Para que '''llegáramos'''/'''llegásemos''' temprano, necesitaríamos apresurarnos.'' (Spanish) [imperfect subjunctive]
:'For '''us to arrive''' early, we &lt;u&gt; would &lt;/u&gt; need to hurry.'

As shown, the personal infinitive can be used at times to replace both the impersonal infinitive and the subjunctive. Spanish has no such alternative.

====Future subjunctive====
The future subjunctive, now virtually obsolete in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Butt &amp; Benjamin 2011:282&lt;/ref&gt; continues in use in both written and spoken Portuguese. It is used in [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]] referring to a hypothetical future event or state – either [[adverbial clause]]s (usually introduced by ''se'' 'if ' or ''quando'' 'when') or [[Relative clause|adjective clauses]] that modify nouns referring to a hypothetical future entity. Spanish, in the analogous if-clauses, uses the present indicative{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, and in the ''cuando-'' and adjective clauses uses the present subjunctive.

:''Se eu '''for''''' ''eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.'' (Portuguese)
:''Si yo '''soy''''' (also '''fuere''''') ''elegido presidente, cambiaré la ley.'' (Spanish)
:'If I '''am''' elected president, I will change the law.'

:''Quando '''fores''''' ''mais velho, compreenderás.'' (Portuguese)
:''Cuando '''seas''''' (also '''fueres''''') ''mayor, comprenderás.'' (Spanish)
:'When you '''are''' older, you'll understand.'

:''Dar-se-á/Se dará o prêmio à primeira pessoa que '''disser''' a resposta correta.'' (Portuguese)
:''Se dará el premio a la primera persona que '''diga''' (also '''dijere''') la respuesta correcta.'' (Spanish)
:'The prize will be given to the first person who '''says''' the right answer.'

====Irregular verbs====
A number of irregular verbs in Portuguese change the main vowel to indicate differences between first and third person singular: ''fiz'' 'I did' vs ''fez'' 'he did', ''pude'' 'I could' vs ''pôde'' 'he could', ''fui'' 'I was' vs ''foi'' 'he was', ''tive'' 'I had' vs ''teve'' 'he had', etc. These vowel differences stem from vowel raising ([[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]]) triggered historically by the final {{sm|-'''ī'''}} of the first-person singular in Latin. Spanish maintains such a difference only in ''fui'' 'I was' vs ''fue'' 'he was'. In all other cases, one of the two vowels has been regularized throughout the conjugation and a new third-person ending ''-o'' adopted: ''hice'' 'I did' vs ''hizo'' 'he did', ''pude'' 'I could' vs ''pudo'' 'he could', etc.

Contrarily, Spanish maintains many more irregular forms in the future and conditional: ''saldré'' 'I will leave', ''pondré'' 'I will put', ''vendré'' 'I will come', ''diré'' 'I will say', etc. Portuguese has only three: ''farei'' 'I will do', ''direi'' 'I will say', ''trarei'' 'I will carry'.

Portuguese drops -''e'' in "irregular" third-person singular present indicative forms after ⟨z⟩ and ⟨r⟩, according to phonological rules: ''faz'' 'he does', ''diz'' 'he says', ''quer'' 'he wants', etc. Spanish has restored -''e'' by analogy with other verbs: ''hace'' 'he does', ''dice'' 'he says', ''quiere'' 'he wants', etc. (The same type of analogy accounts for ''fiz'' vs ''hice'' 'I did' in the past tense. In nouns such as ''paz'' 'peace', ''luz'' 'light', ''amor'' 'love', etc. ''-e'' was dropped in both languages and never restored).

===Prepositions===

====Contractions====
In Spanish the prepositions ''a'' ('to') and ''de'' ('of, from') form [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] with a following masculine singular definite article (''el'' 'the'): ''a'' + ''el'' &gt; ''al'', and ''de'' + ''el'' &gt; ''del''. This kind of contraction is much more extensive in Portuguese, involving the prepositions ''a'' ('to'), ''de'' ('of, from'), ''em'' ('in'), and ''por'' ('for') with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[demonstratives]] regardless of number or gender.&lt;ref&gt;See a list at [[:pt:Anexo:Lista de contrações na língua portuguesa|Wikipedia in Portuguese: List of contracted prepositions]]&lt;/ref&gt; All four of these prepositions join with the definite article, as shown in the following table:

{|class="wikitable"
! Preposition +&lt;br&gt;definite article&lt;br&gt;(Portuguese)
! ''a''
! ''de''
! ''em''
! ''por''
|-
| style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''o''&lt;br&gt;(masc.sing.) ||align=center| ''ao'' ||align=center| ''do'' || ''no'' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ''pelo''
|- 
| style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''a''&lt;br&gt;(fem.sing.) ||align=center| ''à'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ||align=center| ''da'' || ''na'' || ''pela''
|-
| style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''os''&lt;br&gt;(masc.pl.) ||align=center| ''aos'' ||align=center| ''dos'' &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ''nos'' || ''pelos'' 
|-
| style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''as''&lt;br&gt;(fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''às'' ||align=center| ''das'' || ''nas'' ||''pelas'' 
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;These Portuguese contractions include some potential "[[false friends]]" for the reader of Spanish, such as ''no'' (Port. 'in the', Sp. 'no, not') and ''dos'' (Port. 'of the', Sp. 'two').&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;In European Portuguese, ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, while ''à'' is pronounced {{IPA|[a]}}. Both are generally {{IPA|[a]}} in most of Brazil, although in some accents such as ''carioca'' and ''florianopolitano'' there may be distinction.&lt;/small&gt;

Additionally, the prepositions ''de'' and ''em'' combine with the demonstrative adjectives and pronouns as shown below:
{|class="wikitable"
! Preposition +&lt;br&gt;demonstrative&lt;br&gt;(Portuguese)
! ''de''
! ''em''
|-
| style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''este'' (masc.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''esta'' (fem.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''estes'' (masc.pl.)&lt;br&gt;''estas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''deste''&lt;br&gt;''desta''&lt;br&gt;''destes''&lt;br&gt;''destas'' ||align=center| ''neste''&lt;br&gt;''nesta''&lt;br&gt;''nestes''&lt;br&gt;''nestas'' 
|- 
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''esse'' (masc.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''essa'' (fem.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''esses'' (masc.pl.)&lt;br&gt;''essas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''desse''&lt;br&gt;''dessa''&lt;br&gt;''desses''&lt;br&gt;''dessas'' ||align=center| ''nesse''&lt;br&gt;''nessa''&lt;br&gt;''nesses''&lt;br&gt;''nessas''
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''aquele'' (masc.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''aquela'' (fem.sing.)&lt;br&gt;''aqueles'' (masc.pl.)&lt;br&gt;''aquelas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''daquele''&lt;br&gt;''daquela''&lt;br&gt;''daqueles''&lt;br&gt;''daquelas'' ||align=center| ''naquele''&lt;br&gt;''naquela''&lt;br&gt;''naqueles''&lt;br&gt;''naquelas''
|}

The neuter demonstrative pronouns (''isto'' 'this' ''isso'', ''aquilo'' 'that') likewise combine with ''de'' and ''em'' – thus, ''disto'', ''nisto'', etc.  And the preposition ''a'' combines with the "distal" demonstratives (those that begin with ''a-'') to form ''àquele'', ''àquilo'', etc.

The Portuguese contractions mentioned thus far are obligatory.  Contractions can also  be optionally formed from ''em'' and ''de'' with the indefinite article (''um'', ''uma'', ''uns'', ''umas''), resulting in ''num'', ''numa'', ''dum'', ''duma'', etc. and from the third person pronouns (''ele'', ''ela'', ''eles'', ''elas''), resulting in ''nele'', ''nela'', ''dele'', ''dela'', etc.  Other optional contractions include ''de'' with ''aqui'' &gt;  ''daqui'' ('from here').

The Spanish ''con'' ('with', ''com'' in Portuguese) combines with the prepositional pronouns ''mí'', ''ti'', and ''sí'' to form ''conmigo'', ''contigo'', ''consigo'' ('with me', 'with you', 'with him-/herself ').  In Portuguese this process not only applies to the pronouns ''mim'', ''ti'', and ''si'' (giving ''comigo'', ''contigo'', and ''consigo''), but also is extended to ''nós'' and, in those varieties which use it, ''vós'', producing ''connosco'' (''conosco'' in Brazilian Portuguese) and ''convosco''.

====Personal "''a''"====
Spanish employs a preposition, the so-called "personal ''a''", before the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]] (except ''tener'') when it denotes a specific person(s), or domestic [[pet]]; thus ''Veo '''a''' Juan'' 'I see John'; ''Hemos invitado '''a''' los estudiantes'' 'We've invited the students.'
In Portuguese, personal ''a'' is virtually non-existent, except before ''Deus'' 'God':  ''louvar '''a''' Deus'' 'to praise God', ''amar '''a''' Deus'' 'to love God'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ackerlind|Jones-Kellog|2011| p=90n1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Ir a'' versus ''ir para''====
Quite common in both languages are the prepositions ''a'' (which often translates as "to") and ''para'' (which often translates as "for").  However, European Portuguese and Spanish distinguish between going somewhere for a short while versus a longer stay, especially if it is an intended destination, in the latter case using ''para'' instead of ''a''.  While there is no  specified duration of stay before a European Portuguese speaker must switch prepositions, ''a'' implies one will return sooner, rather than later, relative to the context. This distinction is not made in English and Brazilian Portuguese{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. In Spanish the distinction is not made if the duration is given in the context (maybe implicitly), and in this case ''a'' is generally preferred.
 
:''Fui '''a'''l mercado cerca de mi casa.'' (Spanish)
:''Fui '''a'''o mercado perto de/da minha casa.''/''Fui '''para ''' o mercado perto de/da minha casa.'' (European and Brazilian Portuguese)
:'I went '''to''' the market near my house.' [temporary displacement]

:''El presidente anterior fue exiliado '''a''' Portugal.'' (Spanish)
:''O presidente anterior foi exilado '''para''' Portugal.'' (European and Brazilian Portuguese)
:'The former president was exiled '''to''' Portugal.' [permanent, or more lasting displacement]

Note, though, in the first example, ''para'' could be used in Portuguese if in contrast to a very brief period of time.

:''Não fico muito tempo, só um minuto. Tenho que/de ir '''para''' o mercado.'' (Portuguese)
:'I can't stay long, only a minute. I have to go '''to''' the market.' [pending task or appointment]

In informal, non-standard Brazilian Portuguese, ''em'' (in its original form or combined with a given article in a contraction, yielding ''no'', ''na'', ''numa'', etc.), often replaces the preposition ''a'' from standard Portuguese.

:''Vou '''na''' padaria.'' (non-standard Brazilian Portuguese)
:''Vou '''à''' padaria.'' (standard Portuguese)
:'I'm going '''to the''' bakery.'

:''Fui '''numa''' festa ontem.'' (non-standard Brazilian Portuguese)
:''Fui '''a uma''' festa ontem.'' (standard Portuguese)
:'I went '''to a''' party yesterday.'

Such a construction is not used in Spanish or in European Portuguese.

In Portuguese the preposition '''até''' can also be used when the duration of the stay is expected to be short or when there is a specific reason for going somewhere. In Spanish '''hasta''' has the same meaning and function.

:''Vou '''até''' a praia.''
:''Voy '''hasta''' la playa.''
:'I'm going to the beach.'

====''Hacia'' and ''para''====
Spanish has two prepositions of direction: ''para'' ('for', including 'headed for [a destination]') and ''hacia'' ('toward [not necessarily implying arrival]'). Of them, only ''para'' exists in Portuguese, covering both meanings.

:''Este regalo es '''para''' ti''. (Spanish)
:''Este presente é '''para''' ti''. (Portuguese)
:'This gift is '''for''' you.'

:''Aquel/Ese avión va '''hacia''' Brasilia.'' (Spanish)
:''Aquele avião voa '''para''' Brasília.'' (Portuguese)
:'That airplane is flying '''toward''' Brasília.'

Colloquially, ''para'' is often reduced in both languages:  to ''pa''' in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques De Bruyne, ''A Comprehensive Spanish Grammar'' (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1995), §752.&lt;/ref&gt; and to ''pra'' (sometimes written ''p'ra'' and this form may be used in literature) or ''pa'' (only in slang in Portugal and Rio de Janeiro, and not permitted in writing) in Portuguese. Portuguese ''pra'', in turn, may join with the definite article:  ''pra'' + ''o'' &gt; ''pro'' (BP) or ''prò'' (EP), ''pra'' + ''a'' &gt; ''pra'' (BP) or ''prà'' (EP), etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa|Aurélio]] defines the words ''pra¹'' as a syncopated form of ''para'', and ''pra²'' and ''pro'' as a contraction of ''pra¹'' plus the article.&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the slang option ''pa'', these become: ''pa'' + ''o'' &gt; ''pò'', ''pa'' + ''a'' &gt; ''pà'', etc.

===="Going to" future====
Both languages have a construction similar to the [[Going-to future|English "going-to" future]]. Spanish includes the preposition ''a'' between the conjugated form of ''ir'' "to go" and the infinitive: ''Vamos '''a''' cantar'' "We're going to sing" or "Let's sing" (present tense of ''ir'' + ''a'' + infinitive). Usually, in Portuguese, there is no preposition between the helping verb and the main verb: ''Vamos cantar'' (present tense of ''ir'' + infinitive).  This also applies when the verb is in other tenses:

: ''Ayer yo iba '''a''' leer el libro, pero no tuve la oportunidad.'' (Spanish)
: ''Ontem eu ia ler o livro, mas não tive oportunidade.'' (Portuguese)
: Yesterday I was going '''to''' read the book, but never had the chance.

====Other differences in preposition usage====
While as a rule the same prepositions are used in the same contexts in both languages, there are many exceptions.

:''Nuestros gastos '''de''' energía.'' (Spanish)
:''(Os) nossos gastos '''com'''/'''de''' energia.'' (Portuguese)
:Our energy expenses.

:''Voy '''a''' votar '''por''' Juan.'' (Spanish)
:''Vou votar '''em'''/'''no''' João.'' (Portuguese)
:I'm going to vote '''for''' John.

==Orthography==

===Alphabet===
The traditional [[Spanish alphabet]] had 28 letters, while the [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] had 23. Modern versions of recent years added ''k'' and ''w'' (found only in foreign words) to both languages. Portuguese also added ''y'' for loanwords.

With the reform in 1994 by the 10th congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, Spanish alphabetization now follows the same pattern as that of other major West European languages. Prior to this date, however, the digraphs ''ch'' and ''ll'' were independently alphabetized. For example, the following [[surnames]] would be put in this order: ''Cervantes, Contreras, Cruz, '''Ch'''ávez, Dávila''.  Many Spanish dictionaries and other reference material still exist using the pre-reform rule of alphabetization.

:'''Current Spanish alphabet''' ([[Spanish orthography|Spanish alphabet reform of 1994]])
&lt;big&gt;
::''[[a]] [[b]] [[c]] [[d]] [[e]] [[f]] [[g]] [[h]] [[i]] [[j]] [[k]] [[l]] [[m]] [[n]] [[ñ]] [[o]] [[p]] [[q]] [[r]] [[s]] [[t]] [[u]] [[v]] [[w]] [[x]] [[y]] [[z]]''
&lt;/big&gt;
:Digraphs
&lt;big&gt;
::''[[ch (digraph)|ch]] [[ll (digraph)|ll]] [[rr (digraph)|rr]] [[gu (digraph)|gu]] [[qu (digraph)|qu]]''
&lt;/big&gt;

:'''Current Portuguese alphabet''' ([[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990]]) introducing ''k'', ''w'' and ''y''
&lt;big&gt;
::''[[a]] [[b]] [[c]] [[d]] [[e]] [[f]] [[g]] [[h]] [[i]] [[j]] [[k]] [[l]] [[m]] [[n]] [[o]] [[p]] [[q]] [[r]] [[s]] [[t]] [[u]] [[v]] [[w]] [[x]] [[y]] [[z]]''
&lt;/big&gt;
:Digraphs
&lt;big&gt;
::''[[ch (digraph)|ch]] [[lh (digraph)|lh]] [[nh (digraph)|nh]] [[rr (digraph)|rr]] [[gu (digraph)|gu]] [[qu (digraph)|qu]] [[ss (digraph)|ss]]'' (''cc cç sc sç xc xs'')
&lt;/big&gt;

⟨Sc⟩ in Latin American Spanish is not called a digraph, however it is a single sound as in Brazilian Portuguese. Also Spanish has taken ⟨sh⟩ {{IPA|/ʃ/}} from English as a loan sound; e.g., ''sherpa'', ''show'', ''flash''. Brazilian Portuguese uses the trigraph ⟨tch⟩ {{IPA|/tʃ/}} for loanwords; e.g., ''tchau'', '[[ciao]]', ''tcheco'' 'Czech', ''República Tcheca'' 'Czech Republic', ''tchê'' '[[che (Spanish)|che]]'&amp;nbsp;(this latter is regional), etc. European Portuguese normally replace the trigraph ⟨tch⟩ with ⟨ch⟩ {{IPA|/ʃ/}}: ''chau'', ''checo'', ''República Checa'', etc.

Both Spanish and Portuguese use ⟨zz⟩ {{IPA|/ts/}} (never as {{IPA|/dz/}} – this sequence appears only in loanwords from Japanese, e.g., [[Azuki bean|''adzuki'']]) for some Italian loanwords, but in Portuguese may sometimes not be pronounced as affricate, but having an [[Portuguese phonology#Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɨ/}}; e.g., Sp. and Port. ''pizza'' 'pizza', Sp. and Port. ''paparazzo'' 'paparazzo', etc. Spanish also utilizes ⟨tz⟩ {{IPA|/ts/}} for Basque, Catalan and Nahuatl loanwords, and ⟨tl⟩ {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (or {{IPA|/tl/}}) for Nahuatl loanwords; e.g., ''Ertzaintza'', ''quetzal'', ''xoloitzcuintle'', ''Tlaxcala'', etc. Portuguese utilizes ⟨ts⟩ for [[German language|German]], originarily ⟨z⟩, and Japanese loanwords.

===Question and exclamation marks===

Only in Spanish do interrogatives and exclamations use the question mark or exclamation point respectively at the beginning of a sentence. The same punctuation marks are used, but these are inverted. This prepares the reader in advance for either a question or exclamation type of sentence.

:Interrogative: ''¿Cuántos años tienes?'' (Spanish)
:Exclamation: ''¡Cuidado con el perro!''  (Spanish)

On the other hand, in Portuguese, a person reading aloud lengthy sentences from an unfamiliar text may have to scan ahead to check if what at first appears to be a statement, is actually a question. Otherwise, it would be too late to enable proper voice inflection. Neither language has the equivalent of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'', which is often used to begin a question in English. Both Spanish and English can place the verb before the subject noun to indicate a question, though this is uncommon in Portuguese, and almost unheard of in Brazil. In fact, most yes/no questions in Portuguese are written the same as a statement except for the final question mark.

:Spanish: '''''¿Tiene usted''' una medida de cuál es su exposición a estos riesgos, y '''está usted''' confiado de que su organización está minimizando el impacto de los mismos sobre sus accionistas, equipo de trabajo y otros grupos interesados'''?'''''

:Portuguese: ''Você tem ideia de qual é a sua exposição a esses riscos, e tem confiança que a sua organização está minimizando os impactos resultantes, nos seus acionistas, funcionários e outros interessados'''?'''''

:English: ''''Do you''' have a measure of what your exposure is to these risks, and '''are you''' confident that your organization is minimizing their impact on your shareholders, staff, and other interested parties'''?''''

Aside from changes of punctuation in written language, in speech, converting any of the above examples from a question to a statement would involve changes of both intonation and syntax in English and Spanish, but intonation only in Portuguese.

===Different spellings for similar sounds===
The [[palatal consonant]]s are spelled differently in the two languages.

{|class="wikitable"

! rowspan="2" | Description
! colspan="2" | Spanish

|- align=center
! Spelling
! Pronunciation
! Spelling
! Pronunciation
|- align=center
| style="background:#dbdbdb;"|palatal "l" || ''ll'' || {{IPA|ʎ}} (~ {{IPA|ʝ}})&lt;ref&gt;The phoneme represented by ⟨ll⟩ has merged with the one represented by ⟨y⟩ in most dialects, commonly realized as {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, or, in [[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]], as {{IPA|[ʒ]}} or as {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; || ''lh'' || {{IPA|ʎ}}
|- align=center
| style="background:#dbdbdb;"|palatal "n" || ''ñ'' || {{IPA|ɲ}} || ''nh'' || {{IPA|ɲ}} (EP), {{IPA|j̃}} (BP)
|- align=center
| style="background:#dbdbdb;"|palatal "y" || ''y'' || {{IPA|ʝ}} || ''i'' || {{IPA|j}}
|}

The symbols ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ are etymological in Spanish, as the sounds they represent are often derived from Latin {{sm|ll}} and {{sm|nn}} (for those positions, Portuguese has simple ⟨l⟩ and ⟨n⟩; cf. ''rodilla''/''rodela'', ''peña''/''pena''). The Portuguese digraphs ⟨lh⟩ and ⟨nh⟩ were adopted from [[Occitan]], as [[Occitan literature|poetry of the troubadours]] was the most important influence on Portuguese literature up until the 14th century. King [[Denis of Portugal]], who established Portuguese instead of Latin as the official language, was an admirer of the [[Occitan literature|poetry of the troubadours]] and a poet himself. Examples include names such as Port. ''[[Minho River|''Mi'''nh'''o'']]'' (Sp. ''Mi'''ñ'''o'') and ''[[Ferdinand Magellan|''Maga'''lh'''ães'']]'' (Sp. ''Maga'''ll'''anes'').

The letter ⟨y⟩ was used in Portuguese from the 16th to the early 20th century in [[Greek language|Greek]] loans, much as in English (e.g., ''Psychologia'', modern ''Psicologia'' 'Psychology'). The orthographic reform in 1911 officially replaced it with ⟨i⟩. The corresponding sound can be regarded as an [[allophone]] of the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in both languages. Compare Sp. ''re'''y''''' ('king'), ''ma'''y'''or'' ('larger, greater, elder') with Port. ''re'''i''''' ('king'), ''ma'''i'''or'' ('larger, greater').

The exact pronunciation of these three consonants varies somewhat with dialect. The table indicates only the most common sound values in each language. In most Spanish dialects, the consonants written ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨y⟩ have come to be pronounced the same way, a sound merger known as ''[[yeísmo]]''. A similar phenomenon can be found in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese (e.g., “''muié''” for ''mulher'', 'woman'), but it is much less widespread than in Spanish.

The Portuguese letter ⟨ç⟩ ([[Ç|c-cedilha]]), based on a [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] form of the letter ⟨z⟩: "[[ꝣ]]". In Portuguese it is used before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (including nasals), and never at the beginning or end of any word. It always represents the "soft ''c''"  sound, namely {{IPAblink|s}}. In modern Spanish, it has been replaced by ⟨z⟩. Example: ''cal'''z'''ado'' (Sp.), ''cal'''ç'''ado'' (Port.) 'footwear'.

===Correspondences between word endings===
Various word endings are consistently different in the two languages.

* Spanish -''n'' corresponds to Portuguese -''m'' when in word-final position (e.g., Spanish: ''jardín'', ''algún''; Portuguese: ''jardim'', ''algum''). In Portuguese, word- or syllable-final ⟨m⟩ and ⟨n⟩ indicate nasalization of the previous vowel; e.g., ''som'' {{IPA|/ˈsõ/}} 'sound' (see [[#Phonology|phonology]] below). In the plural, ⟨m⟩ is replaced with an ⟨n⟩ (Spanish: ''jardines, algunos''; Portuguese: ''jardins, alguns''), that is because in these cases the ⟨m⟩ is not in word-final position anymore. Notice, some rare learned words in Portuguese and Spanish may also have a word final -''n'' (e.g., Portuguese ''abdómen/abdômen'' 'abdomen'), and -''m'' (e.g., Spanish ''tándem'' 'tandem'), respectively.
* Common exceptions to the above rule concern the Spanish noun endings:
** -''án'' and -''ano'', which normally correspond to -''ão'' or -''ã'' in Portuguese (''Irán'' vs ''Irão'' (EP)/''Irã'' (BP) 'Iran', ''hermano'' vs ''irmão'' 'brother', and ''huérfano'' vs ''órfão'', 'orphan [[grammatical gender|m.]]');
**-''ana'', which corresponds to -''ã'' (''hermana'' vs ''irmã'' 'sister', ''mañana'' vs ''manhã'' 'morning', ''huérfana'' vs ''órfã'' 'orphan [[grammatical gender|f.]]');
** -''ón'' / -''ción'' or -''cción'' / -''sión'', which usually correspond to -''ão'' / -''ção'' or -''(c)ção'' / ''-são'' or ''-ssão'' (''melón'' vs ''melão'' 'melon', ''opción'' vs ''opção'' 'option', ''corrección'' vs ''corre(c)ção'' 'correction', ''pensión'' vs ''pensão'' 'pension', or ''admisión'' vs ''admissão'' 'admission');
**-''on'' or -''an'', which corresponds to -''ão'' in most monosyllables (''son'' vs ''são'' 'they are', ''tan'' vs ''tão'' 'as, so');
* The singular noun or adjective endings ''-án'' and ''-ón'' in Spanish both usually correspond to Portuguese ''-ão'', and likewise the Spanish ending ''-ano'' often corresponds to Portuguese ''-ão'' (although there are also many Portuguese words ending in ''-ano'', including [[Demonym|gentilics]] such as ''cubano'', ''boliviano'', etc.). The ''plurals'' of the Portuguese words in ''-ão'', however, generally preserve the historical distinctions: Portuguese -''ãos'', -''ães'', and -''ões'' generally correspond to Spanish ''-anos'', ''-anes'', and ''-ones'', respectively:
** -''ãos'', as in ''mão/mãos'' (Spanish ''mano/manos'', English 'hand(s)');
** -''ães'', as in ''capitão/capitães'' (Spanish ''capitán/capitanes'', English 'captain(s)');
** -''ões'', as in ''melão/melões'' (Spanish ''melón/melones'', English 'melon(s)').
* Notable exceptions to the above rule:
** ''verão/verões'' (Spanish ''verano(s)'', English 'summer(s)');
** ''vulcão/vulcões'' (Spanish ''volcán/volcanes'', English 'volcano');
** ''ancião'', which allows the three plural forms: ''anciãos'', ''anciães'' and ''anciões'' (Spanish ''anciano(s)'', English 'elder(s)').
** ''guardião'', which allows the three plural forms: ''guardiãos'', ''guardiães'' and ''guardiões'' (Spanish ''guardián/guardianes'', English 'guardian');  
** ''vilão'', which allows the three plural forms: ''vilãos'', ''vilães'' and ''vilões'' (Spanish ''villano/villanos'', English 'villain');
** ''João/Joões'' (Spanish ''Juan/Juanes'', English 'John'). This plural can be seen in words such as ''joão-de-barro/joões-de-barro'' (Red Ovenbird).
* The 3rd person plural endings of the [[preterite|preterite indicative tense]] are spelled with -''on'' in Spanish (''pensaron, vivieron'' 'they thought, they lived'), but with -''am'' in Portuguese (''pensaram, viveram'').
*In Portuguese words ending in -''l'' form their plurals by dropping ⟨l⟩ and adding -''is'' (-''eis'' when final unstressed -''il''): ''caracol/caracóis'' (Spanish ''caracol(es)'', English 'snail(s)'), ''fácil/fáceis'' (Spanish ''fácil(es)'', English 'easy').
* In Spanish, adjectives and nouns ending in -''z'' form their plurals by replacing ⟨z⟩ with ⟨c⟩ (-''ces''); e.g., ''feroz''/''feroces'' (Portuguese ''feroz(es)'', English 'ferocious'), ''vez''/''veces'' (Portuguese ''vez(es)'' English 'time(s)').
* Another conspicuous difference is the use of -''z'' in Spanish versus -''s'' in Portuguese at the end of unstressed syllables, especially when the consonant is the last letter in a word. A few examples:

:''Álvarez'', ''Fernández'', ''Suárez'', ''izquierda'', ''mezquino'', ''lápiz'' (Spanish)
:''Álvares'', ''Fernandes'', ''Soares'', ''esquerda'', ''mesquinho'', ''lápis'' (Portuguese)

*Other correspondences between word endings are:&lt;!-- this could be moved to "grammar" --&gt;

The word ending -''zade(s)'' is also found in Portuguese, e.g., ''amizade(s)'' (Spanish ''amistad(es)'', English 'friendship(s)');

===Accentuation and nasalization===
Both languages use [[diacritic]]s to mark the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed syllable]] of a word whenever it is not otherwise predictable from spelling. Since Spanish does not differentiate between mid-open and mid-close vowels and [[nasal vowels]], it uses only one accent, the [[acute accent|acute]]. Portuguese usually uses the acute accent ( '''´''' ), but also uses the [[circumflex accent]] ( '''ˆ''' ) on the mid-close vowels ⟨ê⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ and the stressed (always nasal in Brasil) ⟨â⟩.

Although the Spanish ⟨y⟩ can be either a consonant or a vowel, as a vowel it never takes an accent.  At the end of a word, the Portuguese [[diphthong]] -''ai'' is the equivalent of the Spanish -''ay'', however, -''ai'' can have an accent on the ⟨í⟩ to [[Hiatus (linguistics)|break the diphthong]] into two separate vowels, e.g., ''açaí'' (three syllables). Without the accent, as in Spanish, the last syllable would be a diphthong: ''Parag&lt;u&gt;uai&lt;/u&gt;'' (Portuguese) and ''Parag&lt;u&gt;uay&lt;/u&gt;'' (Spanish) 'Paraguay'.

Portuguese nasal vowels occur before ⟨n⟩ and ⟨m⟩ (see [[#Phonology|phonology]] below) without an accent mark, as these consonants are not fully pronounced in such cases.  The [[tilde]] (~), is only used on nasal diphthongs such as ⟨ão⟩ {{IPA|[ɐ̃w̃]}} and ⟨õe⟩ {{IPA|[õj̃]}}, plus the final ⟨ã⟩ {{IPA|[ɐ̃]}}, which replaces the -''am'' ending, as the latter is reserved for verbs, e.g., ''amanh&lt;u&gt;ã&lt;/u&gt;'' {{IPA|[amɐˈɲɐ̃]}} 'tomorrow'.
  
* Initial and middle: [[vowel]] + ⟨n⟩ + [[consonant]] (except ⟨h⟩, ⟨p⟩ or ⟨b⟩): ''&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;teced&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;te'', ''ger&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;g&lt;u&gt;on&lt;/u&gt;ça'', ''m&lt;u&gt;un&lt;/u&gt;do'', ''&lt;u&gt;ên&lt;/u&gt;fase'' &amp;nbsp;
* Initial and middle: [[vowel]] + ⟨m⟩ + [[bilabial consonant]] (⟨p⟩ or ⟨b⟩): ''caç&lt;u&gt;am&lt;/u&gt;ba'', ''&lt;u&gt;em&lt;/u&gt;prego'', ''sup&lt;u&gt;im&lt;/u&gt;pa'', ''p&lt;u&gt;om&lt;/u&gt;ba'', ''pen&lt;u&gt;um&lt;/u&gt;bra'' &amp;nbsp;
* Final: [[vowel]] + ⟨m⟩: ''fizer&lt;u&gt;am&lt;/u&gt;'', ''&lt;u&gt;em&lt;/u&gt;'', ''ru&lt;u&gt;im&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;om&lt;/u&gt;'', ''alg&lt;u&gt;um&lt;/u&gt;'' (except for learned words, e.g., ''abdóm&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;''/''abdôm&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;'', ''híf&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;'', etc.)

These do not alter the rules for stress, though note endings -''im'', -''ins'' and -''um'', -''uns'' are stressed, as are their non-nasal counterparts (see below). A couple of two-letter words consist of only the nasal vowel:  ''em'' and ''um''.

Phonetic vowel nasalization occurs in Spanish—vowels may get slightly nasalized in contact with nasal consonants—but it is not phonemically distinctive.  In Portuguese, on the other hand, vowel nasalization is distinctive, and therefore phonemic: ''pois'' {{IPA|/ˈpojs/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpojʃ/}} 'because' vs ''pões'' {{IPA|/ˈpõj̃s/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpõj̃ʃ/}} '(you) put'.

Portuguese changes vowel sounds with (and without) accents marks. Unaccented ⟨o⟩ ({{IPA|/u/, /o/, /ɔ/}}) and ⟨e⟩ ({{IPA|/i/, /ɨ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ɐ/}}), acute accented ⟨ó⟩ ({{IPA|/ɔ/}}) and ⟨é⟩ ({{IPA|/ɛ/}}), or circumflex accented ⟨ô⟩ ({{IPA|/o/}}) and ⟨e⟩ ({{IPA|/e/}}).  Thus, ''nós'' {{IPA|[ˈnɔs]}} or {{IPA|[ˈnɔʃ]}} 'we' vs ''nos'' {{IPA|[nus]}} or {{IPA|[nuʃ]}} 'us', ''avô'' {{IPA|[aˈvo]}} 'grandfather' vs ''avó'' {{IPA|[aˈvɔ]}} 'grandmother', ''se'' {{IPA|[si]}} or {{IPA|[sɨ]}} 'itself, himself, herself' reflexive pronoun vs ''sé'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛ]}} 'seat, headquarters' vs ''sê'' {{IPA|[ˈse]}} 'to be' 2nd person imperative. Spanish pronunciation makes no such distinction.

The [[grave accent]] ( '''`''' ) is also used in Portuguese to indicate the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the preposition ''a'' (to) with a few words beginning with the vowel ''a'', but not to indicate stress. In other cases, it is the combination of the preposition and the feminine definite article; in other words, the equivalent of ''a la'' ('to the') in Spanish. ''Às'' is used for the plural (''a las'' in Spanish).

* ''a'' (prep.) + ''a(s)'' (def. article 'the') = ''à(s)'' ('to the').
* ''a'' (prep.) + ''aquele(s), aquela(s)'' (pron. 'that') = ''à&lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt;le(s), à&lt;u&gt;que&lt;/u&gt;la(s)''—underlined stressed syllable—('to that').
* ''a'' (prep.) + ''aquilo'' (pron. n. 'that') = ''à&lt;u&gt;qui&lt;/u&gt;lo'' ('to that').

The [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] or trema ( '''¨''' ) is used in Spanish to indicate ⟨u⟩ is pronounced in the sequence ⟨gu⟩; e.g., ''desagüe'' {{IPA|[deˈsaɣwe]}}. As the Portuguese grave accent, the trema does not indicate stress. In Brazilian Portuguese it was also used for the digraphs ⟨gu⟩ and ⟨qu⟩ for the same purpose as Spanish (e.g., former BP spelling *''qüinqüênio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwẽɲu]}}, EP ''quinquénio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwɛnju]}} 'five-year period'), however since the implementation of the Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement in Brazil, the trema was abolished (current BP spelling ''quinquênio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwẽɲu]}}), and its usage was restricted to some loanwords (e.g., ''mülleriano'' 'Müllerian').

The accentuation rules (including those of predictable stress) of Portuguese and Spanish are similar, but not identical. Discrepancies are especially pervasive in words that contain ''i'' or ''u'' in their last syllable.  Note the Portuguese diphthongs ''ei'' and ''ou'' are the approximate Spanish equivalent of ''e'' and ''o'' respectively, but any word ending with these diphthongs is, by default, stressed on its final syllable.

Compare the following pairs of cognates, where the stress falls on the same syllable in both languages:

:{| cellspacing="3px"
|- 
| ''&lt;u&gt;ta&lt;/u&gt;xi'', || ''vi&lt;u&gt;ví&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''bam&lt;u&gt;bú&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;sia'', || ''&lt;u&gt;se&lt;/u&gt;ria'', || ''se&lt;u&gt;rí&lt;/u&gt;a'', || ''jar&lt;u&gt;dín&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''pen&lt;u&gt;sáis&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''pen&lt;u&gt;só&lt;/u&gt;''
| (Spanish)
|- 
| ''&lt;u&gt;tá&lt;/u&gt;xi'', || ''vi&lt;u&gt;vi&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''bam&lt;u&gt;bu&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''&lt;u&gt;ân&lt;/u&gt;sia'', || ''&lt;u&gt;sé&lt;/u&gt;ria'', || ''se&lt;u&gt;ri&lt;/u&gt;a'', || ''jar&lt;u&gt;dim&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''pen&lt;u&gt;sais&lt;/u&gt;'', || ''pen&lt;u&gt;sou&lt;/u&gt;''
| (Portuguese)
|}

Semivowel–vowel sequences are treated differently in both languages when it comes to accentuation rules. A sequence of a semivowel adjacent to a vowel is by default assumed to be read as a [[diphthong]] (part of the same syllable) in Spanish, whereas it is by default assumed to be read as a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (belonging to different syllables) in Portuguese. For both languages, accentuation rules consistently indicate something other than the default.

A consequence of this is that words that are pronounced alike in both languages are written according to different accentuation rules. Some examples:

* ''emer&lt;u&gt;gen&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Spanish), ''emer&lt;u&gt;gên&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Portuguese) 'emergency'
* ''tole&lt;u&gt;ran&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Spanish), ''tole&lt;u&gt;rân&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Portuguese) 'tolerance'
* ''au&lt;u&gt;da&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Spanish), ''au&lt;u&gt;dá&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Portuguese) 'audace'
* ''&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;cio'' (Spanish), ''&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;cio'' (Portuguese) 'leisure'
* ''con&lt;u&gt;ti&lt;/u&gt;nuo'' (Spanish), ''con&lt;u&gt;tí&lt;/u&gt;nuo'' (Portuguese) 'continuous'
* ''conti&lt;u&gt;nú&lt;/u&gt;o'' (Spanish), ''conti&lt;u&gt;nu&lt;/u&gt;o'' (Portuguese) 'I continue'

Another consequence (though less common) is that some words are written exactly (or almost exactly) the same in both languages, but the stress falls on different syllables:

* ''demo&lt;u&gt;cra&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Spanish, [[rising diphthong]] at the end), ''democra&lt;u&gt;ci&lt;/u&gt;a'' (Portuguese, the stress on -''ci''- [[Hiatus (linguistics)|breaks the diphthong]]) 'democracy'
* ''poli&lt;u&gt;cí&lt;/u&gt;a'' (Spanish, the stress on -''cí''- breaks the diphthong), ''po&lt;u&gt;lí&lt;/u&gt;cia'' (Portuguese) 'police'

==Phonology==
Although the vocabularies of Spanish and Portuguese are similar, the two languages differ phonologically from each other, very likely because of the stronger [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] substratum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XmB-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=portuguese+celtic+phonology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TI6_dp08cM&amp;sig=HJRg557aN9rgD6VdE4np07diDNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidlaS4ofXUAhWsKcAKHbxSCrM4ChDoAQgqMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=portuguese+celtic+phonology&amp;f=false|title=Anaphora in Celtic and Universal Grammar|first=R.|last=Hendrick|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Portuguese. Phonetically Portuguese bears  similarities to [[French language|French]] and to [[Catalan language|Catalan]] while the phonetics of Spanish are more comparable to those of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. Portuguese has a significantly larger phonemic inventory than Spanish. This may partially explain why it is generally not very intelligible to Spanish speakers despite the lexical similarity between the two languages.

One of the main differences between the Spanish and Portuguese pronunciation are the vowel sounds. Standard Spanish has a basic vowel phonological system, with five phonemic vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ä|a}}, {{IPAslink|e̞}}, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o̞}}, {{IPAslink|u}}}}). Phonetic nasalization occurs in Spanish for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal consonant ({{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}), but it is not distinctive as in Portuguese. Dialectally, there are Spanish dialects with a greater number of vowels, with some (as Murcian and Eastern Andalusian) reaching up to 8 to 10 vowel sounds. On the other hand, Portuguese has seven to nine oral vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ä|a}}, {{IPAslink|ɐ}}*, {{IPAslink|e}}, {{IPAslink|ɛ}}, {{IPAslink|ɯ|ɨ}}*, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o}}, {{IPAslink|ɔ}}, {{IPAslink|u}}}}) ({{IPA|/ɐ/}} is closer to {{IPAblink|ə}} in Portugal, while the [[close back unrounded vowel|near-close near-back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}}—also rendered as {{IPAblink|ɯ|ɯ̟}} or {{IPAblink|ʊ|ʊ̜}}—is only found in European Portuguese) plus five phonemic nasal vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ɐ̃}}, {{IPAslink|ẽ}}, {{IPAslink|ĩ}}, {{IPAslink|õ}}, {{IPAslink|ũ}}}}) when preceding an omitted syllable-final nasal ({{IPA|⟨n⟩}} and {{IPA|⟨m⟩}}) or when is marked with a [[tilde]] (~): ⟨ã⟩ and ⟨õ⟩. This appears to be, similarly to French, a Celtic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=nasal+portuguese+celtic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rnPk6q2_pK&amp;sig=got6sv4vtMj0YVD7BagpBDC8O54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlws3zpPXUAhVGCMAKHR8OB4AQ6AEIRTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=nasal+portuguese+celtic&amp;f=false|title=The Romance Languages|first=Rebecca|last=Posner|date=5 September 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; phonological adaptation to Latin. Portuguese, as Catalan, uses vowel height, contrasting stressed and unstressed (reduced) vowels. Moreover, Spanish has two semivowels as allophones, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|j}}, {{IPA link|w}}]}}; while Portuguese has four, two oral {{IPA|[{{IPA link|j|i̯}} ~ {{IPA link|ɪ|ɪ̯}}], [{{IPA link|w|u̯}} ~ {{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̯}}]}} and two nasalized glides {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ȷ̃|j̃}} ~ ɪ̯̃], [{{IPA link|w̃}} ~ ʊ̯̃]}} (non-syllabic near-close vowels, as those of most English speech, are allophones of the glides in the Brazilian dialects where near-closeds are used).

The following considerations are based on a comparison of standard versions of Spanish and Portuguese. Apparent divergence of the information below from anyone's personal pronunciation may indicate one's idiolect (or dialect) diverges from the mentioned standards. Information on Portuguese phonology is adapted from Celso Pedro Luft ({{lang|pt|Novo Manual de Português}}, 1971), and information on Spanish phonology adapted from [[Manuel Seco]] ({{lang|es|Gramática Esencial del Español}}, 1994).

Comparing the phonemic inventory of the two languages, a noticeable divergence stands out. First, standard Portuguese has more phonemes than Spanish. Also, each language has phonemes that are not shared by the other.

===Early phonetic divergence===

====Vowels====
Spanish and Portuguese have been diverging for over a thousand years. One of the most noticeable early differences between them concerned the result of the stressed vowels of Latin:

|}
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɐ/}} occur largely in [[complementary distribution]]. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;This diphthong has been reduced to the monophthong {{IPA|/o/}} in many dialects of modern Portuguese.
&lt;/small&gt;

As [[vowel length]] ceased to be distinctive in the transition from Latin to [[Romance languages|Romance]], the stressed vowels {{sm|e}} and {{sm|o}} became ''ie'' and ''ue'' in Spanish whenever they were short (Latin {{sm|petra}} → Spanish ''piedra'' 'stone'; Latin {{sm|moritvr}} → Spanish ''muere'' "he dies"). Similar [[diphthong]]izations can be found in other Romance languages ([[French language|French]] ''pierre'', Italian ''pietra'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''piatră''; French ''meurt'', Italian ''muore'', Romanian ''moare''), but in [[Galician-Portuguese]] these vowels underwent a qualitative change instead (Portuguese/Galician ''pedra'', ''morre''), becoming [[vowel height|lower]], as also happened with short {{sm|i}} and short {{sm|u}} in stressed syllables. The Classical Latin vowels {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/oː/}} were correspondingly lowered in Spanish and turned into diphthongs {{IPA|/je̞/}} and {{IPA|/we̞/}}. In Spanish, short {{sm|e}} and {{sm|o}} and long {{sm|ē}} and {{sm|ō}} merged into [[mid vowel]]s, {{IPA|/e̞/}} and {{IPA|/o̞/}}, while in Portuguese these vowels stayed as [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]], {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and [[open-mid]], {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, as in Vulgar Latin.

Portuguese has five phonemic [[nasal vowel]]s ({{IPA|/ɐ̃/, /ẽ/, /ĩ/, /õ/, /ũ/}}), which, according to historical linguistics, arose from the [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the nasal consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, often at the [[syllable coda|end of syllables]]. Syllable-final ''m'' and ''n'' are still written down to indicate nasalization, even though they are no longer fully pronounced, that is, either {{IPA|[ⁿ]}} (before [[obstruent]]s) or elided completely. In other cases, nasal vowels are marked with a [[tilde]] (''ã'', ''õ'').  Not all words containing ''vowel + n'' have the nasal sound, as the subsequent letter must be a consonant for this to occur: e.g., ''anel'' {{IPA|/ɐˈnɛw/}} ('ring') –oral/non-nasal– vs  ''anca'' {{IPA|/ˈɐ̃kɐ/}} ('hip') –nasal–.

However, in some Brazilian dialects, most vowels (including the allophones present only in unstressed environment) have nasal allophones before one of the nasal consonants {{IPA|/m/, /n/, /ɲ/}}, followed by another vowel. In other Brazilian dialects, only stressed vowels can be nasalized this way. In European Portuguese, nasalization is absent in this environment.

The Portuguese [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ou'' (pronounced usually as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[ow]}}, but sometimes as a [[monophthong]] {{IPA|[o]}}) corresponds to the final ''-ó'' of Spanish ''-ar'' verbs in the [[preterite]] tense; e.g., Spanish ''descansó'' and Portuguese ''descansou'' ("he/she rested"). The Spanish irregular verb forms in ''-oy'' (e.g., ''doy'' "I give", ''estoy'' "I am", ''soy'' "I am", ''voy'' "I go") correspond to Portuguese forms in ''-ou'' (e.g., ''dou'', ''estou'', ''sou'', ''vou''). But in some other words, conversely, Spanish ''o'' corresponds to Portuguese ''oi'', e.g., Spanish ''cosa'', Portuguese ''coisa'' "thing"; Spanish ''oro'' "gold", Portuguese usually ''ouro'', but sometimes ''oiro''.

Stressed vowel alternations may occur in Portuguese, but not in Spanish:

=====Unstressed vowels=====
The history of the unstressed vowels in Spanish and Portuguese is not as well known as that of the stressed vowels, but some points are generally agreed upon. Spanish has the five short vowels of classical Latin, {{IPA|/a/, /e̞/, /i/, /o̞/, /u/}}. It has also two semivowels, {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, that appear in diphthongs, but these can be considered allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, respectively. The pronunciation of the unstressed vowels does not differ much from that of stressed vowels. Unstressed, non-syllabic {{IPA|/e̞/}} {{IPA|/o̞/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, {{IPA|[w̝]}} and complete elision in some dialects; e.g., ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw̝e̞ˈtisa]}} ('poet' [[grammatical gender|f.]]), ''línea'' {{IPA|[ˈlinʝa]}} ('line'), ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[o̞ˈɾita]}} ('now').

The system of seven oral vowels of Vulgar Latin has been fairly well preserved in Portuguese, as in the closely related [[Galician language]]. In Portuguese, unstressed vowels have been more unstable, both diachronically (across time) and synchronically (between dialects), producing new vowel sounds. The vowels written ⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩ and ⟨o⟩ are pronounced in different ways according to several factors, most notably whether they are stressed, and whether they occur in the last syllable of a word. The basic paradigm is shown in the following table (it has some exceptions).

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Always nasalized in this environment in most dialects, that is, {{IPA|[ɐ̃ ~ ə̃]}}

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Mostly in Northeastern Brazil. In some other dialects (including those of northern Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and the Brazilian Federal District), this also occurs if the stressed vowel is open rather than closed ({{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, rather than {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/o/}}) due to [[vowel harmony]].

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Only in some dialects, the first mainly in the area including and surrounding Lisbon (not present in much of northern and insular Portugal, as in Brazil), and the latter mainly in some hinterland northern Portuguese accents (not present in southern and insular Portugal, as in Brazil)

Brazilian unstressed vowel allophones vary according to the geographical [[Regions of Brazil|region]] of the country. [[Near-close vowel|Near-close]] {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and unstressed [[Close-mid vowel|close-mid]] {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} are found in southern and western accents, where postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} has a "soft" allophone (a flap, a coronal approximant, or a rhotic vowel), and postvocalic sibilants (written ⟨s⟩, ⟨x⟩, and ⟨z⟩) in native words are ''always'' alveolar {{IPA|[s, z]}}. Meanwhile, these close allophones do not occur in the northern and eastern accents, where postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} has a "hard" allophone (velar, uvular, or glottal) and postvocalic sibilants ''may be'', consistently or not, post-alveolar {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ, ɕ, ʑ]}}. In the accents where postvocalic sibilants are ''always'' post-alveolar, such as those of Florianópolis and Rio de Janeiro, or in the accents influenced by them, ''any'' unstressed {{IPA|/a ~ ɐ/}}, {{IPA|[e̞ ~ ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o̞ ~ ɔ]}} may be raised (like in Portugal), to {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}, respectively. While this is true of all colloquial BP, it is especially characteristic of the latter dialects). This increased vowel reduction is also present in accents of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Brazilian Northeast]], particularly from Alagoas to Piauí.

Similar [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] patterns to these exist in other Romance languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan]]. Although it is mostly an allophonic variation, some dialects have developed minimal pairs that distinguish the stressed variants from the unstressed ones. The vowel {{IPAslink|ɯ|ɨ}} is often elided in connected speech (it is not present in Brazilian Portuguese).

Some Brazilian dialects diphthongize stressed vowels to {{IPA|[ai̯], [ɛi̯], [ei̯]}}, etc. (except {{IPA|/i/}}), before a sibilant at the end of a syllable (written ⟨s⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨z⟩, or rarely, ⟨sh⟩). For instance, ''Jesus'' {{IPA|[ʒe̞ˈzui̯s]}} 'Jesus', ''faz'' {{IPA|[ˈfai̯s]}} 'he does', ''dez'' {{IPA|[ˈdɛi̯s]}} 'ten'. This has led to the use of ''meia'' (meaning ''meia dúzia'', 'half a dozen') for ''seis'' {{IPA|[sei̯s]}} 'six' when making enumerations, to avoid any confusion with'' três'' {{IPA|[tɾei̯s]}} 'three' on the telephone. In [[Lisbon]] and surrounding areas, stressed {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}} or {{IPA|[ɐj]}} when it comes before an alveolo-palatal {{IPA|/ʎ/, /ɲ/, [ɕ], [ʑ]}} or palato-alveolar {{IPA|/ʃ/, /ʒ/}} consonants followed by another vowel.

The orthography of Portuguese, which is partly etymological and analogical, does not indicate these sound changes. This makes the written language look deceptively similar to Spanish. For example, although ''breve'' ('brief') is spelled the same in both languages, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbɾe̞βe̞]}} in Spanish, but {{IPA|[ˈbɾɛvi ~ ˈbɾɛv(ɨ)]}} in Portuguese. In Brazilian Portuguese, in the vast majority of cases, the only difference between final -''e'' and -''i'' is the stress, as both are pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}}. The former is unstressed, and the latter is stressed without any diacritical mark. In European Portuguese, final ''-e'' is [[Elision|not pronounced]] or is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɯ̽|ɨ}}, unlike ''i'', which is consistently {{IPA|[i]}}.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;reconstructed&lt;/small&gt;

Peculiar to early Spanish (as in the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] dialect of Occitan, possibly due to a [[Basque language|Basque]] substratum) was the loss of Latin initial {{sm|f}}- whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. Thus, Spanish ''hijo'' and ''hablar'' correspond to Portuguese ''filho'' and ''falar'' (from Latin {{sm|fīlium}} and {{sm|fābulāre}}, 'son' and 'to speak' respectively). Nevertheless, Portuguese ''fogo'' corresponds to Spanish ''fuego'' (from Latin {{sm|focum}} 'fire').

Another typical difference concerned the result of Latin -{{sm|l}}- and -{{sm|n}}- in [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] position:

* When single, they were retained in Spanish but [[elision|elided]] in Portuguese. Often, the loss of the consonant was followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels (as in the examples in the table above), or by the insertion of an [[epenthetic vowel]] between them (Latin {{sm|harēnam}} → Spanish ''arena'', Portuguese ''arẽa'', today ''areia'' 'sand').
* When [[Consonant length|double]], they developed into the Spanish palatals ⟨ll⟩ {{IPAslink|ʎ}} (merged with {{IPAslink|ʝ}} in most contemporary Spanish dialects) and ⟨ñ⟩ {{IPAslink|ɲ}}. Indeed, the Spanish [[ñ|letter ⟨ñ⟩]] was originally a shorthand for {{sm|nn}}. In Portuguese, -{{sm|ll}}- and -{{sm|nn}}- just became single, ⟨l⟩ {{IPAslink|l}} and ⟨n⟩ {{IPAslink|n}}, respectively.
* When followed by the [[semivowel]] {{sm|i}}, {{sm|l}} coalesced with it into a ⟨j⟩ {{IPAslink|x}} in Spanish. In Portuguese, {{sm|l}} and {{sm|n}} followed by semivowel {{sm|i}} were [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] into ⟨lh⟩ {{IPAslink|ʎ}} and ⟨nh⟩ {{IPAslink|ɲ}}, respectively.

Other [[consonant cluster]]s of Latin also took markedly different routes in the two languages in their archaic period:

|}

Learned words such as ''pleno, ocular, no(c)turno, tremular'', and so on, were not included in the examples above, since they were adapted directly from [[Classical Latin]] in later times.

The tables above represent only general trends with many exceptions, due to:
# Other phonological processes at work in old Spanish and old Portuguese, which interfered with these.
# Later [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] by analogy with related words.
# Later borrowing of [[Latinism|learned word]]s directly from Latin, especially since the Renaissance, which did not respect the original sound laws.
# Mutual borrowing, from Spanish to Portuguese or vice versa.

====Synaeresis====
Portuguese has tended to eliminate [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatuses]] that were preserved in Spanish, merging similar consecutive vowels into one (often after the above-mentioned loss of intervocalic -{{sm|l}}- and -{{sm|n}}-). This results in many Portuguese words being one syllable shorter than their Spanish cognates:

:''creído'', ''leer'', ''mala'', ''manzana'', ''mañana'', ''poner'', ''reír'', ''venir'' (Spanish)
:''crido'', ''ler'', ''má'', ''maçã'', ''manhã'', ''pôr'', ''rir'', ''vir'' (Portuguese)

In other cases, Portuguese reduces consecutive vowels to a diphthong, again resulting in one syllable fewer:

:''a-te-o'', ''eu-ro-pe-o'', ''pa-lo'', ''ve-lo'' (Spanish)
:''a-teu'', ''eu-ro-peu'', ''pau'', ''véu'' (Portuguese)

There are nevertheless a few words where the opposite happened, such as Spanish ''comprender'' versus Portuguese ''compreender'', from Latin {{sm|comprehendere}}.

===Different sounds with the same spelling===
Since the late Middle Ages, both languages have gone through sound shifts and mergers that set them further apart.

====Sibilants====
The most marked phonetic divergence between Spanish and Portuguese in their modern period concerned the evolution of the [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]s. In the Middle Ages, both had a rich system of seven sibilants – paired according to affrication and voicing: {{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|ts}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, {{IPAslink|dz}}, {{IPAslink|ʃ}}, {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, and {{IPAslink|dʒ}} (the latter probably in [[free variation]] with {{IPAslink|ʒ}}, as still happens today in [[Ladino language|Ladino]]) – and spelled virtually the same in Spanish and Portuguese.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Before vowels; in the coda position, there are dialectal variations within each language, not discussed here.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Modern Portuguese has for the most part kept the medieval spelling.&lt;/small&gt;

After the Renaissance, the two languages reduced their inventory of sibilants, but in different ways:

* Devoicing in Spanish: the [[voiced consonant|voiced]] sibilants written ⟨-s-⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨j/g⟩ became voiceless, merging with ⟨s-/-ss-⟩, ⟨c/ç⟩ and ⟨x⟩, respectively. In many modern Spanish dialects, ⟨c/z⟩ ({{IPA|/θ/}}) is also indistinguishable from ⟨s⟩ ({{IPA|/s/}}) (see ''[[seseo]]''). Later, the [[voiceless palato-alveolar fricative|palato-alveolar fricative]] ⟨x⟩ {{IPAslink|ʃ}} changed into the [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPAslink|x}}, while ⟨ch⟩ stay unchanged {{IPAslink|tʃ}}. Spanish spelling has been updated according to these sound changes.
* Deaffrication in Portuguese: the [[affricate consonant|affricates]] written ⟨c/ç⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨ch⟩ became plain fricatives, merging with the sibilants ⟨s-/-ss-⟩, ⟨-s-⟩ and ⟨x⟩ in most dialects, respectively. In spite of this, modern Portuguese has for the most part kept the medieval spelling.
* Deaffrication in Portuguese: some rural hinterland northern Portuguese dialects as well the [[Mirandese language]] preserved the medieval distinction, still indicated by the spelling, with the former affricates being voiceless [[Laminal consonant|laminal]], voiced laminal and still voiceless post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, respectively, and the sibilants being voiceless [[Apical consonant|apical]], voiced apical and voiceless palato-alveolar. As much of Brazilian Portuguese, these dialects have alveolar coda sibilants, though a [[voiceless apico-alveolar fricative]] has a hushing-like sound, more similar to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

In Spanish, ''r-'' and ''-rr-'' have kept their original pronunciation as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPAblink|r}}.

|}

Since no distinction is made anymore between the pronunciation of ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩, Spanish spelling has been reformed according to Classical Latin. In Portuguese, the spelling of these letters is based on pronunciation, which is closer to Latin and modern Italian. This leads to some orthographic disparities:

* Compare for example Spanish ''gobierno'', ''haber'', ''libro'' with Portuguese ''governo'', ''haver'', ''livro''.
* The endings of the imperfect indicative tense of 1st. conjugation verbs (with infinitives ending in ''-ar'') are spelled with ⟨b⟩ in Spanish (''cantaba'', ''cantabas'', ''cantábamos'', and so on), but with ⟨v⟩ in Portuguese (''cantava'', ''cantavas'', ''cantávamos'', etc.)
* The Spanish adjectival suffix ''-ble'', as in ''posible'' (also used in English, "possible"), corresponds to ''-vel'' in Portuguese: ''possível''.

In Spanish, the plosives ''b'', ''d'', ''g'' are [[lenition|lenited]], usually realized as "soft" [[approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|[β̞, ð̞, ɣ̞]}} (here represented without the undertracks) after [[continuant]]s. While similar pronunciations can be heard in [[European Portuguese]], most speakers of [[Brazilian Portuguese]] pronounce these phonemes consistently as "hard" [[plosives]] {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}}. This can make a Portuguese phrase such as ''uma bala'' ("a bullet") sound like ''una pala'' ("a shovel") to a Spanish-speaker.

The '''''Conversations-Lexikon mit vorzüglicher Rücksicht auf die gegenwärtigen Zeiten'''''&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Encyclopaedia |volume=9 |page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|Encyclopaedia with Special Regard to the Present Times}}), was a [[German language]] [[encyclopedia]] published in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] between 1796 and 1808.

The encyclopedia was published in 8 volumes and 2,762 pages. It was edited by Dr [[Renatus Gotthelf Löbel]], who intended to supersede [[Johann Hübner]] by including geography, history, biography, mythology, philosophy, natural history, and other topics.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Volumes i-iv (A to R) appeared between 1796 and 1800, with vol. v appearing in 1806.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This work was acquired and completed by [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]] in 1808 and formed the basis of the many editions of the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Brockhaus Encyclopedia]]'', which continued publication until 1 February 2014.

'''Copyright''' is a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]], existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.{{Citation needed|reason=1.

The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]] law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright on ideas is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.{{Citation needed|reason=ref 1 is written by one US lawyer. describing US situation only, specialised in software and IT, working for Fortune Top 100 companies: no NPOV; ref 2 is written by US Professor, describing US situation only, and only referring to digital information, not broad enough|date=June 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/unprotected.html#ideas|title=Works Unprotected by Copyright Law|publisher=Bitlaw|author=Daniel A.

Copyright is applicable to certain forms of creative work. Some, but not all jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.{{Citation needed|reason=ref 1 describes US situation only; ref 2 links not to any content relevant to this article; ref 3. is only related to sports, not suitable to use for a general article: ref 4. is a standarised form with an agreement written for US jurisdiction, not suitable as reference |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Copyright|publisher=University of California|year=2014|url=http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetlaw.org/publish/journal-conventions/|title=Journal Conventions - Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment &amp; Technology Law|website=www.jetlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=kz1F6uAHtaEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIHDAA&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Sports Marketing Agreements: Legal, Fiscal and Practical Aspects|first=Ian S.|last=Blackshaw|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xD_iBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT465&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIKDAC&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Publishing Forms and Contracts|first=Roy|last=Kaufman|date=16 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights frequently include reproduction, control over [[derivative work]]s, distribution, [[Performing rights|public performance]], and [[moral rights]] such as attribution.{{Citation needed|reason=ref refers to Section 106 of the Copyright Law of the United States, not suitable as source for general article on copyright |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=17 U.S.C. § 106|publisher=United States of America|year=2011|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="International Copyright Law Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcopyrightlaw.com/copyrightsurvey|title=International Copyright Law Survey|publisher=Mincov Law Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the public law [[Copyright term|duration of a copyright]] expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain [[copyright formalities]] to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] matter, though some jurisdictions do apply [[criminal law|criminal]] sanctions.

Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing "fair" exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to the philosophical basis of copyright law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright, such as those in the music business, have advocated the extension and expansion of copyright and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8472957/bmg-reports-3-percent-revenue-bump-during-first-half-of-2018 |title=BMG Reports Revenue Bump During First Half of 2018 |last=Spahr |first=Wolfgang |date=2018-08-30 |website=Billboard |language=en |access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Copyright licenses can also be granted by those deputized by the original claimant, and private companies may request this as a condition of doing business with them. Services of internet platform providers like YouTube, Facebook, GitHub, Hotmail, DropBox, Instagram, WhatsApp or Twitter only can be used when users grant the platform provider beforehand the right to co-use all uploaded content, including all material exchanged per email, chat or cloud-storage. These copyrights only apply for the firm that operates such a platform, no matter in what jurisdiction the platform-services are being offered. Private companies in general do not recognize exceptions or give users more rights than the right to use the platform according certain rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/10/new-site-grades-those-pesky-terms-of-service-agreements-you-never-read/|title=Those Pesky "Terms of Service" Agreements you never read|publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=24 June 2018 |quote=Facebook — yet to be graded by the new site — has grown notorious over the years for fiddling with its terms of service and privacy policies.

==History==
{{main|History of copyright law}}

===Background===
Copyright came about with the invention of [[Printing press|the printing press]] and with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century. The English [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was concerned about the unregulated [[copying]] of books and passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.

Copyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&amp;nbsp;se.&lt;ref&gt;Bettig, Ronald V. (1996). ''Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property. Westview Press''. p. 9–17. {{ISBN|0-8133-1385-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], films, photographs, software, and architectural works.

===National copyrights===
{{See also|Statute of Anne|History of US Copyright Law}}
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Statute of Anne]] (the Copyright Act 1709) came into force in 1710.]]
Often seen as the first real copyright law, the 1709 British [[Statute of Anne]] gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.&lt;ref name="Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |page=13 |author=Ronan, Deazley |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The act also alluded to individual rights of the artist. It began, "Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing&amp;nbsp;... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors&amp;nbsp;... to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html |title=Statute of Anne |publisher=Copyrighthistory.com |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.

The [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.

The original length of copyright in the United States was 14&amp;nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the [[public domain]], so it could be used and built upon by others.

Copyright law was enacted rather [[Copyright in Germany|late in German states]], and the historian Eckhard Höffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.&lt;ref name="thad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html | author=Frank Thadeusz |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date= 18 August 2010 |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International copyright treaties===
{{See also|International copyright agreements|List of parties to international copyright agreements}}
[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|'' The Pirate Publisher—An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886, satirizes the then-existing situation where a publisher could profit by simply stealing newly published works from one country, and publishing them in another, and vice versa.]]
The 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5 |accessdate=18 November 2011 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100&amp;nbsp;years later with the passage of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkle, Ann M; Fries, Janet; Lopez, Daniel; Possessky, Laura (1997). "Art conservation and the legal obligation to preserve artistic intent". [[JAIC]] 36 (2): 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and most [[Latin America]]n countries instead entered into the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] in 1910, which required a copyright notice on the work (such as ''[[all rights reserved]]''), and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf "International Copyright Relations of the United States"], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Copyright Office Circular No.&amp;nbsp;38a, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Parties to the Geneva Act of the Universal Copyright Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }} as of 1 January 2000: the dates given in the document are dates of ratification, not dates of coming into force. The Geneva Act came into force on 16 September 1955, for the first twelve to have ratified (which included four non-members of the Berne Union as required by Art.&amp;nbsp;9.1), or three months after ratification for other countries. {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.ht/en 165&amp;nbsp;Parties to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306215357/http://copyright.ht/en |date=6 March 2016 }} as of May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the [[Soviet Union]] and developing nations.

The regulations of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] are incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC |page=39 |author1=MacQueen, Hector L |author2=Charlotte Waelde |author3=Graeme T Laurie |isbn=978-0-19-926339-4 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]] signed the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations]]. In 1996, this organization was succeeded by the founding of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], which launched the 1996 [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]] and the 2002 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]], which enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it. The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] includes [[Trans-Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Provisions|intellectual Property Provisions]] relating to copyright.

Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through these international conventions such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and [[Universal Copyright Convention]]. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and [[international organizations]] such as the [[European Union]] or [[World Trade Organization]] require their member states to comply with them.

==Obtaining protection==
===Ownership===
The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself if the work is a "[[work for hire]]".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 201(b); Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[English law]] the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a "Work for Hire". Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the [[author]].&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-ownership/|title=Copyright Ownership: Who Owns What? - Copyright Overview by Rich Stim - Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center|website=fairuse.stanford.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"/&gt; But when more than one person creates the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met.

===Eligible works===
Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Specifics vary by [[jurisdiction]], but these can include [[poem]]s, [[theses]], [[Copyright Protection for Fictional Characters|fictional characters]] [[drama|plays]] and other [[book|literary works]], [[film|motion pictures]], [[choreography]], [[music|musical compositions]], [[sound recording]]s, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[computer software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]], and [[industrial design]]s. Graphic [[designs]] and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;as_brr=3|page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4081 |format=PDF|last=World Intellectual Property Organization|title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=1 December 2017|page=8|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and copyright|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;as_brr=3|pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the copyright to a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating [[derivative work]]s based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] particular [[anthropomorphic]] mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"/&gt; Note additionally that Mickey Mouse is not copyrighted because characters cannot be copyrighted; rather, [[Steamboat Willie]] is copyrighted and Mickey Mouse, as a character in that copyrighted work, is afforded protection.

===Originality===
{{main|Threshold of originality}}
Typically, a work must meet [[Threshold of originality|minimal standards of originality]] in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some "skill, labour, and judgment" that has gone into it.&lt;ref&gt;''Express Newspaper Plc v News (UK) Plc'', F.S.R. 36 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.

Copyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.

===Registration===
{{main|Copyright registration}}
[[File:Fermat Last Theorem "proof" registered by Ukraine officials.jpg|thumb|right|A copyright certificate for proof of the [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of Ukraine.]]
In all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"/&gt; However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright|url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf|website=copyright.gov|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)

A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]]. It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the [[postmark]] to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "This technique has not been recognized by any United States court" is overbroad because not all such cases are reported, and it is impossible to know whether this is correct.--&gt; The United States Copyright Office says the technique is not a substitute for actual registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright in General (FAQ)|url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman|publisher=U.S Copyright Office|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique and notes that the technique (as well as commercial registries) does not constitute dispositive proof that the work is original or establish who created the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm "Copyright Registers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014901/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm |date=5 October 2013 }}, United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-about/c-auto.htm "Automatic right"], United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use." overstates the UK IPO position; the IPO does NOT recommend against the PMC approach.--&gt;

===Fixing===
The [[Berne Convention]] allows member countries to decide whether creative works must be "fixed" to enjoy copyright. Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: "It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form." Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be "fixed in a tangible medium of expression" to obtain copyright protection.&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"&gt;See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law'']. See also Tyler T. Ochoa, [http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol20/iss4/5 ''Copyright, Derivative Works and Fixation: Is Galoob a Mirage, or Does the Form(GEN) of the Alleged Derivative Work Matter?''], 20 {{smallcaps|Santa Clara High Tech.}} L.J. 991, 999–1002 (2003) ("Thus, both the text of the Act and its legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended that a derivative work does not need to be fixed in order to infringe."). The legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act says this difference was intended to address transitory works such as ballets, pantomimes, improvised performances, dumb shows, mime performances, and dancing.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be "perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be "expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance."&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

===Copyright notice===
{{main|Copyright notice}}
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|upright|A copyright symbol used in copyright notice]]
Before 1989, United States law required the use of a copyright notice, consisting of the [[copyright symbol]] (©, the letter '''C''' inside a circle), the abbreviation "Copr.", or the word "Copyright", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act of 1976, {{USPL|94|553}}, 90 Stat. 2541, § 401(a) (19 October 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), {{USPL|100|568}}, 102 Stat. 2853, 2857. One of the changes introduced by the BCIA was to section&amp;nbsp;401, which governs copyright notices on published copies, specifying that notices "may be placed on" such copies; prior to the BCIA, the statute read that notices "shall be placed on all" such copies. An analogous change was made in section&amp;nbsp;402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (℗, the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' indicating a "phonorecord". In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age.|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador|year=2014|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|location=New York City, New York, USA|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&amp;nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |title=U.S. Copyright Office – Information Circular |format=PDF |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit&amp;nbsp;– using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of "innocent infringement" being successful.&lt;ref&gt;[[17 U.S.C.]]{{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])

In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.

"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Astra|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|date=2014|publisher=Picador|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement===
{{main|Copyright infringement}}
For a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Improper use of materials outside of legislation is deemed "unauthorized edition", not copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1087/09531510125100313 | title = Piracy | journal = Learned Publishing | volume = 14 | pages = 67–70 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics regarding the effects of copyright infringement are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to determine whether there is a monetary loss for industries affected by copyright infringement by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, S. Piracy Losses "Billboard" 199(36)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports indicate that copyright infringement does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry, and can have a positive effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/mi/2011/2011-11-30.html |title=Urheberrechtsverletzungen im Internet: Der bestehende rechtliche Rahmen genügt |publisher=Ejpd.admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a 2014 university study concluded that free music content, accessed on YouTube, does not necessarily hurt sales, instead has the potential to increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing|ssrn=2425386|title=Video Killed the Radio Star? Online Music Videos and Digital Music Sales|ISSN=2042-2695|year=2014|authors=Tobias Kretschmer &amp; Christian Peukert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights granted==
===Exclusive rights===
Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright:
* protection of the work
* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.
* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)
* to import or export the work
* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)
* to perform or display the work publicly
* to sell or cede these rights to others
* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase "exclusive right" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a "negative right", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf "Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?"] Accessed 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] --&gt;
{{main|Copyright term|List of countries' copyright length}}
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (currently based on the date of creation or publication).]]
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA|last=Nimmer|first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2003|isbn=  978-90-411-8876-2|oclc=50606064|page=63|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].", ''[[Cornell University]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter B. Hirtle, "Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.

But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.

In 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and exceptions==
{{main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}

In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. US copyright does NOT cover names, title, short phrases or Listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover – such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.

There are some exceptions to what copyright will protect. Copyright will not protect:
* Names of products
* Names of businesses, organizations, or groups
* Pseudonyms of individuals
* Titles of works
* Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes, slogans, or short advertising expressions
* Listings of ingredients in recipes, labels, and formulas, though the directions can be copyrighted

===Idea–expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine===
{{main|Idea–expression divide}}

The idea–expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).

===The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights===

{{main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}
Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.

Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.

In ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.

In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.

===Fair use and fair dealing===
{{main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[Fair use|fair use doctrine]], codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:
# the purpose and character of one's use
# the nature of the copyrighted work
# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to “format shift” that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to “time shift” a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.

In the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.

:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''

:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''

Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"/&gt; An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.

The [[copyright directive]] allows EU member states to implement a set of exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:
*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,
*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial
*archival reproductions of broadcasts,
*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,
*for demonstration or repair of equipment,
*for non-commercial research or private study
*when used in [[parody]]

===Accessible copies===
It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 - U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp|title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force|publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.

A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.

Copyright may also be [[license]]d.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"/&gt; Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.

===Free licenses===
Copyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].

Founded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website|website=creativecommons.org|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt;

Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Opposition to copyright}}
Some sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].

The interests of big internet platform service providers like Google, Amazon, Facebook or Microsoft, partly depending on users uploading content for free to their servers, collide with those of original content creators and right holders, both big, like Sony, Getty Images, Warner Bros, Elsevier, Springer and small, like local bands, national newspapers and TV-channels. In Germany the national public organisation GEMA, that collects copyright fees for composers, copywriters and music-publishers, won a juridical fight with Google over payment for songs published on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/kultur/gema-gewinnt-gegen-youtube-2782939.html|title=Gema gewinnt gegen YouTube |publisher=Saechsische Zeitung |accessdate= 24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns are often couched in the language of [[Digital rights|digital rights, digital freedom]], [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship|publisher=European Digital Rights |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, a political party has been grown out of it, ''The Pirates''. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].

==Public domain==
{{main|Public domain}}
Copyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.

In [[electrical power generation]], the distinct ways of generating [[electricity]] incur significantly different costs. Calculations of these costs can be made at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid. The cost is typically given per [[kilowatt-hour]] or [[megawatt-hour]]. It includes the initial [[capital (finance)|capital]], [[Annual effective discount rate|discount rate]], as well as the costs of continuous [[operating costs|operation]], [[fuel]], and [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]]. This type of calculation assists policymakers, researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making.

The '''levelized cost of energy''' ('''LCOE''') is a measure of a power source that allows comparison of different methods of electricity generation on a consistent basis. It is an economic assessment of the [[average total cost]] to build and operate a power-generating asset over its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that lifetime. The LCOE can also be regarded as the average minimum price at which electricity must be sold in order to [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] over the lifetime of the project.

== Cost factors ==

While calculating costs, several internal cost factors have to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/publications/a-review-of-electricity-unit-cost-estimates.html A Review of Electricity Unit Cost Estimates]
Working Paper, December 2006 – Updated May 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108013039/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0706_TPA_A_Review_of_Electricity.pdf |date=January 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the use of "costs," which is not the actual selling price, since this can be affected by a variety of factors such as subsidies and taxes:

*[[Capital costs]] (including [[waste]] disposal and [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] costs for nuclear energy) – tend to be low for [[fossil fuel]] [[power station]]s; high for wind turbines, solar PV (photovoltaics); very high for [[waste to energy]], [[wave power|wave]] and [[Tidal power|tidal]], [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], and [[nuclear power|nuclear]].
*Fuel costs – high for fossil fuel and biomass sources, low for nuclear, and zero for many renewables. Fuel costs can vary somewhat unpredictably over the life of the generating equipment, due to political and other factors.
*Factors such as the costs of waste (and associated issues) and different insurance costs are not included in the following: Works power, own use or [[parasitic load]] – that is, the portion of generated power actually used to run the station's pumps and fans has to be allowed for.

To evaluate the total cost of production of electricity, the streams of costs are converted to a [[net present value]] using the [[time value of money]]. These costs are all brought together using [[discounted cash flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/killer-wind-graphs.html |title=Cost of wind, nuclear and gas powered generation in the UK |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-library/downloads/windenergy |title=David Millborrows paper on wind costs |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levelized cost of electricity ===

The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), also known as Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset. It is often taken as a proxy for the average price that the generating asset must receive in a market to break even over its lifetime. It is a first-order economic assessment of the cost competitiveness of an electricity-generating system that incorporates all costs over its lifetime: initial investment, operations and maintenance, cost of fuel, [[cost of capital]].

The levelized cost is that value for which an equal-valued fixed revenue delivered over the life of the asset's generating profile would cause the project to break even. This can be roughly calculated as the net present value of all costs over the lifetime of the asset divided by the total electrical energy output of the asset.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Energy Agency/International Energy Agency/Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [http://www.iea.org/Textbase/publications/free_new_Desc.asp?PUBS_ID=1472 Projected Costs of Generating Electricity (2005 Update)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LCOE} = \frac{\text{sum of costs over lifetime}}{\text{sum of electrical energy produced over lifetime}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{ I_t + M_t + F_t}{\left({1+r}\right)^t} }{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{E_t}{\left({1+r}\right)^{t}} }

For example, other versions of the above formula do not discount the electricity stream.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}|style=line-height: 110%; padding: 14px 0; width: 60%;}}

Typically the LCOE is calculated over the design lifetime of a plant, which is usually 20 to 40 years, and given in the units of currency per [[kilowatt-hour]] or megawatt-day, for example AUD/kWh or EUR/kWh or per [[megawatt-hour]], for example AUD/MWh (as tabulated below).&lt;ref&gt;K. Branker, M. J.M. Pathak, J. M. Pearce, {{doi|10.1016/j.rser.2011.07.104}} A Review of Solar Photovoltaic Levelized Cost of Electricity, ''[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]]'' 15, pp.4470–4482 (2011). [http://hdl.handle.net/1974/6879 Open access]&lt;/ref&gt; However, care should be taken in comparing different LCOE studies and the sources of the information as the LCOE for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions, financing terms and technological deployment analyzed.&lt;ref name="Branker"/&gt; In particular, assumption of [[capacity factor]] has significant impact on the calculation of LCOE. Thus, a key requirement for the analysis is a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions.&lt;ref name="Branker"/&gt;

Many scholars,{{specify|date=July 2015}} such as [[Paul Joskow]], have described limits to the "levelized cost of electricity" metric for comparing new generating sources. In particular, LCOE ignores time effects associated with matching production to demand. This happens at two levels:
* Dispatchability, the ability of a generating system to come online, go offline, or ramp up or down, quickly as demand swings.
* The extent to which the availability profile matches or conflicts with the market demand profile.
Thermally lethargic technologies like coal and nuclear are physically incapable of fast ramping. Capital intensive technologies such as wind, solar, and nuclear are economically disadvantaged unless generating at maximum availability since the LCOE is nearly all sunk-cost capital investment. [[Intermittent]] power sources, such as wind and solar, may incur extra costs associated with needing to have storage or backup generation available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/6317 Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity-Generating Technologies", by Paul Joskow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, intermittent sources can be competitive if they are available to produce when demand and prices are highest, such as solar during summertime mid-day peaks seen in hot countries where [[air conditioning]] is a major consumer.&lt;ref name="Branker" /&gt; Despite these time limitations, leveling costs is often a necessary prerequisite for making comparisons on an equal footing before demand profiles are considered, and the levelized-cost metric is widely used for comparing technologies at the margin, where grid implications of new generation can be neglected.

Another limitation of the LCOE metric is the influence of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[energy conservation|conservation]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="Bronski2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bronski |first1=Peter |title=You Down With LCOE? Maybe You, But Not Me:Leaving behind the limitations of levelized cost of energy for a better energy metric |url=http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2014_05_29_you_down_with_lcoe |website=RMI Outlet |publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) |accessdate=28 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6laUWWL2y?url=http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2014_05_29_you_down_with_lcoe |archivedate=28 October 2016 |date=29 May 2014 |quote=Desirable shifts in how we as a nation and as individual consumers—whether a residential home or commercial real estate property—manage, produce, and consume electricity can actually make LCOE numbers look worse, not better. This is particularly true when considering the influence of energy efficiency...If you’re planning a new, big central power plant, you want to get the best value (i.e., lowest LCOE) possible. For the cost of any given power-generating asset, that comes through maximizing the number of kWh it cranks out over its economic lifetime, which runs exactly counter to the highly cost-effective energy efficiency that has been a driving force behind the country’s flat and even declining electricity demand. On the flip side, planning new big, central power plants without taking continued energy efficiency gains (of which there’s no shortage of opportunity—the February 2014 UNEP Finance Initiative report Commercial Real Estate: Unlocking the energy efficiency retrofit investment opportunity identified a $231–$300 billion annual market by 2020) into account risks overestimating the number of kWh we’d need from them and thus lowballing their LCOE... If I’m a homeowner or business considering purchasing rooftop solar outright, do I care more about the per-unit value (LCOE) or my total out of pocket (lifetime system cost)?...The per-unit value is less important than the thing considered as a whole...LCOE, for example, fails to take into account the time of day during which an asset can produce power, where it can be installed on the grid, and its carbon intensity, among many other variables. That’s why, in addition to [levelized avoided cost of energy (LACE)], utilities and other electricity system stakeholders...have used benefit/cost calculations and/or an asset’s capacity value or contribution to peak on a system or circuit level. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
EEC has caused the electricity demand of many countries to remain flat or decline. Considering only the LCOE for utility scale plants will tend to maximise generation and risks overestimating required generation due to efficiency, thus "lowballing" their LCOE. For solar systems installed at the point of end use, it is more economical to invest in EEC first, then solar (resulting in a smaller required solar system than what would be needed without the EEC measures). However, designing a solar system on the basis of LCOE would cause the smaller system LCOE to increase (as the energy generation [measured in kWh] drops faster than the system cost [$]). The whole of system life cycle cost should be considered, not just the LCOE of the energy source.&lt;ref name="Bronski2014" /&gt; LCOE is not as relevant to end-users than other financial considerations such as income, cashflow, mortgage, leases, rent, and electricity bills.&lt;ref name="Bronski2014" /&gt; Comparing solar investments in relation to these can make it easier for end-users to make a decision, or using cost-benefit calculations "and/or an asset’s capacity value or contribution to peak on a system or circuit level".&lt;ref name="Bronski2014" /&gt;

=== Avoided cost ===

The US [[Energy Information Administration]] has recommended that levelized costs of non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] sources such as wind or solar may be better compared to the avoided energy cost rather than to the LCOE of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal. This is because introduction of fluctuating power sources may or may not avoid capital and maintenance costs of backup dispatchable sources. Levelized Avoided Cost of Energy (LACE) is the avoided costs from other sources divided by the annual yearly output of the non-dispatchable source. However, the avoided cost is much harder to calculate accurately.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf Levelized cost of new generation resources], 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – Source|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marginal cost of electricity ===

A more accurate economic assessment might be the [[marginal cost]] of electricity. This value works by comparing the added system cost of increasing electricity generation from one source versus that from other sources of electricity generation (see [[Merit Order]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== External costs of energy sources ===

{{see also|Environmental impact of the energy industry|Economics of new nuclear power plants}}
Typically pricing of electricity from various energy sources may not include all [[Externality|external costs]] – that is, the costs indirectly borne by society as a whole as a consequence of using that energy source.&lt;ref name=eu2012/&gt; These may include enabling costs, environmental impacts, usage lifespans, energy storage, recycling costs, or beyond-insurance accident effects.

The US Energy Information Administration predicts that [[Fossil fuel power station|coal and gas]] are set to be continually used to deliver the majority of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/electricity.cfm International Energy Outlook: Electricity] "Although coal-fired generation increases by an annual average of only 1.9 percent, it remains the largest source of electricity generation through 2035. In 2008, coal-fired generation accounted for 40 percent of world electricity supply; in 2035, its share decreases to 37 percent, as renewables, natural gas, and nuclear power all are expected to advance strongly during the projection and displace the need for coal-fired-generation in many parts of the world. World net coal-fired generation grows by 67 percent, from 7.7 trillion kilowatthours in 2008 to 12.9 trillion kilowatthours in 2035." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822160924/http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/electricity.cfm |date=August 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to result in the evacuation of millions of homes in low-lying areas, and an annual cost of hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2327795.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Business – The economic impact of global warming|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/27/rising-sea-levels-australia-beaches|title=Climate change threatens Australia's coastal lifestyle, report warns|first=Toni|last=O'Loughlin|date=27 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/02/030218085954.htm Tufts Civil Engineer Predicts Boston’s Rising Sea Levels Could Cause Billions Of Dollars In Damage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainability.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Kirshen.pdf Rising Sea Levels' cost on Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/saveenergyinyourhome.ppt|title=Tufts University slide 28, note projected Bangladesh evacuation|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/the-hidden-cost-of-fossil.html|title=The Hidden Costs of Fossil Fuels|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/risingsealevel_more.htm |title=Climate Change Effects – Rising Sea Level in depth |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921162339/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/risingsealevel_more.htm |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An EU funded research study known as ExternE, or [[Externality|Externalities]] of Energy, undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[chromium VI]], river water [[Alkali soils|alkalinity]], [[mercury poisoning]] and [[arsenic]] emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1%–2% of the [[Economy of the European Union|EU’s entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]], and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ier.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projektwebsites/newext/externen.pdf New research reveals the real costs of electricity in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/exterpols.html ExternE-Pol, External costs of current and advanced electricity systems, associated with emissions from the operation of power plants and with the rest of the energy chain, final technical report.] See figure 9, 9b and figure 11&lt;/ref&gt; Coal has the highest external cost in the EU, and global warming is the largest part of that cost.&lt;ref name=eu2012&gt;"[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/studies/doc/20141013_subsidies_costs_eu_energy.pdf Subsidies and costs of EU energy. Project number: DESNL14583]" Pages: 52. ''EcoFys'', 10 October 2014. Accessed: 20 October 2014. Size: 70 pages in 2MB.&lt;/ref&gt;

A means to address a part of the external costs of fossil fuel generation is [[carbon pricing]] — the method most favored by economics for reducing global-warming emissions. Carbon pricing charges those who emit carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for their emissions. That charge, called a 'carbon price', is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/annex1-ensglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: "Climate price", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon pricing usually takes the form of a [[carbon tax]] or a requirement to purchase permits to emit (also called "allowances").

Depending on the assumptions of possible accidents and their probabilites external costs for nuclear power vary significantly and can reach between 0.2 and 200 ct/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Wesselak, Thomas Schabbach, Thomas Link, Joachim Fischer: ''Regenerative Energietechnik''. Springer 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-642-24165-9}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, nuclear power is working under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the [[Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy|Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability]], the Brussels supplementary convention, and the [[Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage|Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage]. [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the U.S. the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price-Anderson Act]]. It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity; but the cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the levelized cost of electricity, according to a CBO study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity] [[Congressional Budget Office]], May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

These beyond-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as [[hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the [[Banqiao Dam]] disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large [[dam failure]]s in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf Availability of Dam Insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf |date=2016-01-08 }} 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Because externalities are diffuse in their effect, external costs can not be measured directly, but must be estimated. One approach estimate external costs of environmental impact of electricity is the Methodological Convention of Federal Environment Agency of Germany. That method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/publikation/long/4485.pdf ''Methodenkonvention 2.0 zur Schätzung von Umweltkosten B, Anhang B: Best-Practice-Kostensätze für Luftschadstoffe, Verkehr, Strom -und Wärmeerzeugung''] (PDF; 886&amp;nbsp;kB).

Oktober 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For nuclear the Federal Environment Agency indicates no value, as different studies have results that vary by a factor of 1,000. It recommends the nuclear given the huge uncertainty, with the cost of the next inferior energy source to evaluate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/uba_methodenkonvention_2.0_-_2012.pdf ''Ökonomische Bewertung von Umweltschäden METHODENKONVENTION 2.0 ZUR SCHÄTZUNG VON UMWELTKOSTEN''] (PDF; 799&amp;nbsp;kB), S. 27–29.

Oktober 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this recommendation the Federal Environment Agency, and with their own method, the Forum Ecological-social market economy, arrive at external environmental costs of nuclear energy at 10.7 to 34 ct/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foes.de/pdf/2012-09-Externe_Kosten_Atomenergie.pdf ''Externe Kosten der Atomenergie und Reformvorschläge zum Atomhaftungsrecht''] (PDF; 862&amp;nbsp;kB), 9/2012.

=== Additional cost factors ===

Calculations often do not include wider system costs associated with each type of plant, such as long distance transmission connections to grids, or balancing and reserve costs. Calculations do not include externalities such as health damage by coal plants, nor the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions on the [[climate change]], [[ocean acidification]] and [[eutrophication]], [[ocean current]] shifts. Decommissioning costs of nuclear plants are usually not included (The USA is an exception, because the cost of decommissioning is included in the price of electricity, per the [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]]), is therefore not [[full cost accounting]]. These types of items can be explicitly added as necessary depending on the purpose of the calculation. It has little relation to actual price of power, but assists policy makers and others to guide discussions and decision making.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

These are not minor factors but very significantly affect all responsible power decisions:
*[[Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions]] show coal, for instance, to be radically higher in terms of GHGs than any alternative. ''Accordingly, in the analysis below, [[carbon capture]]d coal is generally treated as a separate source rather than being averaged in with other coal.''
*Other [[environmental concerns with electricity generation]] include [[acid rain]], [[ocean acidification]] and effect of coal extraction on watersheds.
*Various human health concerns with electricity generation, including [[asthma]] and [[smog]], now dominate decisions in developed nations that incur health care costs publicly. A [[Harvard University]] Medical School study estimates the US health costs of coal alone at between 300 and 500 billion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.harvard.edu/news/general/new-harvard-study-examines-cost-coal |title=New Harvard Study Examines Cost of Coal |publisher=Environment.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*While [[Electric power transmission#Cost of electric power transmission|cost per kWh of transmission]] varies drastically with distance, the long complex projects required to clear or even upgrade transmission routes make even attractive new supplies often uncompetitive with conservation measures (see below), because the timing of payoff must take the transmission upgrade into account.

===Lazard (2018)===

In November, 2018, Lazard found that not only are utility-scale solar and wind cheaper than fossil fuels, "[i]n some scenarios, alternative energy costs have decreased to the point that they are now at or below the marginal cost of conventional generation." 
Overall, Lazard found "The low end levelized cost of onshore wind-generated energy is $29/MWh, compared to an average illustrative marginal cost of $36/MWh for coal. The levelized cost of utility-scale solar is nearly identical to the illustrative marginal cost of coal, at $36/MWh. This comparison is accentuated when subsidizing onshore wind and solar, which results in levelized costs of energy of $14/MWh and $32/MWh, respectively. ... The mean levelized cost of energy of utility-scale PV technologies is down approximately 13% from last year and the mean levelized cost of energy of onshore wind has declined almost 7%."&lt;ref name="Lazard2018"&gt;{{cite article |title=Levelized Cost of Energy and Levelized Cost of Storage 2018 |date=November 8, 2018 |url=https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2018/ |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg does not provide its global public LCOEs for fossil fuels, but it notes in India they are significantly more expensive: "BNEF is now showing benchmark LCOEs for onshore wind of just $39 per MWh, down 46% on a year ago, and for solar PV at $41, down 45%.

According to various studies, the cost for wind and solar has dramatically reduced since 2006. For example, the Australian [[Climate Council]] states that over the 5 years between 2009–2014 solar costs fell by 75% making them comparable to coal, and are expected to continue dropping over the next 5 years by another 45% from 2014 prices.&lt;ref name="CC2014"&gt;The Climate Council [http://www.climatecouncil.org.au/globalrenewablesreport The global renewable energy boom: how Australia is missing out], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that wind has been cheaper than coal since 2013, and that coal and gas will become less viable as subsidies are withdrawn and there is the expectation that they will eventually have to pay the costs of pollution.&lt;ref name="CC2014" /&gt;

A CO2CRC report, printed on the 27th of November 2015, titled [https://theconversation.com/wind-solar-coal-and-gas-to-reach-similar-costs-by-2030-report-51306 "Wind, solar, coal and gas to reach similar costs by 2030:"], provides the following updated situation in Australia. "The updated LCOE analysis finds that in 2015 natural gas combined cycle and supercritical pulverised coal (both black and brown) plants have the lowest LCOEs of the technologies covered in the study. Wind is the lowest cost large-scale renewable energy source, while rooftop solar panels are competitive with retail electricity prices. By 2030 the LCOE ranges of both conventional coal and gas technologies as well as wind and large-scale solar converge to a common range of A$50 to A$100 per megawatt hour."

An updated report, posted on the 27th of September 2017, titled "[https://theconversation.com/renewables-will-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-the-future-here-are-the-numbers-84433 Renewables will be cheaper than coal in the future. Here are the numbers]", indicated that a 100% renewables system is competitive with new-build supercritical (ultrasupercritical) coal, which, according to the Jacobs calculations in the report link above, would come in at around A$75(80) per MWh between 2020 and 2050. This projection for supercritical coal is consistent with other studies by the [http://www.co2crc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LCOE_Report_final_web.pdf CO2CRC in 2015] (A$80 per MWh) and used by [https://www.csiro.au/en/Do-business/Futures/Reports/Low-Emissions-Technology-Roadmap CSIRO in 2017] (A$65-80 per MWh).

{{Update|section|date=July 2015}}

The [[International Energy Agency]] and [[Électricité de France|EDF]] have estimated for 2011 the following costs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} For the nuclear power they include the costs due to new safety investments to upgrade the French nuclear plant after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]; the cost for those investments is estimated at 4 €/MWh. Concerning the solar power the estimate at 293 €/MWh is for a large plant capable to produce in the range of 50–100 GWh/year located in a favorable location (such as in Southern Europe). For a small household plant capable to produce typically around 3 MWh/year the cost is according to the location between 400 and 700 €/MWh. Currently solar power is by far the most expensive renewable source to produce electricity among the technologies studied,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} although increasing efficiency and longer lifespan of photovoltaic panels together with reduced production costs could make this source of energy more competitive. In 2017, cost of generation decrease to €55,5/MWh for plant between 5 and 17MWp.

{{update section|date=July 2016}}
A 2010 study by the Japanese government (pre-Fukushima disaster), called the Energy White Paper,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} concluded the cost for kilowatt hour was ¥49 for solar, ¥10 to ¥14 for wind, and ¥5 or ¥6 for nuclear power. [[Masayoshi Son]], an advocate for renewable energy, however, has pointed out that the government estimates for nuclear power did not include the costs for reprocessing the fuel or disaster insurance liability. Son estimated that if these costs were included, the cost of nuclear power was about the same as wind power.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110712i1.html Son's quest for sun, wind has nuclear interests wary]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 July 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Winifred, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110724x1.html Powering Japan's future]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 July 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110922x3.html Current nuclear debate to set nation's course for decades]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 September 2011, p. 1. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland commissioned a former Director of Operations of the British National Grid, Colin Gibson, to produce a report on generation levelised costs that for the first time would include some of the transmission costs as well as the generation costs. This was published in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesisenergy.org/lcost/LCost-Paper.pdf |title=Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution seeks to encourage debate of the issue, and has taken the unusual step among compilers of such studies of publishing a spreadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesisenergy.org/lcost/ |title=Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland data |publisher=Iesisenergy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Projected_LCOE_in_the_U.S._by_2020_(as_of_2015).png|thumb|640px|Projected LCOE in the U.S. by 2020 (as of 2015) in dollars per [[megawatt-hour|MWh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – Source|url = http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The following data are from the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook released in 2015 (AEO2015). They are in dollars per megawatt-hour (2013 USD/MWh). These figures are estimates for plants going into service in 2020.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"/&gt; The LCOE below is calculated based off a 30-year recovery period using a real after tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.1%. For carbon intensive technologies 3 percentage points are added to the WACC. (This is approximately equivalent fee of $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide {{CO2}})

Since 2010, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has published the [[Annual Energy Outlook]] (AEO), with yearly LCOE-projections for future utility-scale facilities to be commissioned in about five years' time. In 2015, EIA has been criticized by the [[Advanced Energy Economy]] (AEE) Institute after its release of the AEO 2015-report to "consistently underestimate the growth rate of renewable energy, leading to 'misperceptions' about the performance of these resources in the marketplace". AEE points out that the average [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA) for wind power was already at $24/MWh in 2013. Likewise, PPA for utility-scale [[solar PV]] are seen at current levels of $50–$75/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-report-renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency-will-grow-provide-options-for-clean-power-plan-compliance-based-on-cost-competitiveness-300102605.html |title=New Report: Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Will Grow, Provide Options for Clean Power Plan Compliance Based on Cost Competitiveness—Official Projections Fail to Capture Market Realities, Skewing Policy Considerations |work=PR newswire |date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures contrast strongly with EIA's estimated LCOE of $125/MWh (or $114/MWh including subsidies) for solar PV in 2020.&lt;ref name="eia-aeo-2015" /&gt;

The electricity sources which had the most decrease in estimated costs over the period 2010 to 2017 were solar photovoltaic (down 81%), onshore wind (down 63%) and advanced natural gas combined cycle (down 32%).

For utility-scale generation put into service in 2040, the EIA estimated in 2015 that there would be further reductions in the constant-dollar cost of concentrated solar power (CSP) (down 18%), solar photovoltaic (down 15%), offshore wind (down 11%), and advanced nuclear (down 7%). The cost of onshore wind was expected to rise slightly (up 2%) by 2040, while natural gas combined cycle electricity was expected to increase 9% to 10% over the period.&lt;ref name="eia-aeo-2015"&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo15/electricity_generation.cfm Levelized cost and levelized avoided cost of new generation resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2015], 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lazard (2015) ====
In November 2015, the investment bank [[Lazard]] headquartered in New York, published its ninth annual study on the current electricity production costs of photovoltaics in the US compared to conventional power generators. The best large-scale photovoltaic power plants can produce electricity at 50 USD per MWh. The upper limit at 60 USD per MWh. In comparison, coal-fired plants are between 65 USD and $150 per MWh, nuclear power at 97 USD per MWh. Small photovoltaic power plants on roofs of houses are still at 184–300 USD per MWh, but which can do without electricity transport costs. Onshore wind turbines are 32–77 USD per MWh. One drawback is the intermittency of solar and wind power. The study suggests a solution in [[Battery storage power station|batteries as a storage]], but these are still expensive so far.&lt;ref name="lazard1"&gt;[https://www.lazard.com/media/2390/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-analysis-90.pdf] November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecowatch.com/2014/09/23/solar-wind-renewables-outshine-fossil-fuels/ Solar and Wind Outshine Fossil Fuels] November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazard's long standing Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) report is widely considered and industry benchmark.  In 2015 Lazard published its inaugural Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) report, which was developed by the investment bank Lazard in collaboration with the energy consulting firm, Enovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lazard.com/media/438047/press-release-lcoe-lcos-2016.pdf|title=Lazard Press Release|last=|first=|date=2016-12-16|website=Lazard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazilian electricity mix: the Renewable and Non-renewable Exergetic Cost (2014) ====
[[File:Exergy costs of Integrated Brazilian Electricity Mix.tiff|thumb|500px|Exergy costs of Integrated Brazilian Electricity Mix]]
As long as exergy stands for the useful energy required for an economic activity to be accomplished, it is reasonable to evaluate the cost of the energy on the basis of its exergy content. Besides, as exergy can be considered as measure of the departure of the environmental conditions, it also serves as an indicator of environmental impact, taking into account both the efficiency of supply chain (from primary exergy inputs) and the efficiency of the production processes. In this way, [[exergoeconomy]] can be used to rationally distribute the exergy costs and {{CO2}} emission cost among the products and by-products of a highly integrated Brazilian electricity mix. Based on the [[thermoeconomy]] methodologies, some authors&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890414003628 | doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2014.04.058 | volume=85 | title=Renewable and non-renewable exergy cost and specific {{CO2}} emission of electricity generation: The Brazilian case | journal=Energy Conversion and Management | pages=619–629}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that exergoeconomy provides an opportunity to quantify the renewable and non-renewable specific exergy consumption; to properly allocate the associated {{CO2}} emissions among the streams of a given production route; as well as to determine the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the production processes. Accordingly, the non-renewable unit exergy cost (cNR) [kJ/kJ] is defined as the rate of non-renewable exergy necessary to produce one unit of exergy rate/flow rate of a substance, fuel, electricity, work or heat flow, whereas the Total Unit Exergy Cost (cT) includes the Renewable (cR) and Non-Renewable Unit Exergy Costs. Analogously, the {{CO2}} emission cost (c{{CO2}}) [g{{CO2}}/kJ] is defined as the rate of {{CO2}} emitted to obtain one unit of exergy rate/flow rate.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

[[File:Price history of silicon PV cells since 1977.svg|thumb|Price history of silicon PV cells since 1977]]

Photovoltaic prices have fallen from $76.67 per watt in 1977 to nearly $0.23 per watt in August 2017, for [[crystalline silicon]] [[solar cell]]s.&lt;ref name="energytrend-pv-spotprice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Price Quotes |url=http://pv.energytrend.com/pricequotes.html |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/21566414-alternative-energy-will-no-longer-be-alternative-sunny-uplands| title =Sunny Uplands: Alternative energy will no longer be alternative| publisher=The Economist| accessdate = 2012-12-28| date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as evidence supporting [[Swanson's law]], which states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of cumulative shipments. The famous [[Moore's law]] calls for a doubling of transistor count every two years.

By 2011, the price of PV modules per MW had fallen by 60% since 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in some sunny countries; an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75% from 2007 to 2012 has also been published,&lt;ref name=wells2012&gt;{{Citation

With a carbon price of $50/ton (which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh), solar PV is cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling a worldwide cumulative capacity of 297 GW by end 2016. According to some estimates total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.&lt;ref name=natint&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-end-the-nuclear-renaissance-6325?page=1 |title=The End of the Nuclear Renaissance &amp;#124;

In the case of self consumption, payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid. Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies, but higher costs. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. Inverter technology is rapidly improving and current equipment has reached 99% efficiency for small scale residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.pv-tech.org/news/solaredge-sales-slow-on-us-residential-market-sluggishness |title= SolarEdge sales slow on US residential market sluggishness |website= pv-tech.org |first= Mark |last= Osborne |date= 2016-11-10 |accessdate= 2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while commercial scale three-phase equipment can reach well above 98% efficiency. However, an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057.13 to $8,213.64 (analysis from 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163522/http://www.verdel3c.com/blog/converting-solar-energy-phev-battery/ Converting Solar Energy into the PHEV Battery] "VerdeL3C.com", May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to combine solar PV with other technologies to make hybrid systems, which enable more stand alone systems. The calculation of LCOEs becomes more complex, but can be done by aggregating the costs and the energy produced by each component. As for example, PV and [[cogen]] and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mundada | first1 = Aishwarya | last2 = Shah | first2 = Kunal | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2016 | title = Levelized cost of electricity for solar photovoltaic, battery and cogen hybrid systems | url = https://www.academia.edu/20141118/Levelized_cost_of_electricity_for_solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_cogen_hybrid_systems | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 692–703 | doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.084}}&lt;/ref&gt; while reducing energy- and electricity-related [[greenhouse gas emissions]] as compared to conventional sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = Kunal K. | last2 = Mundada | first2 = Aishwarya S. | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2015 | title = Performance of U.S. hybrid distributed energy systems: Solar photovoltaic, battery and combined heat and power | url = https://www.academia.edu/14674492/Performance_of_U.S._hybrid_distributed_energy_systems_Solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_combined_heat_and_power | journal = Energy Conversion and Management | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 71–80 | doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2015.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a solar thermal storage plant is forced to idle due to lack of sunlight locally during cloudy days, it is possible to consume the cheap excess infirm power from solar PV, wind and hydro power plants (similar to a lesser efficient, huge capacity and low cost battery storage system) by heating the hot molten salt to higher temperature for converting the stored thermal energy in to electricity during the peak demand hours when the electricity sale price is profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/06/salt-silicon-or-graphite-energy-storage-goes-beyond-lithium-ion-batteries|title=Salt, silicon or graphite: energy storage goes beyond lithium ion batteries  |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-110/features/thermal-renewable-energy/commercializing-standalone-thermal-energy-storage.html|title=Commercializing Standalone Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated, "Wind's costs have dropped over the past two years, in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently.... about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electricity, and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year.... winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street's banks.... Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles.... 5,600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States, more than double the number at this point in 2010. 35% of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind, more than new gas and coal plants combined, as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves."&lt;ref name=salerno&gt;Salerno, E., AWEA Director of Industry and Data Analysis, as quoted in Shahan, Z.

This opened up new opportunities in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. The price of power from wind turbines built {{convert|300|to|400|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry’s New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:伏見稲荷５.JPG|thumb|250px|Altar to [[Inari Ōkami]] at the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Shrine]] in [[Kyoto]]. [[Shinto]] is the ethnic religion of the [[Japanese people]].]]

In [[religious studies]], an '''ethnic religion''' (or '''indigenous religion''') is a [[religion]] associated with a particular [[ethnic group]]. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from [[universalizing religion|universal religions]] which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic religions are not only independent religions. Some localised denominations of global religions are practised solely by certain ethnic groups. For example, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

== Terminology ==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of "ethnic" or "indigenous" religions.

The term "primal religion" was coined by [[Andrew Walls]] in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=1 March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "primal religion," "primitive religion," and "tribal religion" have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity. Cox prefers to use the term "indigenous religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Primitive to Indigenous: The Academic Study of Indigenous Religions|last=Cox|first=James L.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-754-65569-5|location=Aldershot|pages=9–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term that is often used is "[[folk religion]]." While "ethnic religion" and "folk religion" have overlapping uses, the latter term implies "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|last=Bowker|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-191-72722-1|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Folk Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "folk religion" can therefore be used to speak of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Traditional African religion|African]] indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as [[Folk Christianity]] or [[Folk Islam]].

== Usage ==
Ethnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular [[ethnic group]] and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnicity and Religion: Intersections and Comparisons|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1-138-88037-5|editor-last=Ruane|editor-first=Joseph B.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Todd|editor-first2=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic religions include [[Hinduism]] of the [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Judaism]] of the [[Jews]], [[Chinese folk religion]] of the [[Han Chinese]], [[Shinto]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] of the [[Serer people|Serer]] of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann, Diedrich]]; Smith, Edwin William; Forde, Cyril Daryll; [[International African Institute]]; [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]]; [[Project Muse]]; [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63'', pp 86-96, 270-1, [[Edinburgh University Press]] for the International African Institute (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, such as [[Hinduism]] among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|diasporic Indians]] in the [[Caribbean]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa|eastern Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]],&lt;ref name="van der Veer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3773407 |last=van der Veer |first=Peter |author2=Steven Vertovec |date=April 1991 |title=Brahmanism Abroad: On Caribbean Hinduism as an Ethnic Religion |journal=Ethnology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=149–166|jstor=3773407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the role of [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and [[Afro-American religions]] among the [[African diaspora in the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/10/19/african-religions-gain-following-among-black-christians/|title=Are blacks abandoning Christianity for African faiths?|last=Oduah|first=Chika|date=19 October 2011|website=theGrio|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20541">The '''Family History Research Wiki''' (also known as the '''FamilySearch Research Wiki''' or the '''FamilySearch Wiki''') provides [[handbook]] reference information, and educational articles to help [[Genealogy|genealogists]] find and interpret records of their [[ancestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/The_Vision:_Why_We_Built_FamilySearch_Wiki The Vision: Why We Built the FamilySearch Wiki] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 6 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Find_an_ancestor_using_the_Wiki FamilySearch Wiki:About Us] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 6 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;It is a free-access, [[Free content|free-content]], [[online encyclopedia]] on a [[wiki]], hosted as part of the [[FamilySearch]] site.

Registration is free.

== Content ==

Most of the articles in this Wiki are about a place such as a town, county, state, province, or nation. Such articles suggest how to research records for information about ancestors in that jurisdiction. Every nation worldwide has at least one article. There are more articles for places in the United States, Canada, and Europe. So far, there are comparatively fewer pages for Africa, Asia, Australia, Latin America, or the Pacific Islands.

Contributors are invited to add any information about places to help researchers find, use, or better understand an ancestor's records. For example, information about local record idiosyncrasies, record gaps or record-loss, jurisdictional boundary changes, records housed in unusual places, or tips for using the records more effectively, is encouraged. Reference information about local jurisdictions, contact information, record start and stop dates, repositories, social life and customs that affected local record keeping are also welcome.

Content for a place-article may include maps, primary repository contact information, organization date, parent jurisdiction, internal sub-divisions such as towns or counties, boundary changes, record loss if any, neighboring localities, resources, local record types, local migration routes, and other local libraries, archives, societies, or museums.

Other types of pages&lt;ref name="FHPL" /&gt; in Family History Research Wiki are about:
:*record types (like ''census'', ''church'', ''land'', or ''vital'' records): descriptions, how to find them, and how to interpret them
:*short articles describing how to use a specific source like the Hamburg Passenger Lists, or Ontario Land Records
:*articles that explain how to corroborate similar multiple sources such as ''Tracing Immigrant Origins'' or U.S. military records
:*finding aids about specific reference tools and how to use them effectively
:*ethnic, religious, or political groups research
:*descriptions of significant repositories: libraries, archives, societies, museums, or Family History Centers with material of value to genealogical researchers
:*how to use selected genealogical software programs
:*research methodology—teaching the strategies or techniques for finding ancestors
:*migration routes like ports, rivers, canals, trails, roads, and railroads and their associated records
:*20 foreign-language word lists which give English translations of phrases typically found in genealogical documents
:*letter-writing guides to help researchers write letters in foreign languages to local record repositories
:*handwriting guides help readers understand old forms of handwriting or foreign alphabets
:*calendar information which might be listed in some genealogical documents, for example ''Fixed and Moveable Feast Days for Sweden''
:*blank genealogical forms such as family group records or pedigree charts
:*links to thousands of significant genealogical databases online
:*links to video lessons about how-to-do genealogical research
:*illustrations in articles frequently include maps, clickable maps, repository images, flags, and record type examples

The Family History Research Wiki is not a database of ancestors' names, photos, family stories, or [[Pedigree chart|pedigrees]]. Nor is it a place for genealogical queries, or message boards—however, it often explains and then links to such sites. Advertising, or product reviews would be inappropriate. Religious doctrines, church policies, and religious images do not belong on the Family History Research Wiki except where they directly impact genealogical research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/FamilySearch_Wiki:Purpose_and_Appropriate_Topics FamilySearch Wiki:Purpose and Appropriate Topics] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 6 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content history==
The [[Family History Library]] in Salt Lake City has over four thousand branches worldwide called [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|Family History Centers]]. These centers have volunteer staff who offer free research advice to visitors. To help these volunteers better answer questions about research, a series of "research outlines" and other publications by the Family History Library were developed starting about 1988.&lt;ref name="FHPL"&gt;Family History Library, ''Family History Publications List'' (Salt Lake City: Family History Library, 1995), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Family History Research Wiki was launched in late 2007, the electronic copies of the old paper publications of the Family History Library were immediately transferred into the wiki to become part of over 162 new articles. Of those articles, 86 were front-page-articles each linked to about 25 closely related topical sub-pages. For example, the front-page ''New Jersey Genealogy'' article was linked directly to the associated New Jersey Biography, New Jersey Cemeteries, and New Jersey Census pages, among others. Much of the early structure and phrasing of the wiki can be attributed to these publications. The old paper "research outlines" were the original kernel from which the Family History Research Wiki has grown.

==Platform history==
The Family History Research Wiki was launched 14 December 2007 when the main page was first edited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;dir=prev&amp;action=history Revision history of "Main Page"] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 6 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The wiki began on [[Plone (software)|Plone]] wiki software. However, it was soon discovered that [[MediaWiki]] software would be a better platform, so in January 2008 it was moved to the MediaWiki 1.17.1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Special:Version Version] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 8 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In late March 2016 it was moved to a newer, more-stable Wiki platform, WikiMedia 1.23.10, which does not require as much attention from FamilySearch computer engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Batson, e-mail "RE: What will the new software platform be?" to G. David Dilts, 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
Following the English language edition introduction in late 2007, the Family History Research Wiki has been rolled out in other languages. As of July 2014 it is available in 11 languages:&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/FamilySearch_Wiki:Non-English_versions_of_the_wiki FamilySearch Wiki:Non-English versions of the wiki] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

James Tanner in 2014 on his ''Genealogy Star'' blog said the Family History Research Wiki ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;is the one most valuable genealogical resource on the Web. I make no qualification in making that claim and have repeated it time and time again."&lt;ref&gt;James Tanner, [http://genealogysstar.blogspot.com/2014/09/have-i-mentioned-familysearch-research.html Have I mentioned the FamilySearch Research Wiki Recently?, September 4, 2014] in ''Genealogy Star'' blog (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Hitchmough in her 2016 lesson "FamilySearch: Using the Wiki" explained "Because no one can be an expert in all localities, records, languages, or ethnic groups, the purpose of the FamilySearch Wiki is to collaborate and share knowledge that is designed to encourage and eventually enable all people, anywhere in the world, to know where to find, how to use, and how to analyze genealogy records."&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hitchmough, "[http://www.qbfhs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FamilySearch-Wiki.pdf FamilySearch: Using the Wiki]" (.pdf 27 February 2016) (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federation of Genealogical Societies]] in 2014 used their blogtalkradio hour "mysociety" to explain how to leverage a society's Internet site by adding a Family History Research Wiki article linking to their society home page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voice.fgs.org/2014/10/the-familysearch-research-wiki-and-your.html The FamilySearch Research Wiki and Your Genealogy Society] in "mysociety" on "The Voice" (Federation of Genealogical Societies) (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The London FamilySearch Centre in the Reading Room at the National Archives near Kew Gardens, England wrote in March 2015, "The Research Wiki is a work in progress. It relies on members from the genealogical community to help add information to make it grow. YOU are the genealogical community! You may know of a database or information not already listed in the wiki."&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonfamilyhistory.org/familysearch-research-wiki-reaches-80000-articles/ FamilySearch Research Wiki Reaches 80,000 Articles] in ''London FamilySearch Centre'' (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The Wiki Governance Council oversees the direction and management of the Family History Research Wiki. Its purpose is to facilitate a valuable and productive experience for all Wiki users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/FamilySearch_Wiki:Wiki_Governance_Council FamilySearch Wiki:Wiki Governance Council] in ''Family History Research Wiki'' (accessed 7 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Food in England''''' is a 1954 book by the social historian [[Dorothy Hartley]]. It is both a [[cookery book]] and a history of [[English cuisine]]. It was acclaimed on publication; the contemporary critic [[Harold Nicolson]] described the book as a classic. It has remained in print ever since.

The book provides what has been called an idiosyncratic&lt;ref name=galequote/&gt; and a combative&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt; take on the history of English cooking. The book is unusual as a history in not citing its sources, serving more as an oral social history from Hartley's own experiences as she travelled England as a journalist for the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', interviewing "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors."&lt;ref name=WorsleyTelegraph/&gt; The book strikes some readers as principally a history,&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; but it consists mainly of recipes. Some of these such as [[stargazey pie]] are old-fashioned, but all are practical recipes that can be cooked.

==Context==

[[Dorothy Hartley]]'s mother was from Froncysylltau, near [[Llangollen]] in North Wales, where the family owned quarries and property. In 1933 Hartley moved to a house in Froncysylltau, where she lived for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Wondrausch, Mary, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50449, "Hartley, Dorothy Rosaman (1893–1985)",] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that she began work on the book for which she is best known,&lt;ref name=MERL/&gt; ''Food in England'', leading to its publication in 1954.

==Book==

===Approach===

Most of the chapters address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or ways of dealing with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history.&lt;ref name=WorsleyTelegraph/&gt; For example, chapter V, Meat, discusses "a rather interesting [[mediaeval]] miracle" and illustrates a traditional "Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net".&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; The text switches repeatedly from instructions ("To prepare mutton fat for a mutton piecrust, melt it over a bowl of hot water") to historical asides ("Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys").&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and frothing, switching between the past and present tenses: "Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat."&lt;ref name=WorsleyTelegraph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial part of the text consists of recipes. In the Meat chapter, these begin with recipes for beef, including "Baron of Beef", "Sirloin (Norman-French, ''sur loin'')", "Rib of Beef", "Boiled Beef with Carrots", and "Oat Pudding, for Boiled Beef".&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, pp. 71–75&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The first paragraph often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for [[sirloin]], she advises "This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. Never have the undercut taken out...". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: "Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed skewer. Roast carefully, basting frequently."&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Where quantities or cooking temperatures have to be specified, these are included in the instructions; otherwise, matters are left to the cook's discretion. Thus in "Spice Sauce (sauce for fish or flesh)", Hartley directs "Take a quart of sharp cider, .... some mace, a few cloves, some lemon peel, horse-radish root sliced, some sweet herbs, 6 schaloys [shallots], 8 anchovies, 3 spoonfulls&lt;!--SIC! This is a quote!--&gt; of shred red peppers..."&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

For baking, where exact instructions are needed, these are given in [[Imperial units]], but the oven temperature and timing are again left mainly to the cook's experience. Thus for "Bath Buns", she instructs: "Make a light dough with 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter or lard, 1 oz. of castor sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of lukewarm milk, and about 1.2 oz. of yeast. Rub butter into flour; blend ... Set it to rise in a warm place, ... bake lightly and thoroughly till golden brown."&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Contemporary===
On its publication in 1954, the book was received with immediate acclaim, and has remained in print ever since. ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' called it "fascinating…unusually readable";&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 145 May 1954, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' said, "it will become a classic", though he made gentle fun of the combative Englishness of Hartley's culinary pronouncements.&lt;ref name=Nicolson&gt;Nicolson, Harold, "English Fare", ''The Observer'', 22 August 1954, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
''[[The Sunday Times]]'', reviewing the seventh edition of the book, wrote "For food scholarship at its best see Dorothy Hartley's robust, idiosyncratic, irresistible ''Food in England''... As packed with diverse and fascinating information as a Scotch bun with fruit, this untidy bundle of erudition is held together by the writer's huge enjoyment of her subject, her immense curiosity about everything to do with the growth, preparation, preservation and eating of food in this country since the Middle Ages."&lt;ref name=galequote&gt;''Quoted'' at [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=1&amp;locID=wes_ttda&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;NA=Dorothy+Hartley "Dorothy Hartley"'] ''Gale Literary Databases: Contemporary Authors'', accessed 31 January 2010 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural historian [[Panikos Panayi]] describes the book as a tour de force, seminal, and richly illustrated; and he notes that ''Food in England'' is partly a recipe book, partly a history. He contrasts it favourably with Philip Harben's ''Traditional Dishes of Britain'', published a year earlier, which he criticises as accepting the "stereotypical stalwarts of British food", whereas Hartley rightly accepts (Panayi quotes) that "foreign dishes ... like the foreigners, become 'naturalised English'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panayi, Panikos |date=2010 |origyear=2008 |title=Spicing Up Britain |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-86189-658-2 |pages=16, 19, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of food [[Bee Wilson]], rereading "this endearing work" 58 years on for ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote that she had remembered it as a history book and an epic account of English cooking, "interspersed with recipes." She was therefore "startled" to find that almost the whole of the text is "taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative." Wilson finds the book as Hartley explicitly intended, an untidy kitchen, "a warm friendly place". For Hartley, writes Wilson, "the past is not a foreign country", but ever-present. She notes that Hartley "announces dogmatically" that English cooking is old-fashioned "because we like it that way." Wilson finds "Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as [[stargazey pie]] and [[posset]] ... mildly crazed." But whether mad or not, Hartley "approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist."&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Bee |authorlink1=Bee Wilson |title=Bee Wilson: rereading Food in England by Dorothy Hartley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/14/bee-wilson-rereading-food-england-hartley |accessdate=20 April 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Historic Royal Palaces]] curator [[Lucy Worsley]] presented a [[BBC]] film, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'Food in England', The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley'', on 6 November 2015.&lt;ref name=WorsleyBBC&gt;{{cite web |last1=Worsley |first1=Lucy |title=New BBC film: ‘Food in England, The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley’|url=http://www.lucyworsley.com/new-bbc-film-food-in-england-the-lost-world-of-dorothy-hartley/ |publisher=Lucy Worsley |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worsley, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', calls ''Food in England'' "the definitive history of the way the English eat." She describes the book as "laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations." She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks "the first rule of the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes." In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that "my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced." Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' column,{{efn|Her dispatches to the ''Daily Sketch'' 1933–1936 have been collected in a book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hartley |first1=Dorothy |last2=Worsley |first2=Lucy |title=Lost World: England 1933-1936 |date=2012 |publisher=Prospect Books |isbn=978-1-903-01897-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [https://prospectbooks.co.uk/samples/Hartley.pdf samples online].}} sometimes sleeping rough "in a hedge." The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors." The emphasis on [[local food|local]], [[seasonal food]] chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things.&lt;ref name=WorsleyTelegraph&gt;{{cite news |last1=Worsley |first1=Lucy |title=In praise of Dorothy Hartley's Food in England |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9656329/In-praise-of-Dorothy-Hartleys-Food-in-England.html |accessdate=20 April 2016|agency=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of English Rural Life]] at the [[University of Reading]] curates the Dorothy Hartley collection. It cites the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'s entry on Hartley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wondrausch, Mary |date=2004 |title=Hartley, Dorothy Rosaman (1893-1985) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50449}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; calling ''Food in England'' "Arguably her best work, and the one for which she will be remembered". It calls the book "as full of magic and potions as any medieval herbal."&lt;ref name="MERL"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Museum of English Rural Life: The Dorothy Hartley Collection |url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/merl/collections/Archives_A_to_Z/merl-D_HART.aspx |publisher=University of Reading |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gold Drawing Room''' of the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]] was one of the rooms of the palace reconstructed following the fire of 1837 by the architect [[Alexander Briullov]].&lt;ref&gt;The State Hermitage Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The vaulted ceiling and window embrasures give this large room a cavernous air.

Following her marriage in 1841, it became the most formal of the rooms comprising the suite of [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna]]. It was refurbished for her by Andrei Stakenschneider, who employed heavy gilt mouldings for the ceiling and walls in a [[Byzantine]] style. The room contains a fireplace of marble and jasper with a [[mosaic]] by Etienne Moderni
Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

The '''''Great Greek Encyclopedia''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Μεγάλη Ελληνική Εγκυκλοπαίδεια'') is a general knowledge [[Modern Greek language|Greek-language]] [[encyclopedia]], printed initially between 1926 and 1934.

The encyclopedia was founded in 1926 by [[Pavlos Drandakis]] (1896–1945) after the model of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. He was helped by many well-known and qualified contributors and the result was deemed to be excellent. [[Pyrsos|Pyrsos, Ltd.]] was commissioned with printing the encyclopedia. Pavlos Drandakis reserved some rights of the encyclopedia which he later claimed in court. After he won the trial, his descendants published a second edition of the encyclopedia in 1956 with [[Phoinix, Ltd]].

The encyclopedia consists of 24 volumes, one of which is especially dedicated to [[Greece]]. The encyclopedia is known for the extensive use of [[Katharevousa]].

The concept borrows from the process to [[harmonization|harmonize]] discordant music.

The goal is to find commonalities, identify critical requirements that need to be retained, and provide a common standard. For businesses, harmonization cuts compliance costs and simplifies the process of meeting requirements. It also reduces complexity for those tasked with testing and auditing standards compliance.

{{Islam |history}}

The '''history of Islam''' concerns the political, social, economic and cultural developments of the [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]]. Despite concerns about the reliability of early sources, most historians&lt;ref name="Watt2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=William Montgomery |authorlink=W. Montgomery Watt |title=Islam and the Integration of Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQUZ6BGyohQC |year=2003 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-17587-6 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQUZ6BGyohQC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Islam originated in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] at the start of the 7th century, approximately 600 years after the founding of [[Christianity]]. [[Muslim]]s, however, believe that it did not start with [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], but that it was the original faith of others whom they regard as [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]], such as [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], [[David in Islam|David]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Noah in Islam|Noah]] and [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].&lt;ref name="Esposito1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John |title= Islam: The Straight Path (3rd ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511234-4 |pages=9, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito2002b"&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=F.E. |title=Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-11553-5 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 610 [[Common Era|CE]], [[Muhammad]] began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations.&lt;ref name="Muhammad p. 363"&gt;"Key themes in these early recitations include the idea of the moral responsibility of man who was created by God and the idea of the judgment to take place on the day of resurrection. [...] Another major theme of Muhammad's early preaching, [... is that] there is a power greater than man's, and that the wise will acknowledge this power and cease their greed and suppression of the poor." F.&amp;nbsp;Buhl &amp; A.T.&amp;nbsp;Welch, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Muhammad", vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;363.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's message [[Timing of Sahabah becoming Muslims|won over a handful of followers]] and was met with [[Persecution of Muslims by Meccans|increasing opposition from Meccan notables]].&lt;ref name="Mecca. p. 364"&gt;"At first Muhammad met with no serious opposition [...] He was only gradually led to attack on principle the gods of Mecca. [...] Meccan merchants then discovered that a religious revolution might be dangerous to their fairs and their trade." F.&amp;nbsp;Buhl &amp; A.T.&amp;nbsp;Welch, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Muhammad", vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;364.&lt;/ref&gt; In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]], Muhammad [[Hegira|migrated to the city of Yathrib]] (now known as Medina). With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would [[Succession to Muhammad|succeed him as leader of the Muslim community]] which was eventually resurrected leading to the [[First Fitna]]. The dispute would intensify greatly after the [[Battle of Karbala]], in which Muhammad's grandson [[Hussein ibn Ali]] was killed by the ruling [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Yazid&amp;nbsp;I]], and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community.

By the [[8th century]], the [[Historical powers#Arab Caliphates|Islamic empire]] extended from [[Al-Andalus|Iberia]] in the west to the [[Indus river]] in the east. Polities such as those ruled by the Umayyads (in the [[Middle East]] and later in [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Iberia]]), [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], and [[Mamluk]]s were among the most influential powers in the world. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] gave rise to many centers of culture and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]] and produced notable [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomers]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians]], [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|doctors]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].

In the early [[13th century]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]] took over northern parts of [[Indian subcontinent]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, destructive [[Mongol invasions]] from the East, along with the loss of population in the [[Black Death]], greatly weakened the traditional centers of the Islamic world, stretching from [[Persia]] to [[Egypt]], but in the [[Early Modern period]], the [[Ottomans]], the [[Safavids]], and the [[Mughals]] were able to create new world powers again. During the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries, most parts of the [[Muslim world]] fell under the influence or direct control of [[Europe]]an "[[Great Powers]]." Their efforts to win independence and build modern nation states over the course of the last two centuries continue to reverberate to the present day.

==Timeline==
{{Main|Timeline of Muslim history}}

The following timeline can serve as a rough visual guide to the most important polities in the Islamic world prior to the [[First World War]]. It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including [[Arabia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]), [[Levant]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Israel/Palestine]]), [[Egypt]], [[Maghreb]] (north-west Africa), [[al-Andalus]] ([[Iberia]]), [[Transoxania]] ([[Central Asia]]), [[Hindustan]] (including modern [[Pakistan]]), and [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]). It is necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during the later stages of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], even the capital city of [[Baghdad]] was effectively ruled by other dynasties such as the [[Buyyids]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]], while the [[Ottomans]] commonly delegated executive authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the [[Dey]]s of Algiers, the [[Beys of Tunis]], and the [[Mamluks of Iraq]].

==Early sources==
{{main|Historiography of early Islam}}

The study of the earliest periods in Islamic history is made difficult by a lack of sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=628}} For example, the most important historiographical source for the origins of Islam is the work of [[al-Tabari]].{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=6}}  While [[al-Tabari]] was an excellent historian by the standards of his time and place, use of his work as a source is problematic for two reasons.  For one, his style of historical writing permitted liberal use of mythical, legendary, stereotyped, distorted, and polemical presentations of its subject matter. Second, al-Tabari's descriptions of the beginning of Islam post-date the events by a large amount of time, al-Tabari having died in 923.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=2}}{{sfn|Hughes|2013|p=56}}

Differing views about how to deal with the available sources has led to the development of four different approaches to the history of early Islam.  All four methods have some level of support today.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Hughes|2013|pp=6 &amp; 7}}, who links the practice of source and tradition (or [[form criticism|form]]) criticism as one approach.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''descriptive'' method uses the outlines of Islamic traditions, while being adjusted for the stories of miracles and faith-centred claims within those sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=629, 633}} [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Gustav Weil]] represent some of the first historians following the descriptive method.  On the ''[[source criticism|source critical]]'' method, a comparison of all the sources is sought in order to identify which informants to the sources are weak and thereby distinguish spurious material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=630}}  The work of [[William Montgomery Watt]] and that of [[Wilferd Madelung]] are two source critical examples.  On the ''[[tradition criticism|tradition critical]]'' method, the sources are believed to be based on oral traditions with unclear origins and transmission history, and so are treated very cautiously.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=631}} [[Ignaz Goldziher]] was the pioneer of the tradition critical method, and [[Uri Rubin]] gives a contemporary example.  The ''skeptical'' method doubts nearly all of the material in the traditional sources, regarding any possible historical core as too difficult to decipher from distorted and fabricated material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=632}}  An early example of the skeptical method was the work of [[John Wansbrough]].

Nowadays, the popularity of the different methods employed varies on the scope of the works under consideration. For overview treatments of the history of early Islam, the descriptive approach is more popular.  For scholars who look at the beginnings of Islam in depth, the source critical and tradition critical methods are more often followed.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}

After the 8th century, the quality of sources improves.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}}  Those sources which treated earlier times with a large temporal and cultural gap now begin to give accounts which are more contemporaneous, the quality of genre of available historical accounts improves, and new documentary sources—such as official documents, correspondence and poetry—appear.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}} For the time prior to the beginning of Islam—in the 6th century—sources are superior as well, if still of mixed quality. In particular, the sources covering the [[Sasanian]] realm of influence in the 6th century are poor, while the sources for Byzantine areas at the time are of a respectable quality, and complemented by [[Syriac Christian]] sources for Syria and Iraq.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|pp=4, 5}}

Islam arose within the context of [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p= 9}} The second half of the sixth century saw political disorder in Arabia, and communication routes were no longer secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Christian Julien Robin|title= Arabia and Ethiopia.

According to tradition, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca around the year 570.&lt;ref&gt;"The very first question a biographer has to ask, namely when the person was born, cannot be answered precisely for Muhammad. [...] Muhammad's biographers usually make him 40 or sometimes 43 years old at the time of his call to be a prophet, which [...] would put the year of his birth at about 570 A.D." F.&amp;nbsp;Buhl &amp; A.T.&amp;nbsp;Welch, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Muhammad", vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;361.&lt;/ref&gt;  His family belonged to the [[Quraysh]]. When he was about forty years old he began receiving what Muslims regard as divine revelations delivered through the angel [[Gabriel]], which would later form the [[Quran]]. These inspirations  enjoined him to proclaim a strict [[Monotheism|monotheistic faith]], to warn his compatriots of the impending [[Judgement Day]], and to castigate social injustices of his city.&lt;ref name="Muhammad p. 363"/&gt; Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca.&lt;ref name="Mecca. p. 364"/&gt; In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]], Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called [[Medina]]) where he was joined by his followers.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=187}} Later generations would count this event, known as the [[Hegira|hijra]], as the start of the Islamic era.&lt;ref name="Hourani15-19"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Hourani|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=15–19|isbn=9780674010178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yathrib, where he was accepted as an arbitrator among the different communities of the city under the terms of the [[Constitution of Medina]], Muhammad began to lay the foundations of the new Islamic society, with the help of new Quranic verses which provided guidance on matters of law and religious observance.&lt;ref name="Hourani15-19"/&gt; The [[surah]]s of this period emphasized his place among the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|long line]] of Biblical prophets, but also differentiated the message of the Quran from Christianity and Judaism.&lt;ref name="Hourani15-19"/&gt; Armed conflict with Meccans and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Jewish tribes]] of the Yathrib area soon broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad At Medina|date=1956|publisher=Oxford At The Clarendon Press|pages=1–17, 192–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of military confrontations and political maneuvers, Muhammad was able to [[Occupation of Mecca|secure control of Mecca]] and allegiance of the Quraysh in 629.&lt;ref name="Hourani15-19"/&gt; In the time remaining until his death in 632, tribal chiefs across the peninsula entered into various agreements with him, some under terms of alliance, others acknowledging his prophethood and agreeing to follow Islamic practices, including paying the [[Zakat|alms levy]] to his government, which consisted of a number of deputies, an army of believers, and a public treasury.&lt;ref name="Hourani15-19"/&gt; A few months before his death, Muhammad [[The event of Ghadir Khumm|delivered a sermon regarding his succession]]. The final verse of the Qur'an (Chapter 5, Verse 3) was revealed after Muhammad finished his sermon. After the sermon, Muhammad ordered the Muslims to pledge allegiance to [[Ali]]; [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]] were among those pledged allegiance to Ali at this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia|url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team|website=Al-Islam.org|publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Volume 4|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Razi|first1=Fakhr|title=Tafsir al-Kabir, Volume 12|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Tabrizi|first1=al-Khatib|title=Mishkat al-Masabih|page=557}}

[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|The Rashidun caliphate]]

After Muhammad died, a series of four Caliphs governed the Islamic state: [[Abu Bakr]] (632–634), [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (Umar І, 634–644), [[Uthman ibn Affan]], (644–656), and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] (656–661).  These leaders are known as the "[[Rashidun]]" or "rightly guided" Caliphs in [[Sunni Islam]]. They oversaw the initial phase of the [[Muslim conquests]], advancing through [[Persia]], [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and [[North Africa]].

After Muhammad's death, [[Abu Bakr]], one of his closest associates, was chosen as the first [[caliph]] ({{lang-ar|خَليفة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|khalīfah}}'', lit. successor). Although the office of caliph retained an aura of religious authority, it laid no claim to prophecy.&lt;ref name="Hourani22"/&gt; A number of tribal leaders refused to extend agreements made with Muhammad to Abu Bakr, ceasing payments of the alms levy and in some cases claiming to be prophets in their own right.&lt;ref name="Hourani22"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Hourani|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=22–23|isbn=9780674010178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Bakr asserted his authority in a successful military campaign known as the [[Ridda wars]], whose momentum was carried into the lands of the [[Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;"The immediate outcome of the Muslim victories was turmoil. Medina's victories led allied tribes to attack the non-aligned to compensate for their own losses. The pressure drove tribes [...] across the imperial frontiers. The Bakr tribe, which had defeated a Persian detachment in 606, joined forces with the Muslims and led them on a raid in southern Iraq [...] A similar spilling over of tribal raiding occurred on the Syrian frontiers. Abu Bakr encouraged these movements [...] What began as inter-tribal skirmishing to consolidate a political confederation in Arabia ended as a full-scale war against the two empires."{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the reign of the second caliph, Umar I, Arab armies, whose battle-hardened ranks were now swelled by the defeated rebels&lt;ref&gt;"In dealing with captured leaders Abu Bakr showed great clemency, and many became active supporters of the cause of Islam." W.&amp;nbsp;Montgomery Watt, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Abu Bakr", vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;110. "Umar's subsequent decision (reversing the exclusionary policy of Abu Bakr) to allow those tribes whichhad rebelled during the course of the Ridda wars and been subdued to participate in the expanding incursions into and attacks on the Fertile Crescent [...] incorporated the defeated Arabs into the polity as Muslims." {{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former imperial auxiliary troops,&lt;ref&gt;[N]on-Muslim sources allow us to perceive an additional advantage, namely, that Arabs had been serving in the armies of Byzantium and Persia long before Islam; they had acquired valuable training in the weaponry and military tactics of the empires and had become to some degree acculturated to their ways. In fact, these sources hint that we should view many in Muhammad’s west Arabian coalition, its settled members as well as its nomads, not so much as outsiders seeking to despoil the empires but as insiders trying to grab a share of the wealth of their imperial masters.{{Harvtxt|Hoyland|2014|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; conquered the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt, while the Sassanids [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Conquest of Mesopotamia .28636.E2.80.93638.29|lost their western territories]], with the rest to follow [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Conquest of Persia .28642.E2.80.93651.29|soon afterwards]].&lt;ref name="Hourani22"/&gt;

Umar improved administration of the fledgling empire, ordering improvement of irrigation networks and playing a role in foundation of cities like [[Basra]]. To be close to the poor, he lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening.

Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, who lived as religious minorities and were taxed (while Muslims paid "Zakat") to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann (2007), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; As new areas were conquered, they also benefited from free trade with other areas of the growing Islamic state, where, to encourage commerce, taxes were applied to wealth rather than trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam: An Illustrated History'' by Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville, Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslims paid [[Zakat]] on their wealth for the benefit of the poor.

When Umar was assassinated in 644, [[Uthman ibn Affan]] became the next caliph. As the Arabic language is written without vowels, speakers of different Arabic dialects and other languages recited the Quran with phonetic variations that could alter the meaning of the text. When Uthman ibn Affan became aware of this, he ordered a standard copy of the Quran to be prepared. Begun during his reign, the [[History of the Quran|compilation of the Quran]] was finished some time between 650 and 656, and copies were sent out to the different centers of the expanding Islamic empire.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie; Barbar Rivolta (Summer, 1992).

However, after Muhammad's death, the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Following the [[Roman–Persian Wars]] and the [[Byzantine–Sassanid Wars]] deep-rooted differences between Iraq (formerly under the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]]) and Syria (formerly under the [[Byzantine Empire]]) also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area.&lt;ref&gt;''Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War'' by Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Uthman ibn Affan]] became very old, [[Marwan I]], a relative of [[Muawiyah I]], slipped into the vacuum, becoming his secretary and slowly assuming more control. When Uthman was assassinated in 656, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, assumed the position of caliph and moved the capital to Kufa in Iraq. Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, and Marwan I demanded arrest of the culprits. Marwan I manipulated every one and created conflict, which resulted in the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the "First Fitna"). Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. Six months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Ali's son [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], made a peace treaty with Muawiyah I. In the [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty]], Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he would be just to the people and not establish a dynasty after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilferd Madelung|title=The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64696-3|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_3_49.php|title=Sahih Bukhari : Book of "Peacemaking"|first=Sahih|last=Bukhari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muawiyah subsequently broke the conditions of the agreement and established the [[Umayyad dynasty]], with a capital in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Holt|1977a|pp=67–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Husayn ibn Ali]], by then Muhammad's only living grandson, refused to swear allegiance to the Umayyads.

==Umayyad Caliphate==
{{main|Umayyad Caliphate}}
[[File:Umayyad750ADloc.png|thumb|The Umayyad caliphate]]

The Umayyad dynasty (or ''Ommiads''), whose name derives from [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams]], the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph, ruled from 661 to 750. Although the Umayyad family came from the city of [[Mecca]], [[Damascus]] was the capital. After the death of [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]] in 666,&lt;ref&gt;''The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate'' by Wilferd Madelung. p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedic ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: A-I'', Volume 1 edited by R. Khanam. p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muawiyah I]] consolidated his power. Muawiyah I moved his capital to Damascus from [[Medina]], which led to profound changes in the empire. In the same way, at a later date, the transfer of the Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad marked the accession of a new family to power.

As the state grew, the state expenses increased. Additionally the [[Bayt al-mal]] and the Welfare State expenses to assist the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled, increased, the Umayyads asked the new converts (mawali) to continue paying the poll tax. The Umayyad rule, with its wealth and luxury also seemed at odds with the Islamic message preached by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Politics'' John L. Esposito  1998 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'' by Benjamin Jokisch - 2007 p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Byzantine And Early Islamic Near East'' Hugh N.

Meri p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] rallied discontented ''mawali'', poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of the general [[Abu Muslim]], inaugurating the [[Abbasid dynasty]] in 750, which moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2002|p=56}}; {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1993|pp=71–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the [[Ummayad]] family fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], which lasted until 1031 before falling due to the [[Fitna of al-Andalus]]. The Bayt al-mal, the Welfare State then continued under the Abbasids.

According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali.

Under the rule of [[Yazid I]], some Muslims in Kufa began to think that if [[Husayn ibn Ali]] the descendent of Muhammad was their ruler, he would have been more just. He was invited to Kufa but was later betrayed and killed. Imam Husain's son, Imam [[Ali ibn Husain]], was imprisoned along with Husain's sister and other ladies left in [[Karbala]] war. Due to opposition by public they were later released and allowed to go to their native place Medina. One Imam after another continued in the generation of Imam Husain but they were opposed by the Caliphs of the day as their rivals till Imam [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] came in power as first Caliph of [[Fatimid]] in North Africa when Caliphate and Imamate came to same person again after Imam Ali. These Imams were recognized by Shia Islam taking Imam Ali as first Caliph/ Imam and the same is institutionalised by the [[Safavids]] and many similar institutions named now as [[Ismaili]], [[Twelver]] etc.

The period under [[Muawiya II]] was marked by civil wars ([[Second Fitna]]). This would ease in the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], a well-educated and capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a [[currency]] for the Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under [[Justinian II]] ([[Battle of Sebastopolis]]) in 692 in [[Asia Minor]]. The Byzantines were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of [[Slavs]]. The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He reformed agriculture and commerce.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular [[postal service]].

The [[Visigoths]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] were defeated when the Umayyad conquered [[Lisbon]]. The Iberian Peninsula was the farthest extent of Islamic control of Europe (they were stopped at the [[Battle of Tours]]). In the east, Islamic armies under [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] made it as far as the [[Indus Valley]]. Under Al-Walid, the caliphate empire stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to India. [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] played a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the Umayyad era., This tactic was crucial for the expansion to the Iberian Peninsula. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power.

[[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He appointed [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] governor of [[Mesopotamia]]. Sulayman ordered the arrest and execution of the family of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], one of two prominent leaders (the other was [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]) who had supported the succession of al-Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to [[Damascus]] on becoming Caliph, remaining in [[Ramla]]. Sulayman sent [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] to attack the Byzantine capital ([[Siege of Constantinople (717–18)|siege of Constantinople]]). The intervention of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] on the Byzantine side proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in 717.

[[Yazid II]] came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;In the Al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula), North Africa and in the east populations revolted. In A.H. 102 (720–721) in Ifriqiyah, the harsh governor Yazid ibn Muslim was overthrown and Muhammad ibn Yazid, the former governor, restored to power. The caliph accepted this and confirmed Muhammad ibn Yazid as governor of Ifriqiyah.&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce the [[Berber Revolt]]. He was also faced with a revolt by [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. Hisham suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught and punished or executed by eastern governors. The [[Battle of Akroinon]], a decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;*Eggenberger, David (1985). ''An Encyclopedia of Battles: Accounts of Over 1,560 Battles from 1479 BC. to the Present''. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-24913-1}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hisham died in 743.

[[Al-Walid II]] saw political intrigue during his reign. [[Yazid III]] spoke out against his cousin Walid's "immorality" which included discrimination on behalf of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis]] and [[Mawali|non-Arab Muslims]], and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human [[free will]]).&lt;ref&gt;von Ess, "Kadar", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Walid was shortly thereafter deposed in a [[coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus. Quoted Robert Hoyland, ''Seeing Islam as Others Saw It'' (Darwin Press, 1998), 660&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid disbursed funds from the treasury and acceded to the Caliph. He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna. Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and dissident movements arose, after which he died. [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid]], named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before he abdicated. [[Marwan II]] ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force. Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince [[Abd al-Rahman I|Abd al-Rahman]] who escaped to the Iberian Peninsula and founded a dynasty there.

[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|Abbasid caliphate]]
The [[Abbasid]] dynasty rose to power in 750, consolidating the gains of the earlier [[Caliphate]]s. Initially, they conquered [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] including the [[Balearics]] and, after, in 827 the [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Islam"&gt;J. Jomier. Islam: Encyclopaedia of Islam Online. accessdate=2007-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ruling party]] had come to power on the wave of dissatisfaction with the Umayyads, cultivated by the Abbasid revolutionary [[Abu Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1993|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977a|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Abbasids Islamic civilization flourished. Most notable was the development of Arabic [[Arabic literature|prose]] and [[Arabic poetry|poetry]], termed by ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' as its "[[Golden Age of Islam|golden age]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977b|pp=661–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commerce and industry (considered a [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]]) and the [[Islamic arts|arts]] and sciences (considered a [[Islamic science|Muslim Scientific Revolution]]) also prospered under Abbasid caliphs [[al-Mansur]] (ruled 754–775), [[Harun al-Rashid]] (ruled 786–809), [[al-Ma'mun]] (ruled 809–813) and their immediate successors.&lt;ref name="B.a-d"&gt;"Abbasid Dynasty", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital was moved from Damascus to [[Baghdad]], due to the importance placed by the Abbasids upon eastern affairs in [[Persia]] and [[Transoxania]].&lt;ref name="B.a-d" /&gt; At this time the caliphate showed signs of fracture amid the rise of regional dynasties. Although the Umayyad family had been killed by the revolting Abbasids, one family member, [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], escaped to Spain and established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the [[Maghreb]], Harun al-Rashid appointed the Arab [[Aghlabid]]s as virtually autonomous rulers, although they continued to recognise central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived, and they were deposed by the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty in 909. By around 960, the Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called "''al-Qahirah''" (meaning "the planet of victory", known today as [[Cairo]]). In Persia the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Ghaznavid]]s snatched power from the Abbasids.&lt;ref name="B-I"&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AHGC"/&gt; Abbasid influence had been consumed by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] (a Muslim Turkish clan which had migrated into mainland Persia) by 1055.&lt;ref name="B.a-d" /&gt;

Expansion continued, sometimes by force, sometimes by peaceful [[Dawah|proselytising]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Islam"/&gt; The first stage in the [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent|conquest of India]] began just before the year 1000. By some 200 (from 1193–1209) years later, the area up to the [[Ganges river]] had fallen. In sub-Saharan West Africa, Islam was established just after the year 1000. Muslim rulers were in [[Kanem Region|Kanem]] starting from sometime between 1081 and 1097, with reports of a Muslim prince at the head of [[Gao]] as early as 1009. The [[Mali Empire|Islamic kingdoms associated with Mali]] reached prominence in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Islam". Encyclopaedia of Islam Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbasids developed initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], "The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the [[kinship]]-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic [[ecumenism]], promoted by the Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the ''[[Ummah]]'' in the literal meaning: that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the [[Shariah]] was codified, and the four [[Madhabs]] were established. This era also saw the rise of classical [[Sufism]]. Religious achievements included completion of the canonical collections of [[Hadith]] of [[Sahih Bukhari]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam recognized to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the Quran identifying [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" or "baptists" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandean]]s and related Mesopotamian groups) as "[[people of the book]]". Toward the beginning of the high Middle Ages, the doctrines of the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]], two major [[Islamic schools and branches|denominations of Islam]], solidified and the [[divisions of the world in Islam|divisions of the world]] theologically would form. These trends would continue into the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods.

Politically, the Abbasid Caliphate evolved into an Islamic [[monarchy]] ([[unitary state|unitary system of government]].) The regional [[Sultanate]] and [[Emirate]] governors' existence, validity, or legality were acknowledged for unity of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khaddūrī|2002|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early Islamic philosophy]] of the [[#Berbers and Iberian Umayyads|Iberian Umayyads]], [[Averroes]] presented an argument in ''The Decisive Treatise'', providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official [[Ash'ari]] theology; thus, [[Averroism]] has been considered a precursor to modern [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri.

According to Arab sources in the year 750, [[Al-Saffah]], the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan near Talas. After eliminating the entire Umayyad family and achieving victory at the [[Battle of the Zab]], Al-Saffah and his forces marched into Damascus and founded a new dynasty. His forces confronted many regional powers and consolidated the realm of the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;for more, see [[As-Saffah#As-Saffah.27s Caliphate|As-Saffah's_Caliphate]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|An Arabic manuscript written under the second half of the Abbasid Era.]]
In [[Al-Mansur]]'s time, Persian scholarship emerged. Many non-Arabs converted to Islam. The Umayyads actively discouraged conversion in order to continue the collection of the jizya, or the tax on non-Muslims. Islam nearly doubled within its territory from 8% of residents in 750 to 15% by the end of Al-Mansur's reign. [[Al-Mahdi]], whose name means "Rightly-guided" or "Redeemer", was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his deathbed. Baghdad blossomed during Al-Mahdi's reign, becoming the world's largest city. It attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia and as far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. Like his father, [[Al-Hadi]]&lt;ref&gt;An universal history: from the earliest accounts to the present time, Volume 2 By George Sale, George Psalmanazar, Archibald Bower, George Shelvocke, John Campbell, John Swinton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=taoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA319 p. 319]&lt;/ref&gt; was open to his people and allowed citizens to address him in the palace at Baghdad. He was considered an "enlightened ruler", and continued the policies of his Abbasid predecessors. His short rule was plagued by military conflicts and internal intrigue.

The military conflicts subsided as [[Harun al-Rashid]] ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Chamber's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge, Volume 5. W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1890. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WlYWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA567 p. 567].&lt;/ref&gt; His reign was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity. He established the library [[Bayt al-Hikma]] ("House of Wisdom"), and the arts and music flourished during his reign. The [[Barmakid]] family played a decisive advisorial role in establishing the Caliphate, but declined during Rashid's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes P. Schadé (ed.). Encyclopedia of World Religions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Amin]] received the Caliphate from his father Harun Al-Rashid, but failed to respect the arrangements made for his brothers, leading to the [[Fourth Fitna]].  [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s general [[Tahir ibn Husayn]] [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)|took Baghdad]], executing Al-Amin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] History volume xxxi, "The War Between Brothers," transl. Michael Fishbein, SUNY, Albany, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The war led to a loss of prestige for the dynasty.

==== Rise of regional powers====
[[File:EditedStattering.png|thumb|Regional powers born out of the fragmentation of the Abbasid caliphate]]
The Abbasids soon became caught in a three-way rivalry among [[Copt]]ic Arabs, [[Indo-Persian]]s, and immigrant Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|pp=121–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the cost of running a large empire became too great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|1988|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs adhered to the Sunnite sect; the Persians,  a great portion of the Turkic groups, and several of the princes in India were Shia. The political unity of Islam began to disintegrate. Under the influence of the Abbasid caliphs, independent dynasties appeared in the Muslim world and the caliphs recognized such dynasties as legitimately Muslim. The first was the [[Tahirid dynasty]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which was founded during the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign. Similar dynasties included the [[Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]] and [[Seljuqs]]. During this time, advancements were made in the areas of astronomy, poetry, philosophy, science, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Spencer Baynes|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtpTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA578|year=1878|publisher=A. and C.

Upon Al-Amin's death, [[Al-Ma'mun]] became Caliph. Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory during his reign and dealt with rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan. There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of Al-Ma'mun's reign. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious, but Ghassan ibn Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for Al-Ma'mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army, killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful, frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the [[Tahirid dynasty]] became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and other opponents.

Al-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the ''[[Mihna]]'', the [[Abbasid inquisition]] which he introduced in 833 four months before he died.&lt;ref&gt;The Mihna subjected traditionalist scholars with social influence and intellectual quality to imprisonment, religious tests, and loyalty oaths. Al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The Mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the state of the creation of the Qur'an: if the person interrogated stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, he was free to leave and continue his profession.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ulama]]'' emerged as a force in Islamic politics during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The ''Ulema'' and the major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel, Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced.

During the Al-Ma'mun regime, [[List of border conflicts|border war]]s increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died while leading an expedition in [[Sardis]]. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Had he been victorious over the Byzantine Emperor, Al-Ma'mun would have made a condition of peace be that the emperor hand over of a copy of the "Almagest".&lt;/ref&gt; His scientists originated [[alchemy]]. Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] to search for knowledge and treasure. Workers tunneled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Al-Mu'tasim]], rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn Al-Ma'mun.

As Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory. [[Theophilos (emperor)|Byzantine emperor Theophilus]] launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the [[Battle of Anzen]]. On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and [[ghilman]] slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the [[Mamluk]] system). The Khurramiyyah were never fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine, but he defeated the rebels.

During Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] was employed by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the caliph's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, History v. 32 "The Reunification of the Abbasid Caliphate," SUNY, Albany, 1987; v. 33 "Storm and Stress along the Northern frontiers of the Abbasid Caliphate," transl. C.E. Bosworth, SUNY, Albany, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Wathiq]] succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew, as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred songs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] History v. 34 "Incipient Decline," transl. Joel L. Kramer, SUNY, Albany, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88706-875-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Samarra.jpg|thumb|[[Malwiya|Minaret]] at the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]].]]
When Al-Wathiq died of high fever, [[Al-Mutawakkil]] succeeded him. Al-Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]&lt;ref&gt;Its minarets were spiraling cones {{convert|55|m|ft}} high with a spiral ramp, and it had 17 aisles with walls paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine the Philosopher]], who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate by [[Michael III|Emperor Michael III]]. Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Shīʻi faced repression embodied in the destruction of the [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine of Hussayn ibn ʻAlī]], an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish soldier.

[[Al-Muntasir]] succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select his successor, electing [[Al-Musta'in]]. The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to [[Al-Mu'tazz]] but was put to death by his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest Abbasaid Caliph to assume power.

Al-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At [[Samarra]], the Turks were having problems with the "Westerns" (Berbers and [[Moor (people)|Moor]]s), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in, regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks, Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly thereafter. [[Al-Muhtadi]] became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks killed him soon after his ascension. [[Al-Mu'tamid]] followed, holding on for 23 years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the [[Zanj Rebellion]], Al-Mu'tamid summoned [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|al-Muwaffak]] to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in all but name. The [[Hamdanid dynasty]] was founded by [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]] when he was appointed governor of [[Mardin]] in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid later transferred authority to his son, [[al-Mu'tadid]], and never regained power. The [[Tulunids]] became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they broke away during this time.

Al-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, [[Al-Muktafi]], succeeded to the throne.

Al-Muktafi became a favorite of the people for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the [[Carmathians]]. &lt;!-- prevailed more or less with the Byzantines, who were not slow to take advantage of the Caliphate's difficulties.what does this mean? hostilities do not prevail. one or the other combatants might. "War was kept up with various fortune on both sides." Did the fortunes fund the war or did both sides have success?--&gt; Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose [[Al-Muqtadir]]. Al-Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence, and the Greeks raided across the undefended border. The East continued to formally recognise the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed independence.

At the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina]] pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the ransom of the Muslim prisoner&lt;ref&gt;A sum of 120,000 golden pieces was paid for the freedom of the captives.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother [[al-Qahir]]. He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into prison.

His son [[Ar-Radi]] took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune. Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, [[Ibn Raik]] (''[[amir al-umara]]''; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around this period, the [[Hanbali]]s, supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day, to take counsel on the affairs of State;  to distribute [[Alms and Almsgiving|alms]], or to temper the severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids.

In the late mid-930s, the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] of Egypt carried the Arabic title "Wali" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor ([[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]]) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is Soghdian for "prince".

Also in the 930s, [['Imad al-Daula|‘Alī ibn Būyah]] and his two younger brothers, [[Rukn al-Daula|al-Hassan]] and [[Mu'izz al-Daula|Aḥmad]] founded the [[Buyid dynasty|Būyid confederation]]. Originally a soldier in the service of the [[Ziyarids|Ziyārīds]] of [[Tabaristan|Ṭabaristān]], ‘Alī was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from [[Baghdad]] named Yāqūt in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad. The Būyids made large territorial gains. [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Jibal]] were conquered. Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the Būyids took [[Kerman|Kermān]] (967), [[Oman]] (967), the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīra]] (979), Ṭabaristān (980), and [[Gorgan]] (981). After this the Būyids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming ''de facto'' independent.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the former include the loss of [[Mosul]] in 990, and the loss of Ṭabaristān and Gurgān in 997. An example of the latter is the [[Kakuyids|Kakūyid]] dynasty of [[Isfahan|Isfahān]], whose fortunes rose with the decline of the Būyids of northern Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirham of al-Muttaqi.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Al-Muttaqi]]
At the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance. The ''amir al-umara'' [[Bajkam]] contented himself with dispatching his secretary to Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on [[Al-Muttaqi]]. Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid [[Nasir al-Dawla]] advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks repelled them. Turkish general [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] became ''amir al-umara''. The Turks were staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at [[Raqqa]], moving to Tuzun where he was deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the title of [[Al-Mustakfi]]. With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the [[Buwayhid dynasty]] and the [[Hamdanids]]. Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Harold | last = Bowen | title = The Life and Times of ʿAlí Ibn ʿÍsà: The Good Vizier | year = 1928 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TZM3AAAAIAAJ | page = 385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, [[Al-Muti]] became caliph. The office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in [[Iberia]]. Buwayhid Sultan [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] was prevented from raising a Shi'a Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion, in the capital and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Frye (1975). The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume Four: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs. {{ISBN|0-521-20093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Caliph, [[Al-Ta'i]], reigned over factional strife in Syria among the Fatimids, Turks, and Carmathians. The Hideaway dynasyty also fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states. [[Baha' al-Dawla]], the Buyid amir of Iraq, deposed al-Ta'i in 991 and proclaimed [[al-Qadir]] the new caliph.&lt;ref name=Hanne&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanne|first=Eric, J.|title=Putting the Caliph in His Place: Power, Authority, and the Late Abbasid Caliphate|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838641132|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During al-Qadir's Caliphate, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] looked after the empire. Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered the Sunni struggle against Shiʿism and outlawed heresies such as the [[Baghdad Manifesto]] and the doctrine that the Quran was created. He outlawed the [[Muʿtazila]], bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim philosophy. During this and the next period, [[Islamic literature]], especially [[Persian literature]], flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Muir]]. The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1000, the global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 percent of the world, compared to the Christian population of 10 percent.

During [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Al-Qa'im]]'s reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty gained power. [[Toghrül]] overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In [[Bahrain]], the Qarmatian state collapsed in [[Al-Hasa]]. Arabia recovered from the Fatimids and again acknowledged the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids. [[Al-Muqtadi]] was honored by the Seljuq Sultan [[Malik-Shah I]], during whose reign the Caliphate was recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuq conquest. The Sultan was critical of the Caliph's interference in affairs of state, but died before deposing the last of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Riley-Smith, The Oxford History of the Crusades, (Oxford University Press, 2002), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Late Baghdad Abbasids reigned from the beginning of the [[Crusades]] to the [[Seventh Crusade]]. The first Caliph was [[Al-Mustazhir]]. He was politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the [[First Crusade]] in Syria. [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. [[Jerusalem]] was captured by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] from the ''[[Franks]]'' (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war against the [[infidel]]. Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Muir]], The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Mustarshid]] achieved more independence while the sultan [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq]] was engaged in war in the East. The [[Bani Assad|Banu Mazyad]] (Mazyadid State) general, Dubays ibn Sadaqa&lt;ref&gt;ʻIzz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr, Donald Sidney Richards, ''The chronicle of Ibn al-Athīr for the crusading period from al-Kāmil fī'l-ta'rīkh: The years 491–541/1097–1146 : the coming of the Franks and the Muslim response''.&lt;/ref&gt; (emir of [[Al-Hilla]]), plundered [[Bosra]] and attacked Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, [[Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud]]. Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], founder of the [[Zengid dynasty]]. Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlWsMcwZ9vEC|date= 2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the siege of Damascus (1134),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Richard, The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 1. 1979. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Zengi undertook [[Military history of the Crusader states#War with the Zengids|operations in Syria]]. Al-Mustarshid attacked sultan Mas'ud of western Seljuq and was taken prisoner. He was later found murdered.&lt;ref&gt;It is supposed by an emissary of the [[Hashshashins]], who had no love for the Caliph. Modern historians have suspected that Mas'ud instigated the murder although the two most important historians of the period Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Jawzi did not speculate on this matter.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Al-Rashid (12th century)|Al-Rashid]] failed to gain independence from Seljuq Turks. Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his uncle, son of [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Muqtafi]], appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to [[Isfahan]] and was killed by Hashshashins.&lt;ref&gt;William Muir. book The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued disunion and contests between Seljuq Turks allowed al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] patriarch [[Abdisho III]]. While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1157)]]. The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the Crusaders.

The next caliph, [[Al-Mustanjid]], saw [[Saladin]] extinguish the [[Fatimid dynasty]] after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. [[Al-Mustadi]] reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the Abbasids.

[[An-Nasir]], "''The Victor for the Religion of God''", attempted to restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven year reign was chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his dynasty. His son, [[Az-Zahir (Abbasid caliph)|Az-Zahir]], was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson, [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]], was made caliph.

Al-Mustansir founded the [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]]. In 1236 [[Ögedei Khan]] commanded to raise up [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]]&lt;!-- what does "to raise up" mean here?--&gt; and populated [[Herat]]. The Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in [[Mughan plain]], Azerbaijan. The rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Cilician Armenia]] surrendered. Chormaqan divided the [[Transcaucasia]] region into three districts based on military hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigor of Akanc-The history of the nation of archers, (tr. R.P.Blake) 303&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, the population were temporarily divided into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalistriat Salia-History of the Georguan Nation, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia, excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Ismaili]] strongholds, and all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Thomas (2004) ''Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|052160270X}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Musta'sim]] was the last Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad and is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. To the east, Mongol forces under [[Hulagu Khan]] swept through the [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad was sacked]] and the caliph deposed soon afterwards. The Mamluk sultans and Syria later appointed a powerless Abbasid Caliph in Cairo.

The Abbasid "shadow" caliph of Cairo reigned under the tutelage of the [[Mamluk]] sultans and nominal rulers used to legitimize the actual rule of the Mamluk sultans. All the Cairene Abbasid caliphs who preceded or succeeded [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in]] were spiritual heads lacking any temporal power. Al-Musta'in was the only Cairo-based Abbasid caliph to even briefly hold political power. [[Al-Mutawakkil III]] was the last "shadow" caliph.

The [[Fatimids]] originated in [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]] and eastern [[Algeria]]). The dynasty was founded in 909 by [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah|ʻAbdullāh al-Mahdī Billah]], who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter [[Fatimah|Fātima as-Zahra]] and her husband [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|ʻAlī ibn-Abī-Tālib]], the first Shīʻa [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imām]], hence the name ''al-Fātimiyyūn'' "Fatimid".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr. A Concise History of the Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatamids and the [[Zaydis]] at the time, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as did most Sunnis.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahmoud A.

Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from [[Mahdia]], his capital in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm Mahdia: Historical Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109154752/http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm |date=2013-11-09 }}".

The Fatimids entered Egypt in the late 10th century, conquering the [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] and founding a capital at ''al-Qāhira''([[Cairo]]) in 969.&lt;ref name="Beeson 24, 26–30"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm |title=Cairo, a Millennial |accessdate=2007-08-09 |first=Irene |last=Beeson |pages=24, 26–30 |date=September–October 1969 |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930163720/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to the planet Mars, "The Subduer", which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in cities such as [[Fustat]] until 1169.  After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to conquer surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria and even crossed the Mediterranean into Sicily and southern Italy.

Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Yemen and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, R. (2008). An introduction to Islam for Jews. Philadelphia: JPS/Jewish Publication Society. Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its [[Song dynasty]], which determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]].

Unlike other governments in the area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was based more on merit than heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, including Sunnis, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance covered non-Muslims such as Christians and Jews; they took high levels in government based on ability.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, J.-E., Redissi, H., &amp; Ṣaydāwī, R. (2009). Religion and politics: Islam and Muslim civilization. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub. Company. Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, notably [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]].

The Fatimid palace was in two parts. It was in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area at Bin El-Quasryn street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm Cairo_of_the_mind, oldroads.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092655/http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |date=2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::''Also see'': [[Muslim history#Cairo Abbasid Caliphs|Cairo Abbasid Caliphs]] (above)

During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Fatimid Caliphs claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt, but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence. Subsequently, they traveled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al Mahdi. A system of government helped update Al Mahdi on the development which took place in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Melvill Gwatkin|author2=James Pounder Whitney|author3=Joseph Robson Tanner |author4=Charles William Previté-Orton |author5=Zachary Nugent Brooke|title=The Cambridge Medieval History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiuSGrFt32gC&amp;pg=PA379|year=1913|publisher=Macmillan|pages=379–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Islamic Cairo" building was named after [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], built by Fatimid vizier [[Gawhar Al-Siqilli]], and extended by [[Badr al-Jamali]].]]
Al Mahdi [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] established the first [[Imam]] of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under [[Aghlabid]] rule. His success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a suburb of [[Al-Qayrawan]] in Tunisia. In 920, Al Mahdi took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, [[Al-Mahdiyyah]]. After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.mumineen.org/awliya/aimmat/e_imamqaim.html al-Qaim bi-Amrillah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210105748/http://archive.mumineen.org/awliya/aimmat/e_imamqaim.html |date=2006-02-10 }}. archive.mumineen.org&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death he had extended his reign to Morocco of the [[Idrisids]], as well as Egypt itself.The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include [[Sicily]] and to stretch across [[North Africa]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Libya]].{{sfn|Yeomans|2006|p=44}} Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]], which he ruled from [[Mahdia]], in Tunisia. Newly built capital [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Al-Mansuriya]],{{efn|The name ''Mansuriyya'' means "the victorious", after its founder Ismāʿīl Abu Tahir Ismail Billah, called ''al-Mansur'', "the victor."{{sfn|Tracy|2000|p=234}} }} or Mansuriyya ({{lang-ar|المنصوريه }}), near [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], was the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate during the rules of the Imams [[Al-Mansur Billah]] (r. 946–953) and [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]] (r. 953–975).

The Fatimid general Jawhar conquered Egypt in 969, and he built a new palace city there, near Fusṭāt, which he also called al-Manṣūriyya. Under [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah]], the Fatimids conquered the [[Ikhshidid Wilayah]] (see [[Fatimid Egypt]]), founding a new capital at ''al-Qāhira'' ([[Cairo]]) in 969.&lt;ref name="Beeson 24, 26–30"/&gt; The name was a reference to the planet Mars, "The Subduer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Cairo.htm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521030532/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Cairo.htm |archivedate=2016-05-21 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started.

Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak [[North Africa]], Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], Syria, the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, [[Tihamah]], [[Hejaz]], and [[Yemen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to [[China]] and its [[Song Dynasty]], which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]].

After the eighteenth Imam, [[al-Mustansir Billah]], the Nizari sect believed that his son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] was his successor, while another Ismāʿīlī branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually descend), supported his other son, [[al-Musta'li]].  The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, [[al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah]] (1132). At the death of Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the imamate to his son [[at-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]], who was then two years old.
After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the [[Zengid]] ruler [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nūr ad-Dīn]] had his general, [[Shirkuh]], seized Egypt from the vizier [[Shawar]] in 1169. Shirkuh died two months after taking power, and the rule went to his nephew, [[Saladin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Amin Maalouf|year=1984|title=The Crusades Through Arab Eyes|publisher=Al Saqi Books|pages=160–70|isbn=978-0-8052-0898-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This began the [[Ayyubid Dynasty|Ayyubid Sultanate of Egypt and Syria]].

Beginning in the 8th century, the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Iberian Christian kingdoms]] had begun the [[Reconquista]] aimed at retaking Al-Andalus from the Moors. In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]], inspired by the conquests in Spain by Christian forces and implored by the [[Alexios I Komnenos|eastern Roman emperor]] to help defend Christianity in the East, called for the [[First Crusade]] from Western Europe which captured [[Edessa]], [[Antioch]], [[County of Tripoli]] and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Hallam|title=View of the State of Europe During the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=1870|publisher=W. J. Widdleton|pages=49–|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of the Crusades, the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] emerged and for a time controlled Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other smaller [[Crusader kingdoms]] over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the [[Levant]], but did not threaten the Islamic Caliphate nor other powers in the region. After [[Shirkuh]] ended Fatimid rule in 1169, uniting it with Syria, the Crusader kingdoms were faced with a threat, and his nephew Saladin reconquered most of the area in 1187, leaving the Crusaders holding a few ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=5|title=The Literary Era: A Monthly Repository of Literary and Miscellaneous Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjHZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA133|year=1898|publisher=Porter &amp; Coates|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Third Crusade]] armies from Europe failed to recapture Jerusalem, though Crusader states lingered for several decades, and other crusades followed. The Christian Reconquista continued in Al-Andalus, and was eventually completed with the [[Granada War|fall of Granada]] in 1492. During the low period of the Crusades, the [[Fourth Crusade]] was diverted from the Levant and instead took [[Constantinople]], leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (now the Byzantine Empire) further weakened in their long struggle against the [[Turkish peoples]] to the east. However, the crusaders did manage to damage Islamic caliphates; according to [[William of Malmesbury]], preventing them from further expansion into [[Christendom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sylvia Schein|title=Gateway to the Heavenly City: Crusader Jerusalem and the Catholic West (1099–1187)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaqY_g4i_ukC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0649-9|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being targets of the Mamluks and the Mongols.

===Ayyubid dynasty===
{{Main|Ayyubid dynasty}}
[[File:Ayyubid Sultanate 1193 AD.jpg|thumb|Ayyubid empire]]The [[Ayyubid dynasty]] was founded by [[Saladin]] and centered in Egypt. In 1174, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan and conquered the Near East region. The Ayyubids ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. After Saladin, his sons contested control over the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself in 1200. In the 1230s, Syria's Ayyubid rulers attempted to win independence from Egypt and remained divided until Egyptian Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, excluding [[Aleppo]], by 1247. In 1250, the dynasty in the Egyptian region was overthrown by slave regiments. A number of attempts to recover it failed, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid territories soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Lock|title=The Routledge Companion to the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkCKZ9Hs4-QC&amp;pg=PA180+|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-13137-1|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mongol invasions and conquests}}

After the Crusades the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]] invaded in the 13th century, marking the end of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Some historians assert that the eastern Islamic world never fully recovered. Under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], The Mongols put an end to the Abbasid era. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] began in 1219 at a huge cost in civilian life and economic devastation. The Mongols spread throughout Central Asia and Persia: the Persian city of [[Isfahan]] had fallen to them by 1237.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/ilkhanate.html The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Il-Khanate)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015081646/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/ilkhanate.html |date=2013-10-15 }}. ucalgary.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

With the election of Khan [[Möngke Khan|Mongke]] in 1251, Mongol targeted the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. Mongke's brother, [[Hulegu]], was made leader of the [[Mongol Army]] assigned to the task of subduing Baghdad. The [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Bagdhad]] in 1258 destroyed what had been the largest city in Islam.  The last Abbasid caliph, [[al-Musta'sim]], was captured and killed; and Baghdad was ransacked and destroyed. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo fell in 1260. Plans for the conquest of Egypt were delayed due to the death of Mongke at around the same time. The Abbasid army lost to the superior Mongol army, but the invaders were finally stopped by Egyptian Mamluks north of Jerusalem in 1260 at the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]].&lt;ref&gt;Tschanz, David W.

===Mamluk Sultanate===
{{Main|Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)}}

[[File:Bahri Dynasty 1250 - 1382 (AD).PNG|thumb|Mamluk empire and Mongol Ilkhanate]]

In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by slave regiments, and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was born. Military prestige was at the center of Mamluk society, and it played a key role in the confrontations with the Mongol forces. In the 1260s, the Mongols sacked and controlled the Islamic Near East territories. The Mamluks, who were [[Turkic people|Turkic]], forced out the Mongols (see [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]) after the final destruction of the Ayyubid dynasty. The Mongols were again defeated by the Mamluks at the [[First Battle of Homs|Battle of Hims]] a few months later, and then driven out of Syria altogether.&lt;ref name="AHGC" /&gt; With this, the Mamluks were able to concentrate their forces and to conquer the last of the crusader territories in the Levant. Thus they united Syria and Egypt for the longest interval between the Abbasid and Ottoman empires (1250–1517).&lt;ref name="Hourani"&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mamluks experienced a continual state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition between the "Muslim territory" ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Dar al-Islam]]) and "non-Muslim territory" ([[Dar al-Harb]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. New Edition. Brill, Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their chosen role as defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, the Mamluks sponsored many religious buildings, including mosques, [[madrasas]] and [[khanqah]]s. Though some construction took place in the provinces, the vast bulk of these projects expanded the capital. Many Mamluk buildings in Cairo have survived to this day, particularly in Old Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;For more, see [[Mamluk architecture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Taifa}}

The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]], first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in [[Hispania]]. Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] was defeated and killed on July 19 at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]] crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain [[Ṭārif]] in 710 and also, the Ad Sebastianum recension of the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'', refers to an Arab attack incited by [[Erwig]] during the reign of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]] (672–80). The two large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought.&lt;ref name=Collins2004139&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2004|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of [[Emir]] by the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] in [[Damascus]]. After the [[Abbasids]] came to power, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler [[Abd al-Rahman III]] took over the title of ''[[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliph of Córdoba]]''(912-961).&lt;ref name="Hourani 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state with its capital as [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. [[Al-Hakam II]] succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glubb |first=John Bagot|authorlink=|others= |title=The course of empire: The Arabs and their successors |origyear=|url=|format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=|language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=128 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glick |first=Thomas F. |authorlink= |others= |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the early Middle Ages |origyear=|url= |format=|accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2005|publisher=BRILL|location= |language=|isbn=978-90-04-14771-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=102 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.

[[Abd al-Rahman I]] and Bedr (a former Greek slave) escaped with their lives after the popular revolt known as the [[Abbasid Revolution]].

Rahman I and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah]] torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders – [[Obeid Allah ibn Uthman]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Khalid]], both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at [[Almuñécar]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[Málaga]].

During his brief time in Málaga, he quickly amassed local support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to [[Zaragoza#Moorish Saraqusta|control Zaragoza]]. Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir river]], just outside Córdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah). Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their army. Rahman I marched into the capital, Córdoba, fighting off a [[counterattack]], but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not claim the Muslim caliph, though.&lt;ref&gt;This was likely because al-Andalus was a land besieged by many different loyalties, and the proclamation of caliph would have likely caused much unrest. Abd al-Rahman's progeny would, however, take up the title of caliph.&lt;/ref&gt; The last step was to have al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, garroted in Córdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for the house of Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hamilton Morgan. Lost History: The Enduring Legacy of Muslim Scientists, Thinkers, and Artists. National Geographic Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]] had planned to depose the emir. Rahman I and his army confronted the Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated rebellions in al-Andalus. He began the building of the great mosque [cordova], and formed ship-yards along the coast; he is moreover said to have been the first to transplant the palm and the pomegranate into the congenial climate of Spain: and he encouraged science and literature in his states. He died on 29 September 788, after a reign of thirty-four years and one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns5PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA385|year=1839|publisher=C.

[[File:Lamezquitacordoba.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the Mezquita.]]
Rahman I's successor was his son [[Hisham I]]. Born in Córdoba, he built many [[mosque]]s and completed the [[Mezquita]]. He called for a [[jihad]] that resulted in a campaign against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and the [[County of Toulouse]]; in this second campaign he was defeated at Orange by [[William of Gellone]], first cousin to [[Charlemagne]]. His successor [[Al-Hakam I]] came to power and was challenged by his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of Charlemagne in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] to negotiate for aid. In the mean time Córdoba was attacked, but was defended. Hakam I spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and Mérida.&lt;ref&gt;P{{cite book|author1=P. M.

[[Abd ar-Rahman II]] succeeded his father and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted. Rahman II repulsed an assault by [[Vikings]] who had disembarked in [[Cádiz]], conquered [[Seville]] (with the exception of its [[citadel]]) and attacked Córdoba. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids.  He responded to [[William of Septimania]]'s requests of assistance in his struggle against [[Charles the Bald]]'s nominations.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]]'s reign was marked by the movements of the [[Muladi]] (ethnic Iberian Muslims) and [[Mozarab]]s (Muslim-Iberia Christians). Muhammad I was succeeded by his son [[Al-Mundhir of Córdoba|Mundhir I]]. During the reign of his father, Mundhir I commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muladi rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During his two-year reign, Mundhir I fought against [[Umar ibn Hafsun]]. He died in 888 at Bobastro, succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]].

Umawi showed no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muladi. His power as emir was confined to the area of Córdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's brothers. The latter was in turn executed by Umawi's father, who named as successor [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], son of the killed son of Umawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maribel |last=Fierro|title=Abd-al-Rahman III of Córdoba|location=Oxford|publisher=Oneworld Publications|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-85168-384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ibn Idhari]] |others=trans.

==Islam in Africa==
{{main|Muslim conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Islamization of the Sudan region|Shirazi era|Migration to Abyssinia|Swahili Coast}}
The [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]] continued the century of rapid Muslim military expansion following the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632. By 640 the Arabs controlled [[Mesopotamia]], had invaded [[Armenia]], and were concluding their conquest of [[Byzantine Syria]]. [[Damascus]] was the seat of the [[Umayyad caliphate]]. By the end of 641 all of [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] was in Arab hands. A subsequent attempt to conquer the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]] was however repelled.

===Maghreb===
[[File:Kairouan's Great Mosque courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] also known as the Mosque of Uqba was established in 670 by the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi, it is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb, situated in the city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]
{{Main|Greater Maghreb}}

[[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] was the first city founded by Muslims in the [[Maghreb]]. Arab general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] erected the city (in 670) and, in the same time, the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=1176|title=Kairouan Capital of Political Power and Learning in the Ifriqiya |publisher= Muslim Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered as the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the western Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&amp;pg=PA264|date=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|pages=264–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This part of Islamic territory has had independent governments during most of Islamic history. The [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid]] were the first Arab rulers in the western [[Maghreb]] (Morocco), ruling from 788 to 985. The dynasty is named after its first [[sultan]] [[Idris I]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. Benhima, "[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=867&amp;lang=en The Idrisids (789–974)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610132109/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=867&amp;lang=en |date=10 June 2013 }}".

The [[Almoravid dynasty]] was a Berber dynasty from the [[Sahara]] flourished over a wide area of North-Western Africa and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the 11th century. Under this dynasty the [[Moorish]] empire was extended over present-day Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Gibraltar, [[Tlemcen]] (in Algeria) and a part of what is now [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]] in the south, and Spain and Portugal in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Almoravides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Almohad Dynasty]] or "the Unitarians", were a Berber Muslim religious power which founded the fifth [[Moorish]] dynasty in the 12th century, and conquered all Northern Africa as far as Egypt, together with Al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Almonades, Reinhart Dozy, Second edition, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:Zeila ruins.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|Ruins of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), Somalia.]]
{{main|Islam in Ethiopia|Islam in Somalia}}

The history of Islam in the [[Horn of Africa]] is almost as old as the faith itself. Through extensive trade and social interactions with their converted Muslim trading partners on the other side of the [[Red Sea]], in the [[Arabian peninsula]], merchants and sailors in the Horn region gradually came under the influence of the new religion.&lt;ref name="Sct"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic disciples fled to the port city of [[Zeila]] in modern-day northern [[Somalia]] to seek protection from the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] at the court of the [[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite Emperor]] in present-day Somalia. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the Red Sea came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.&lt;ref name="Sct"/&gt;

===Great Lakes===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0232, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Arabische Moschee.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]]]]

Islam came to the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of South Eastern Africa along existing trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P.-J. (2004). Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal cultural corridor in the western Indian Ocean, 1799–1856. Leiden: Brill. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; They learned from them the manners of the Muslims and this led to their conversion by the Muslim Arabs.

Local Islamic governments centered in [[Islam in Tanzania|Tanzania]] (then [[Zanzibar]]). The people of ''[[Zayd]]'' were Muslims that immigrated to the Great Lakes region. In the pre-colonial period, the structure of Islamic authority here was held up through the ''[[Ulema]]'' (''wanawyuonis'', in [[Swahili language]]). These leaders had some degree of authority over most of the Muslims in South East Africa before territorial boundaries were established. The chief [[Qadi]] there was recognized for having the final religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nimtz, Jr. |first=August H.  |authorlink= |others= |title=Islam and Politics in East Aftrica. the Sufi Order in Tanzania |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam in East and South Asia==
===Southeast Asia===
[[File:Masjid demak.jpg|thumb|200px|Grand Mosque of [[Sultanate of Demak|Demak]], the first Muslim state in Java]]
{{See also|The spread of Islam in Indonesia (1200 to 1600)}}

Islam first reached [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] through traders from Mecca in the 7th century,&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt; particularly via the western part of what is now [[Indonesia]]. Arab traders from Yemen already had a presence in Asia through trading and traveling by sea, serving as intermediary traders to and from Europe and Africa. They traded not only Arabian goods but also goods from Africa, India, and so on which included ivory, fragrances, spices, and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Le Bon. (1956). ''Hadarat al Arab''. Translation of La Civilisation-des Arabes. 3rd Print. Cairo. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to T.W. Arnold in ''The Preaching of Islam'', by the 2nd century of the Islamic Calendar, Arab traders had been trading with the inhabitants of [[Ceylon]], modern-day Sri Lanka. The same argument has been told by Dr. B.H. Burger and Dr. Mr. Prajudi in ''Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia'' (History of Socio Economic of Indonesia)&lt;ref&gt;Suryanegara, Ahmad Mansyur. (2009). ''Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia'' (History of Socio Economic of Indonesia). API Sejarah. Bandung. Indonesia. pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; According to an atlas created by the geographer Al-Biruni (973–1048), the Indian or Indonesian Ocean used to be called the Persian Ocean. After Western Imperialist rule, this name was changed to reflect the name used today; the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Arnold and Alfred Guilaume, (eds.), (1965). ''The Legacy of Islam''. Oxford University Press, New York, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, many [[Sufi]] missionaries translated classical [[Sufi literature]] from Arabic and Persian into [[Malay language|Malay]]; a tangible product of this is the [[Jawi script]]. Coupled with the composing of original [[Islamic literature]] in Malay, this led the way to the transformation of Malay into an Islamic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1292, when [[Marco Polo]] visited Sumatra, most of the inhabitants had converted to Islam. The [[Sultanate of Malacca]] was founded on the [[Malay Peninsula]] by [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], a [[Srivijaya]]n Prince.

Through trade and commerce, Islam then spread to [[Borneo]] and [[Java]]. By the late 15th century, [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] had been introduced to the [[Philippines]] via the southern island of [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&amp;pg=PA419|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|pages=419–|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foremost{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} socio-cultural Muslim entities that resulted form this are the present-day [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]; Islamised kingdoms in the northern [[Luzon]] island, such as the [[Kingdom of Maynila]] and the [[Kingdom of Tondo]], were later conquered and [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] with the majority of the archipelago by [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonisers]] beginning in the 16th century.

As Islam spread, societal changes developed from the individual conversions, and five centuries later it emerged as a dominant cultural and political power in the region. Three main Muslim political powers emerged. The [[Aceh Sultanate]] was the most important, controlling much of the area between Southeast Asia and India from its centre in northern [[Sumatra]]. The Sultanate also attracted [[Sufi poetry|Sufi poets]]. The second Muslim power was the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay Peninsula. The [[Demak Sultanate|Sultanate of Demak]] on Java was the third power, where the emerging Muslim forces defeated the local [[Majapahit]] kingdom in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=226–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sultanate managed to expand its territory somewhat, its rule remained brief.&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;

[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] forces captured Malacca in 1511 under naval general [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. With Malacca subdued, the [[Aceh Sultanate]] and [[Bruneian Empire]] established themselves as centres of Islam in Southeast Asia. The Sultanate's territory, although vastly diminished, remains intact to this day as the modern state of [[Brunei Darussalam]].&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;

===Indian Subcontinent===
[[File:Qutb minar ruins.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The [[Qutub Minar]] ([[Delhi Sultanate]])]]
{{Main|Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent}}

On the [[Indian subcontinent]], Islam first appeared in the southwestern tip of the peninsula, in today's [[Kerala]] state. Arabs traded with [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] even before the birth of Muhammad. Native legends say that a group of [[Sahaba]], under [[Malik Bin Deenar|Malik Ibn Deenar]], arrived on the [[Malabar Coast]] and preached Islam. According to that legend, [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|the first mosque of India]] was built by [[Kulasekhara|Second Chera]] King [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara|Cheraman Perumal]], who accepted Islam and received the name ''Tajudheen''. He traveled to Arabia to meet Muhammad and died on the trip back, somewhere in today's [[Oman]]. Historical records suggest that the [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|Cheraman Perumal Mosque]] was built in around 629.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web

Islamic rule came to the Indian subcontinent in the 8th century, when [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered [[Sindh]]. Muslim conquests expanded under [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] and the [[Ghaznavids]] until the late 12th century, when the [[Ghurids]] overran the Ghaznavids and extended the conquests in Northern India.

In China, four Sahabas (Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas, Wahb Abu Kabcha, [[Jafar ibn Abu Talib]] and [[Jahsh ibn Riyab]]) preached in 616/17 and onwards after following the [[Chittagong]]&amp;ndash;[[Kamrup region|Kamrup]]&amp;ndash;[[Manipur]] route after sailing from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in 615/16. After conquering Persia in 636, Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas went with [[Sa'id ibn Zaid]], [[Qais ibn Sa'd]] and [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] to China in 637 taking the complete Quran. Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas headed for China for the third time in 650–51 after Caliph Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor received.&lt;ref&gt;Khamouch, Mohammed.

== Early Modern period==
{{main|Early modern history}}
In the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Middle East, the [[Balkans]] and [[Northern Africa]]; the [[Safavid Empire]] in [[Greater Iran]]; and the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration.&lt;ref name="Armstrong116"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|2000|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:OttomanEmpire1590.png|thumb|left|The Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent in the Middle East.]]

The Seljuq Turks declined in the second half of the 13th century, after the [[Mongol conquest of Anatolia|Mongol invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977a|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of multiple Turkish principalities, known as [[bey]]liks. [[Osman I]], the founder of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], assumed leadership of one of these principalities ([[Söğüt]]) at the end of the thirteenth century, succeeding his father [[Ertuğrul]]. Osman I afterwards led it in a series of battles with the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, G. C. (2006). Dictionary of wars. New York: Facts on File. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1331, the Ottomans had captured [[Nicaea]], the former Byzantine capital, under the leadership of Osman's son and successor, [[Orhan I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] against the [[Serb]]s in 1389 then facilitated their expansion into Europe. The Ottomans were established in the [[Balkans]] and Anatolia by the time [[Bayezid I]] ascended to power in the same year, now at the helm of a growing empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth halted when Mongol warlord [[Timur]] (also known as "''Tamerlane''") captured Bayezid I in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, beginning the [[Ottoman Interregnum]]. This episode was characterized by the division of the Ottoman territory amongst Bayezid I's sons, who submitted to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] authority. When a number of Ottoman territories regained independent status, ruin for the Empire loomed. However, the empire recovered, as the youngest son of Bayezid I, [[Mehmed I]], waged offensive campaigns against his ruling brothers, thereby reuniting [[Asia Minor]] and declaring himself sultan in 1413.&lt;ref name="AHGC"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Applied History Research Group |publisher=University of Calagary |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/index2.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600 |accessdate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410125136/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/index2.html |archivedate=2007-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:View of the Süleymaniye Mosque from the Bosphorus (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Suleiman Mosque]] (Süleymaniye Camii) in [[Istanbul]] was built on the order of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in 1557]]
Around this time the Ottoman [[Navy|naval]] fleet developed, such that they were able to challenge [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], a [[naval power]]. They also attempted to reconquer the Balkans. By the time of Mehmed I's grandson, [[Mehmed II]] (ruled 1444–1446; 1451–1481), the Ottomans could lay siege to [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium. A factor in this siege was the use of [[muskets]] and large [[cannon]]s introduced by the Ottomans. The Byzantine fortress [[Fall of Constantinople|succumbed]] in 1453, after 54 days of siege. Without its capital the Byzantine Empire disintegrated.&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt; The future successes of the Ottomans and later empires would depend upon the exploitation of [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong116"/&gt;

In the early 16th century, the Shi'ite [[Safavid dynasty]] assumed control in Persia under the leadership of [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]], defeating the ruling [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] federation [[Aq Qoyunlu]] (also called the "White Sheep Turkomans") in 1501. The Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] sought to repel Safavid expansion, challenging and defeating them at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514. Selim I also deposed the ruling Mamluks in Egypt, absorbing their territories in 1517. [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] (also known as ''Suleiman the Magnificent''), Selim I's successor, took advantage of the diversion of Safavid focus to the [[Uzbeks]] on the eastern frontier and recaptured Baghdad, which had fallen under Safavid control. Despite this, Safavid power remained substantial, rivalling the Ottomans. Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526 — [[Siege of Vienna|reaching as far as the gates of Vienna]] thereafter, and signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with [[Francis I of France]] against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] 10 years later. While Suleiman I's rule (1520–1566) is often identified as the apex of Ottoman power, the empire continued to remain powerful and influential until a relative fall in its military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor  |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Introduction |date=2009 |page=xxxii}}

Major evidence of decline was not visible before the second half of the eighteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safavid Empire===
{{Main|Safavids}}
[[File:Safavid Empire 1501 1722 AD.png|thumb|left|Safavid empire]]

The [[Safavid dynasty]] rose to power in [[Tabriz]] in 1501 and later conquered the rest of Iran. The Safavids were originally Sufi and Iran was Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Golden (2002) "An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples"; In: Osman Karatay, Ankara, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; After their defeat at the hands of the Sunni Ottomans at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]], to unite the Persians behind him [[Ismail I]] made conversion mandatory for the largely Sunni population to Twelver Shia so that he could get them to fight the Sunni Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;"Ismail Safavi" Encyclopædia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]]. [[Zaydis]], the largest group amongst the Shia before the [[Safavid Dynasty]] were also forced to convert to the Twelver Shia. The [[Zaydis]] at that time used the Hanafi Fiqh, as did most Sunnis and there were good relations between them. [[Abu Hanifah]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] were also very good friends.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arab-Israeli Conflict Page 917"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Iraq Effect Page 91"/&gt;

The [[Safavids]] dynasty from [[Azarbaijan]] ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which established [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] Islam as the region's [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|official religion]] and united its provinces under a single sovereignty, thereby reigniting the [[History of Iran|Persian]] identity.

Note the two [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] figures with their names at the top left.]]
Although claiming to be the descendants of [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the Safavids were [[Sunni]] (the name "Safavid" comes from a Sufi order called ''Safavi''). Their origins go back to [[Firuz Shah Zarrinkolah]], a local dignitary from the north. During their rule, the Safavids recognized Twelver Shi'a Islam as the State religion, thus giving the region a separate identity from its Sunni neighbours.

In 1524, [[Tahmasp I]] acceded to the throne, initiating a revival of the arts. [[Persian carpet|Carpetmaking]] became a major industry. The tradition of [[Persian miniature]] painting in manuscripts reached its peak, until Tahmasp turned to strict religious observance in middle age, prohibiting the consumption of alcohol and [[hashish]] and removing [[casino]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[brothel]]s.  Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] continued to patronize a last flowering of the arts until he was murdered, after which many artists were recruited by the Mughal dynasty.

Tahmasp's grandson, [[Shah Abbas I]], restored the shrine of the eighth Twelver Shi'a Imam, [[Ali al-Ridha]] at [[Mashhad]], and restored the dynastic shrine at [[Ardabil]]. Both shrines received jewelry, fine manuscripts and Chinese porcelains. Abbas moved the capital to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], revived old ports, and established thriving trade with Europeans. Amongst Abbas's most visible cultural achievements was the construction of ''[[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]]'' ("Design of the World"). The plaza, located near a Friday mosque, covered {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=199–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Safavid Dynasty]] was toppled in 1722 by the [[Hotaki dynasty]], which ended their forceful conversion of Sunni areas to Shiaism.

===Mughal Empire===
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}
[[File:The Mughal Empire.jpg|thumb|left|Mughal empire]]
The Mughal Empire was a product of various [[Central Asia]]n invasions into the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was founded by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Babur]] in 1526 with the destruction of the [[Delhi sultanate]], placing its capital in [[Agra]]. Babur's death some years later and the indecisive rule of his son, [[Humayun]], brought instability to Mughal rule. The resistance of the [[Afghanistan|Afghani]] [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]], who administered a string of defeats to Humayun, weakened the empire. A year before his death, however, Humayun managed to recover much of the lost territories, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, the 13-year-old [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] (later known as ''Akbar the Great''), in 1556.[[File:Taj Mahal (south view, 2006).jpg|right|thumb|The Taj Mahal]] Under Akbar, consolidation of the Mughal Empire occurred through both expansion and administrative reforms.  After Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan came to power. Subsequently, Aurangazeb ruled vast areas including Afghanisthan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "odpftr"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=211–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire ruled most of present-day India, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Afghanistan]] for several centuries. Its decline in the early 18th century allowed India to be divided into smaller kingdoms and states. The Mughal dynasty was dissolved by the [[British Empire]] after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "odpftr"/&gt; It left a lasting legacy on Indian culture and architecture. Famous buildings built by the Mughals, include: the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Red Fort]], the [[Badshahi Mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort]], the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] and the [[Agra Fort]]. During the empire's reign, Muslim communities flourished all over India, in [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]] and [[Hyderabad district (India)|Hyderabad]]. Various Sufi orders from Afghanistan and Persia were active throughout the region. More than a quarter of the population converted to Islam.&lt;ref name = "odpftr"/&gt;

== Modern period ==
The modern age brought technological and organizational changes to Europe while the Islamic region continued the patterns of earlier centuries. The European powers, and especially [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], globalized economically and colonized much of the region.

=== Ottoman Empire partition ===
{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S29571, Türkei, Dardanellen, MG-Stellung.jpg|thumb|Ottoman army in World War I]] 
By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had declined. The decision to back [[Germany]] in [[World War I]] meant they shared the [[Central Powers]]' defeat in that war. The defeat led to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious general of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]: [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who became known to his people as Atatürk, "Father of the Turks." Atatürk was credited with renegotiating the [[treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in the war and establishing the modern [[Republic of Turkey]], which was recognized by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. Atatürk went on to implement an ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and [[secular]]ization. He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws, adopted [[Arabic numerals]], the [[Latin script]], separated the religious establishment from the state, and emancipated woman—even giving them the right to vote in parallel with [[women's suffrage]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=961, 969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War I, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was handed over to the victorious European powers as [[protectorate]]s. During the war the Allies had promised the subject peoples independence in exchange for their assistance fighting the Turkish powers. To their dismay, they found that this system of "protectorates" was a smoke-screen for their continued subjugation by the British and the French. The struggles for independence from their Turkish overlords and the cooperation of partisan forces with the British were romanticized in the stories of British secret intelligence agent [[T. E. Lawrence]]—later known as "Lawrence of Arabia."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=971–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman successor states include today's [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], Egypt, Greece, Iraq, [[Israel]], Lebanon, [[Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Serbia]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Turkey, Balkan states, North Africa and the north shore of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNeill|Bentley|Christian|2005|p=1402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslim countries sought to adopt European political organization and [[nationalism]] began to emerge in the Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their governments and sought to develop national pride among their citizens. Other places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.

Some Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as [[Wahabism]], which found its way into the [[Saudi royal family]].

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
{{Main|Arab–Israeli conflict}}
The Arab–Israeli conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It involves the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] as a [[Jew]]ish [[nation state]], the consequent [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], as well as the adverse relationship between the [[Arab]] states and the State of Israel (see related [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]). Despite at first involving only the Arab states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between Israel and other predominantly [[Muslim world|Muslim states]].

The [[Six-Day War]] of June 5–10, 1967, was fought between [[Israel]] and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Arab countries closed the [[Suez canal]] and it was followed in May 1970 by the closure of the "tapline" from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These developments had the effect of increasing the importance of [[petroleum]] in [[Libya]], which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe. In 1970, [[Occidental Petroleum]] broke with other oil companies and accepted the Arab demands for price increases.

Many countries, individuals and [[non-governmental organizations]] elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, [[Arab culture]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Jewish culture]], or for ideological, [[human rights]], or strategic reasons. Although some consider the Arab–Israeli conflict a part of (or a precursor to) a wider [[clash of civilizations]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Muslim world]],&lt;ref&gt;Causes Of Anti-Americanism in the Arab World: a Socio-Political perspective [http://www.rubincenter.org/meria/2003/12/abdallah.pdf] by Abdel Mahdi Abdallah (MERIA Journal).

In 1979 the [[Iranian Revolution]] transformed [[Iran]] from a constitutional monarchy to a [[Populism|populist]] [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamic republic]] under the rule of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], a Shi'i Muslim cleric and ''[[Marja'|marja]]''. Following the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a referendum established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as [[Supreme Leader]]. During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought each other, and the Islamics captured power.

The development of the two opposite fringes, the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]] the Twelver Shia version and its reinforcement by the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Salafi]] in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the [[Iran–Saudi Arabia relations]] resulted in these governments using sectarian conflict to enhance their political interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heather S.

Oxford: Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-78096-221-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], as they feared that an Islamic revolution would take place within their own borders. Certain Iranian exiles also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse.

In October 1973, a new war between Israel and its Muslim neighbors, known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], broke out just as the oil companies began meeting with [[OPEC]] leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the success of [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat's]] campaigns and the war strengthened their unity. In response to the emergency resupply effort by the [[Western Bloc|West]] that enabled Israel to put up a resistance against the Egyptian and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use some of its oil wealth to finance the "front-line states", those that bordered Israel, in their struggle. The centrality of petroleum, the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant features of the politics of the region.

[[File:Index of Economic Freedom 2018.png|thumb|400px|right|The 2018 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom overall heatmap]]
The '''''Index of Economic Freedom''''' is an annual index and ranking created in 1995 by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' to measure the degree of [[economic freedom]] in the world's nations. The creators of the index took an approach similar to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', that "basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf |title = Executive Summary |publisher = Index of Economic Freedom |date = 15 January 2008 |accessdate = 4 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044144/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf |archivedate = 27 February 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite news |author = William Beach, Time Kane |url = http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf |title = Methodology; Measuring the 10 Economic Freedoms |publisher = Index of Economic Freedom |date = 15 January 2008 |accessdate = 4 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044142/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf |archivedate = 27 February 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The 2018 ranking scores aspects of economic freedom between 0 and 100, with 0 meaning "no economic freedom" and 100 meaning "total economic freedom". There are twelve aspects divided into four categories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.heritage.org/index/book/methodology Methodology | 2018 Index of Economic Freedom Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of law===
;Property rights
Degree of a country's legal protection of private property rights and degree of enforcement of those laws. It is divided into the following sub-factors:
# physical property rights
# [[intellectual property]] rights
# strength of investor protection
# risk of [[expropriation]]
# quality of land administration

;Judicial effectiveness
Degree of the [[judiciary]]'s efficiency and fairness, especially dealing with property laws. It is divided into the following sub-factors:
# judicial independence
# quality of the [[judicial process]]
# likelihood of obtaining favorable judicial decisions

;Government integrity
Analyzes how prevalent are forms of [[political corruption]] and practices such as [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], [[patronage]], [[embezzlement]], and [[graft (politics)|graft]]. It is divided into the following sub-factors: 
# [[public trust]] in politicians
# irregular payments and bribes
# [[Open government|transparency]] of government [[policymaking]]
# absence of corruption
# [[Corruption Perceptions Index|perceptions of corruption]]
# governmental and civil service transparency

===Government size===
;Tax burden
Analyzes [[marginal tax]] rates on personal and corporate income and the overall taxation level (including direct and indirect taxes imposed by all levels of government) as a percentage of the [[GDP]]. Its sub-factors are:
# top marginal tax rate on individual income
# top marginal tax rate on corporate income
# total tax burden as a percentage of GDP

;Government spending
Quantifies the burden of [[government expenditure]]s, including consumption by the state and all transfer payments related to various [[entitlement program]]s. The ideal level varies from country to country, but zero expenditure is used as a benchmark.

;Fiscal health
Analyzes how well a country manages its budget by quantifying the growing [[debt]] and [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]. It is divided into the following sub-factors: 
# average deficits as a percentage of GDP for the most recent three years (80 percent of score)
# debt as a percentage of GDP (20 percent of score)

===Regulatory efficiency===
;Business freedom
Analyses the cost, time and freedom to open, operate and close a business, taking into consideration factors like electricity. It is divided into thirteen sub-factors:
# starting a business—procedures (number);
# starting a business—time (days);
# starting a business—cost (% of income per capita);
# starting a business—minimum capital (% of income per capita);
# obtaining a license—procedures (number);
# obtaining a license—time (days);
# obtaining a license—cost (% of income per capita);
# closing a business—time (years);
# closing a business—cost (% of estate);
# closing a business—recovery rate (cents on the dollar);
# getting electricity—procedures (number);
# getting electricity—time (days); and
# getting electricity—cost (% of income per capita).

;Labor freedom
Quantifies the intrusivness of [[labor rights]] such as [[minimum wage]], laws inhibiting layoffs, severance requirements, and measurable regulatory restraints on hiring and hours worked, plus the labor force participation rate as an indicative measure of employment opportunities in the labor market. It is divided into the following sub-factors:
# ratio of minimum wage to the average value added per worker
# hindrance to hiring additional workers
# rigidity of hours
# difficulty of firing redundant employees
# legally mandated notice period
# mandatory severance pay
# labor force participation rate

;Monetary freedom
Analyses how stable are prices and how much [[microeconomy]] intervenes. It is divided into the following sub-factors:
# weighted average [[inflation rate]] for the most recent three years
# price controls

===Market openness===
;Trade freedom
Quantifies the extent to which [[tariff]] and [[nontariff barriers]] affect [[imports]] and [[exports]] of goods and services into and out of the country. Its sub-factors are:
# trade-weighted average tariff rate
# nontariff barriers (NTBs)

;Investment freedom
Analyses how free or constrained is the flow of [[investment capital]] of individuals and firms.

;Financial freedom
Indicates [[bank]]ing efficiency as well as how independent from the government is the financial sector. This aspect looks at five broad areas:
# extent of government regulation of financial services
# degree of state intervention in banks and other financial firms through direct and indirect ownership
# government influence on the allocation of credit
# extent of financial and capital market development
# openness to foreign competition

==Meaning==
The Heritage Foundation reports that the top 20% on the index have twice the per capita income of those in the second quintile, and five times that of the bottom 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Mary Anastasia O'Grady|author-link=Mary O'Grady |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120036519907490279?mod=Letters | title = The Real Key to Development| work = Wall Street Journal |date= 15 January 2008 | accessdate=4 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Schramm]], who wrote the first chapter of the 2008 Index, states that cities of Medieval Italy and mid-19th century Midwestern American cities all flourished to the degree they possessed economic fluidity and institutional adaptiveness created by economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Carl J.

According to [[Will Wilkinson]] of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] [[Cato Institute]], studies show that higher economic freedom correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa590.pdf "In Pursuit of Happiness Research: Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?"], Will Wilkinson,  The Cato institute, Policy Analysis No. 590, 11 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to economists Tomi Ovaska and Ryo Takashima, economic freedom research suggests "that people unmistakably care about the degree to which the society where they live provides them opportunities and the freedom to undertake new projects, strongly with and make choices based on one's personal preferences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535705001770 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.054 | volume=35 | title=Economic policy and the level of self-perceived well-being: An international comparison | year=2006 | journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics | pages=308–325 | author=Ovaska Tomi, Takashima Ryo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Cato Institute, higher economic freedom promotes participation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://164.77.202.58/LYD/Controls/Neochannels/Neo_CH3996/deploy/TP-750-More%20freedom%20More%20happiness-23-01-2006.pdf More Freedom = More Happiness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029220045/http://164.77.202.58/LYD/Controls/Neochannels/Neo_CH3996/deploy/TP-750-More%20freedom%20More%20happiness-23-01-2006.pdf |date=29 October 2008 }}, Public Issues, Libertad Desarrollo, No. 750, 23 January 2006, {{ISSN|0717-1528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also claimed is that higher economic freedom is extremely significant in preventing wars; according to their calculations, freedom is around 54 times more effective than democracy (as measured by ''Democracy Score'') in diminishing violent conﬂict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf "Chapter2: Economic Freedom and Peace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |date=16 October 2008 }}, Erik Gartzke, in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'', James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, Fraser Institute, 30 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==
Since the index was created in 1995, the score for world economic freedom has increased, rising 2.6 points up to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Barry Wood |url = http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/DC1147215012008-1.htm | title = Economic Freedom Holding Steady, 14th Index of Economic Freedom Shows |publisher = PR Newswire |date= 15 January 2008 | accessdate = 4 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118184739/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/DC1147215012008-1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the score had decreased from the 2008 score of 60.2 to 59.7, which represents an increase of 2.2 points since 1995. The Economic Freedom score improved for 117 countries, the majority of countries included in the index, which were mainly [[Developing country|developing]] and [[Emerging markets|emerging market]] economies. With the exception of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there were increased levels of freedom recorded in all regions, with the greatest improvement shown in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The top five "free" economies identified by the 2011 index were [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Switzerland]], each scoring over 80 on the economic freedom grading scale.&lt;ref name=Exec11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2011/Index2011_ExecutiveHighlights.pdf |title=Executive Highlights |authorlink= |year=2011 |work=The Heritage Foundation |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Index was created in 1995, Hong Kong has been the top performing economy.&lt;ref name=Exec11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ed Feulner |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080122/OPINION/801220318/-1/LOCAL17 |title=Football and economic freedom |work=IndyStar |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319203320/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080122%2FOPINION%2F801220318%2F-1%2FLOCAL17 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the United States dropped to 9th place behind such countries as Denmark, Canada, and first-place Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Exec11/&gt; The Heritage Foundation has pointed to increases in government spending as the reason for the United States' decline, and according to data from the 2011 index, the growth rates of countries with the highest levels of government spending were 4.5 points lower, on average, than countries where government spending was under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/pdf/2011/Index2011_Chapter1.pdf |title=The Limits of Government |first=Terry |last=Miller |year=2011 |work=Heritage.org |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |page=13 |format=PDF |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their "Executive Highlights" of index results, the Heritage Foundation stated that  "high levels of government spending in response to the global economic turmoil have not resulted in higher economic growth".&lt;ref name=Exec11/&gt;

The results from the 2012 index showed an overall decline in global economic freedom; according to The Heritage Foundation, the average score in its ranking was the second lowest of the last ten years.&lt;ref name=APJan12&gt;{{cite news |title=Global economic freedom dipped last year, annual survey says; Hong Kong remains world’s freest |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/global-economic-freedom-dipped-last-year-annual-survey-says-hong-kong-remains-worlds-freest/2012/01/12/gIQADkyisP_story.html |work=Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the U.S. dropped to 10th place in the ranking, and has now fallen three places since 2008, when it was 7th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Still in top 10, but falling fast |author=Edwin Feulner |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/17/still-in-top-10-but-falling-fast/?page=1 |work=The Washington Times |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report issued by the Foundation stated that government spending was the cause of the decline, and had "not only failed to arrest the economic crisis, but also—in many countries—seems to be prolonging it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Step Backward for Economic Freedom in 2012 |author=Edwin J.

Countries that shared the same rank received a tie score.

According to the [[Freedom House]], "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Karatnycky. ''Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties''. Transaction Publishers. 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0101-2}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Millennium Challenge Account]], a U.S. government foreign aid program, has used the Trade freedom indicator in determining which countries will receive their performance-based compacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mcc.gov/documents/mcc-report-fy08-criteria%20and%20methodology.pdf |title=Report on the Criteria and Methodology for Determining the Eligibility of Candidate Countries for Millennium Challenge Account Assistance during Fiscal Year 2008 |work=Millennium Challenge Corporation |date=1 September 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044142/http://www.mcc.gov/documents/mcc-report-fy08-criteria%20and%20methodology.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics such as [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have contested the Index's assumption that economic openness necessarily leads to better growth. In his book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Sachs graphed countries' ratings on the index against GDP per capita growth between 1995 and 2003, claiming to demonstrate no correlation between a country's rating and its rate of economic growth. Sachs pointed out, as examples, that countries with good ratings such as Switzerland and Uruguay had sluggish economic performances, others, like China, with poorer rating had very strong economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143036586,00.html?The_End_of_Poverty_Jeffrey_D._Sachs ''The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for our Time''], Jeffrey Sachs, Penguin Books, 2005, {{ISBN|1-59420-045-9}}, pp. 320–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UAE]] questioned the rating of their country's economic freedom in 2008, comparing its middling rating with the high rating they had received from other indicators such as [[Transparency International]] and [[Moody's]]. They also argued that the report is "unreliable", because its methodology had changed twice in the last two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?id=16985&amp;t=1&amp;c=33&amp;cg=4 | title = UAE challenges its economic freedom ranking in paper by Heritage Foundation| work = Business Intelligence Middle East|date= 31 January 2008 | accessdate =31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Karlsson of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], challenged the usefulness of the index due to the fuzziness of many of the categories used to determine freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mises.org/library/failings-economic-freedom-index |title=The Failings of the Economic Freedom Index |author=Stefan Karlsson |work=Mises Daily |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=18 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WKdqPiFe?url=http://mises.org/library/failings-economic-freedom-index |archivedate=14 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller roundly criticizes the "Index", writing in ''[[Dollars &amp; Sense]]'', "In the hands of the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation, Washington's foremost right-wing think tank, however, an economic freedom index merely measures corporate and entrepreneurial freedom from accountability. Upon examination, the index turns out to be a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2005/0305miller.html "Free, Free at Last"], John Miller, ''Dollars and Sense'', No. 258, March/April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to Left Business Observer, growth in Index accounts for 10% of the variation in the growth of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/FreedomIndex.html "Laissez-faire Olympics, an LBO special report"], Left Business Observer, 26 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method (old)===
The Index's 2008 definition of economic freedom is "the highest form of economic freedom provides an absolute right of property ownership, fully realized freedoms of movement for labor, capital, and goods, and an absolute absence of coercion or constraint of economic liberty beyond the extent necessary for citizens to protect and maintain liberty itself."&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/faq.cfm |title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Index of Economic Freedom |date = 15 January 2008 |accessdate = 4 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123195720/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/faq.cfm |archivedate = 23 January 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index scores nations on ten factors of economic freedom, separated into four categories, using statistics from organizations like the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and [[Transparency International]]. In each factor, countries are scored 0 to 100, with 0 being the least free and 100 the most free. A score of 100 signifies an economic environment or set of policies that is most conducive to economic freedom.&lt;ref name="index"/&gt; The methodology has shifted and changed as new data and measurements have become available, especially in the area of Labor Freedom, which was given its own indicator spot in 2007.&lt;ref name="freedom"/&gt; The following list explains what each factor currently assesses and groups them according to their respective category:

;Rule of Law
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/property-rights Property Rights]''': Degree of a country's legal protection of private property rights, degree of enforcement of those laws, independence of and corruption within the [[judiciary]], and likelihood of [[expropriation]].
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/freedom-from-corruption Freedom from Corruption]''': The non-prevalence of [[political corruption]] within a country, according to the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].

;Limited Government
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/fiscal-freedom Fiscal Freedom]''': How free is a country from tax burden. It comprises three quantitative measures: top marginal tax rate of both individual (1) and corporate (2) income, and total tax burden as a percentage of GDP (3).
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/government-spending Government Size/Spending]''': Governments' expenditures as a percentage of GDP, including consumption and transfers. The higher the percentual spending, the lower the score.

;Regulatory Efficiency
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/business-freedom Business Freedom]''': A country's freedom from the burden of regulations on starting, operating, and closing business, given factors such as time, cost and number of procedures, as well as the efficiency of government in the regulatory process.
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/labor-freedom Labor Freedom]''': How free is a country from legal regulation on the labor market, including those relating to minimum wages, hiring and firing, hours of work and severance requirements.
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/monetary-freedom Monetary Freedom]''': How free from microeconomic intervention and price instability is a country, basing on an equation considering the weighted average inflation rate in the last three years and price controls.

;Open Markets
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/trade-freedom Trade Freedom]''': Freedom from sizeable numbers and burdens of [[tariff]]s and [[non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]] to imports and exports of a country.
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/investment-freedom Investment Freedom]''': Freedom from restrictions on the movement and use of investment capital, regardless of activity, within and across the country's borders.  
*'''[http://www.heritage.org/index/financial-freedom Financial Freedom]''':  A country's independence from government control and interference in the financial sector, including banks. It considers government ownership of financial firms, extent of financial and capital market development, government influence on the allocation of credit and openness to foreign competition.

Bill Dalton's '''''Indonesia Handbook''''', published by [[Moon Publications]] in [[California]], was the main English language tourist [[guide book]] for the whole of [[Indonesia]] between the 1970s and the 1990s.  
== History ==
The book originated in 1973 as a typewritten publication, ''A Traveler's Notes: Indonesia'', printed by Dalton when he was travelling in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Dalton, Bill | title=Indonesia a traveller's notes | publication-date=1973 | publisher=Moon Publications | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9425158 | accessdate=23 December 2014 }} and 1974 reprint {{Citation | author1=Dalton, Bill | title=Indonesia : a traveller's notes | publication-date=1974 | publisher=[Moon Publications] | isbn=978-0-9598052-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led Dalton to form his company, Moon Publications, when he returned to California, and expand and publish his Travel Notes as a full book, the Indonesia Handbook.

The earlier editions in the late 1970s were much smaller than the later editions.  During the [[Suharto]] era the guide book was at times banned. By the time of the last edition, published in 1995, the book was 1,380 pages long.

Moon expanded its range to publish a large number of travel handbooks, following the successful format of the Indonesia Handbook, to cover other areas, for example the ''South Pacific Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;''Moon Handbooks South Pacific'' (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-56691-411-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by David Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moon.com/author-q-a/green-travel-talk-david-stanley Moon Travel Guides website: ''Green Travel Talk with David Stanley'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalton sold his interest in Moon Publications in 1999, and the new owners dropped the title.

==Other publications==
The Department of Information of the [[Government of Indonesia]] published a volume with the same title between 1970 and 1977 - and it had been compiled and produced by Japenpa Foreign Languages Publishing Institute.

In 1996 the title ''Indonesia Handbook'' was used for a new guide book by [[Footprint Books]], publisher of the ''[[South American Handbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Eliot (1996) ''Indonesia Handbook'' {{ISBN|978-0-900751-78-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Jean-Gilles Malliarakis''' (born 22 June 1944 in [[Paris]]) is a [[France|French]] [[far-right]] politician and writer.
==Biography==
Jean-Gilles Malliarakis is the son of [[Greece|Greek]] painter 'Mayo' (Antoine Malliarakis) and of a French mother. He grew up in an intellectual, artistic background , as his father was a friend of [[Jacques Prévert]] and [[Albert Camus]]. He says that he became strongly [[anti-communist]] at the age of 15 after seeing a play written by Camus and based on [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|Demons]]''. While still a teenager, he began frequenting far-right groups. First a member of [[Action française]]'s youth branch, he later joined the student movement [[Occident (movement)|Occident]], alongside other notable French political figures such as future government members [[Alain Madelin]], [[Gérard Longuet]], [[Patrick Devedjian]] and future [[National Front (France)|National Front]] executive [[François Duprat]] &lt;ref&gt;Charpier, pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually stopped frequenting Occident in 1966&lt;ref&gt;Charpier, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; and was formally expelled from the group the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Charpier, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst a student at the [[Sciences Po|Paris Institute of Political Studies]], he created his own movement, ''Action nationaliste''&lt;ref&gt;Chebel d'Apollonia, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;, which was classified as [[neofascism|neofascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Milza, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he notoriously organized at the Institute of Political Studies a meeting the celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]'s founding by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;Milza, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year, he was arrested after a left-wing student was grievously wounded during a fight between student activist groups. Malliarakis, who had been knocked out during the fight, was found unconscious by police forces and put in detention. He was eventually freed three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Charpier, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he took part to the founding meeting of the neo-fascist groupe [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|Ordre Nouveau]].&lt;ref&gt;Charpier, p. 221-222&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he left frontline politics for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; He resurfaced in the mid-1970s when he bought the bookstore owned by [[Henry Coston]] and his wife. His shop, the "Librairie française", became a notorious venue for the far right in Paris. At the same time, he joined the ''Groupe action jeunesse'' (GAJ), a movement which advocated [[solidarism|solidarist]] and [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]] positions and a "[[third Position|third way]]" between communism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Chebel d'Apollonia, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he renamed the GAJ ''Mouvement nationaliste révolutionnaire'' (MNR). He advocated at that time "national revolutionary" positions.&lt;ref name="camus90"&gt;Camus, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Pierre Milza]] described Malliarakis' positions as somewhat similar to Mussolini's early left-wing [[fascism]] and [[Georges Valois]]'s interwar [[Faisceau]].&lt;ref&gt;Milza, p. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Malliarakis attempted to create a coalition with other far right groups such as [[Pierre Sidos]]' L'Œuvre française, but the alliance was short-lived. As the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] became dominant in the French far right, he tried to create an alliance with the [[Party of New Forces]] and, in 1984, renamed his own movement [[Third Way (France)|Third Way]]. He also tried to form an alliance with the [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne|GRECE]] but this attempt was fruitless. An alliance with the [[Groupe Union Défense|GUD]] was equally short-lived.&lt;ref name="camus90"/&gt; Also during the 1980s, he started working for the neo-[[Poujadist]] syndicate ''Confédération de défense des commerçants et artisans''&lt;ref name="camus90"/&gt; and became a speaker at the right-wing station [[Radio Courtoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-courtoisie.over-blog.com/article-573308.html Jean-Gilles Malliarakis], radio-courtoisie.over-blog.com, 26 juin 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1991, the Third Way movement split after a conflict with [[Christian Bouchet]]'s tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Malliarakis later dissolved what was left of the movement and retired from frontline politics to concentrate on his work at Radio Courtoisie and to his activity as a book publisher under the imprint ''Éditions du Trident''. He eventually adopted [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] positions and joined [[Alain Madelin]]'s ''Idées action'' mouvement.&lt;ref&gt;Charpier, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, after the death of station founder [[Jean Ferré]], he left Radio Courtoisie as he disagreed with the policies of the radio's new director [[Henry de Lesquen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-courtoisie.over-blog.com/tag/%28lj%20jean-gilles%20malliarakis%29/ LJ Jean-Gilles Malliarakis 23/2], radio-courtoisie.over-blog.com, 23 février 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has since then continued his activity as book publisher and as an online politics commentator. He also works for the anticommunist think tank ''Institut d'histoire sociale''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://droites-extremes.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/10/19/la-mairie-de-paris-exfiltre-un-colloque-sur-lislamisme-organise-avec-jean-gilles-malliarakis/ La mairie de Paris exfiltre un colloque sur l’islamisme organisé avec Jean-Gilles Malliarakis], ''Droites extrêmes'', on ''[[Le Monde]]'', 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Le Statut des Moines''' is a short French translation of [[Muslim]] [[jurist]] [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]'s [[Ibn Taymiyyah#Mardin fatwa and the Mardin Conference|Mardin fatwa]] by [[Nasreddin Lebatelier|Yahyah Michot]], published in 1997, under the pseudonym of Nasreddin Lebatelier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Ibn Taymiyya’s "New Mardin Fatwa". Is genetically modified Islam (GMI) carcinogenic?|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/michot/ITA-Mardin-Conference.pdf|journal=Hartford Seminary- The Muslim World|issue=1|last1=Michot|first1=Yahyah|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation is considered a misprint and a gross misinterpretation of the original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1996, the Algerian ''Groupe Islamique Armé'' ([[Armed Islamic Group]] or GIA) published an announcement that it considered lawful to murder [[Martyrs of Atlas|seven Trappist monks in Tibhirine]], under the fatwa.

==History==
In the misprint of a short fatwa on monks, Ibn Taymiyya is said to have argued that those in the [[religious order]]s who were found outside their [[monastery|monasteries]] might in certain circumstances be killed; they might also be killed if they had dealings with people outside their monastic community. However, in 2010, investigation proved that this fatwa was attributed to a misprint in 1909 edition of the fatwa which originally read "dealt with" instead of "killed."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hassan|first1=Hassan|title=A religious basis for violence misreads original principles|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/a-religious-basis-for-violence-misreads-original-principles|accessdate=6 August 2016|agency=The National|publisher=The National|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly seven hundred years after it was written by Ibn Taymiyya, this tract was reprinted in 1997 in Beirut by Nasreddin Lebatelier (a pen name of Yahya Michot) under the title ''Le Statut des Moines'', with an introduction which discussed the Groupe Islamique Armé’s Communiqué no 43. To the justifications given by the killers, Michot opposed the consenus (ijmâ‘) of the Muslim community which clearly condemned them and he endorsed this consensus.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was nevertheless accused by Catholic authorities and media to have condoned the killing of the seven Trappists. Michot negotiated his departure from the University of Louvain, which paid him a financial indemnity, including 50% of his lawyer's fees. Once appointed as the first Muslim lecturer of Islamic theology in Oxford, Michot faced renewed Catholic hostility, notably in various articles by Margaret Hebblethwaite in The Tablet (22 and 29 August 1998; 12 September 1998) and in an interview of the same activist on BBC 4, Sunday program (27 September 1998).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Oxford nevertheless confirmed his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Gazette, 23 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, when new evidence emerged that the killings of the fatwa of Mardin were based on a 1909 misprint, that resulted him writing the erroneous translation ''Le Statut des Moines'', he distanced himself from condoning any killings by [[jihadist]] groups and denied ever having condoned the actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9887">The '''Library of Congress Subject Headings''' ('''LCSH''') comprise a [[thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]] (in the [[information science]] sense, a [[controlled vocabulary]]) of [[subject heading]]s, maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]], for use in bibliographic records. LC Subject Headings are an integral part of [[bibliographic control]], which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents. It first appeared in year 1898, a year later to the publication of Library of Congress Classification(1897). The latest 38th edition was published in year 2016. LOC has ceased the print publication and a weekly updated list, supplement to the 38th edition is published.  LCSHs are applied to every item within a library's collection, and facilitate a user's access to items in the catalogue that pertain to similar subject matter. If users could only locate items by 'title' or other descriptive fields, such as 'author' or 'publisher', they would have to expend an enormous amount of time searching for items of related subject matter, and undoubtedly miss locating many items because of the ineffective and inefficient search capability.

== An art and a science ==
Subject heading classification is a human and intellectual endeavor, where trained professionals apply topic descriptions to items in their collections. Naturally, every library may choose to categorize the subject matter of their items differently, without a uniform consentaneous standard. The widespread use and acceptance of the ''Library of Congress Subject Headings'' facilitates the uniform access and retrieval of items in any library in the world using the same search strategy and LCSH [[thesaurus]], if the correct headings have been applied to the item by the library. Thus, LCSH decisions involve a great amount of debate and even controversy in the library community.

Despite LCSH's wide-ranging and comprehensive scope, there are libraries where the use of LCSH is not ideal or effective. To deal with these types of collections and user communities, other subject headings may be required. The United States [[National Library of Medicine]] developed [[Medical Subject Headings]] ([[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]]) to use on its many health science databases and collection. Many university libraries may not apply both LCSH and MeSH headings to items. In Canada, the [[National Library of Canada]] worked with LCSH representatives to create a complementary set of [[Canadian Subject Headings]] (CSH) to access and express the topic content of documents on [[Canada]] and Canadian topics.

== LCSH policy issues ==
Historically, issues have revolved around the terms employed to describe [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnic]] groups. Notable has been the terms used to describe [[African-Americans]]. Until the 1990s, the LCSH administrators had a strict policy of not changing terms for a subject category. This was enforced to tighten and eliminate the duplication or confusion that might arise if subject headings were changed. Therefore, one term to describe African-American topics in LCSH was 'Afro-American' long after that term lost currency and acceptance in the population. LCSH decided to allow some alteration of terms in 1996 to better reflect the needs and access of library users. Nevertheless, many common terms, or 'natural language' terms are not used in LCSH, and may in effect limit the ability for users to locate items. There is a growing tradition of research in [[Library and Information Science]] faculties about the cultural and gender biases that affect the terms used in LCSH, which in turn may limit or deprive library users access to information stored and disseminated in collections. A notable American Library Science scholar on this subject is [[Sanford Berman]].

Berman has also pointed out the difficulty in finding material on certain topics, such as various [[Denialism|denialisms]], because the natural language terms for them, [[Climate change denial|climate change denialism]], for example, have not been incorporated into LCSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berman |first1=Sanford |authorlink1=Sanford Berman |title=Library Catalogs Deny Science Denial |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also arisen regarding the biased organization and description of materials on sexuality. Works about heterosexuality are scarcely labeled as such in LCSH, giving users the impression that only queer sexuality deserves examination because heterosexuality is normative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 10.1086/669547|title = Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction|last = Drabinski|first = Emily|date = April 2013|journal = The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy|doi = 10.1086/669547|pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 83|page = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data access ===
The Subject Headings are published in large red volumes (currently ten), which are typically displayed in the reference sections of research libraries. They may also be searched online in the [http://classificationweb.net/ Library of Congress Classification Web], a subscription service, or free of charge (as individual records) at [http://authorities.loc.gov/ Library of Congress Authorities]. The Library of Congress issues weekly updates. The data is published for a fee by the Cataloging Distribution Service.

A web service, [http://lcsh.info/ lcsh.info], was set up by Ed Summers, a Library of Congress employee, circa April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dynamicorange.com/2008/04/02/skos-linked-data-and-lcsh/ |title=SKOS, Linked Data and LCSH! |author=Rob Styles |work=I Really Don't Know |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314132812/http://dynamicorange.com/2008/04/02/skos-linked-data-and-lcsh/ |archivedate=2010-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[SKOS]] to allow for simple browsing of the subject headings. lcsh.info was shut down by the Library of Congress's order on December 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcsh.info/comments1.html |title=lcsh.info " Blog Archive " uncool uris |author=Ed Summers |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226071945/http://lcsh.info/comments1.html |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement was met with great dismay from the library science and semantic web communities, e.g. [[Tim Berners-Lee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcsh.info/comments1.html#comment-3 |title=Tim Berners-Lee's comment on Uncool URIs |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226071945/http://lcsh.info/comments1.html#comment-3 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}{{failed verification|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tim Spalding]] of [[LibraryThing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2008/12/lcsh-info-rip.php |title=LCSH.info, RIP |author=[[Tim Spalding]] |work=Thingology |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some delay, the Library did set up its own web service for LCSH browsing at [[id.loc.gov]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/ala/an-2009-update.html |title=Library of Congress Update for 2009 ALA Annual Conference, January-May, 2009 (The Library of Congress at ALA Annual Conference 2009) |quote=In April, 2009 the Beta version of ID.LOC.GOV with the ''LCSH'' vocabulary went live. |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using LCSH ==
Timothy Binga, Director of Libraries at the [[Center for Inquiry]], notes issues that make it more difficult to use the standardized language of LCSH to find material. These include systems that allow patrons to informally tag materials in the catalog, book creators and publishers who do their own cataloging, and the incorrect application of LCSH to controversial material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Binga |first1=Timothy |title=Information Bias in Library Catalogs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, the use of [[hyperlink]]ed, web-based Online Public Access Catalogues, or [[OPAC]]s, allow users to hyperlink to a list of similar items displayed by LCSH once one item of interest is located. However, because LCSH are not necessarily expressed in natural language, many users may choose to search OPACs by keywords. Moreover, users unfamiliar with OPAC searching and LCSH, may incorrectly assume their library has no items on their desired topic, if they chose to search by 'subject' field, and the terms they entered do not strictly conform to a LCSH. For example, 'body temperature regulation' is used in place of 'thermoregulation'. Thus the easiest way to find and use LCSH is to start with a 'keyword' search and then look at the Subject Headings of a relevant item to locate other related material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10811">The '''Official National Front''' ('''ONF''') was one of two [[far-right]] groups to emerge in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1986 following a split within the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]. Following ideological paths that were mostly new to the [[Far right in the United Kingdom]], the ONF stood opposed to the more traditionalist [[Flag Group]].

==Development==
The ONF emerged in the early 1980s when young radicals such as [[Nick Griffin]], [[Derek Holland (activist)|Derek Holland]], [[Patrick Harrington]] and [[David Kerr (Northern Irish politician)|David Kerr]] became attracted to [[Third Position]] ideas and, eschewing the route of electoral politics favoured by the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] up to that point, hoped to develop a cadre of devoted nationalist revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity]]'', New York University Press, 2003, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasising a strong [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] as well as [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] line, the ONF began to emerge as the most powerful group within the NF after the series of splits in late 1979 and early 1980 though they did not come to prominence within the NF until 1984 when Martin Webster was expelled from the Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Gable]], 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, and M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', London: Longman, 1992, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

The Political Soldier faction began with the support of chairman [[Andrew Brons]] but before long differences between the two factions began to show. This came to a head in 1986 when the party split in two, with around 2,000 of the NF's 5,000 membership following Griffin into the ONF and the rest departing for the Flag Group.&lt;ref&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The ONF maintained the monthly newspaper the ''National Front News'' and took control also of ''Nationalism Today'' during this period. 

With control assured the ONF took on responsibility for instructing its members ideologically and gained the backing of [[Rosine de Bounevialle]], a veteran of the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] and the publisher of the [[anti-Semitic]] journal ''[[Candour (magazine)|Candour]]'', who allowed these training seminars to be held on her [[Hampshire]] estate.&lt;ref name="Clarke689"/&gt; Subsequently these were moved to specially prepared buildings on land owned by Nick Griffin's father [[Edgar Griffin|Edgar]].&lt;ref&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Aided by [[Roberto Fiore]], whose ''[[Terza Posizione]]'' held similar views, the ONF developed an ideology that stressed the need for a "New Man" with the cadre structure influenced by the "nest" system of the pre-[[Second World War]] [[Romania]]n [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name="Clarke689"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun'', pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; The two main sources of ideology for the ONF were the journal ''Rising'' published from 1983 to 1986 and ''The Political Soldier'', a 1984 book by Derek Holland. Within the pages of these works the ONF committed itself to a revolt against modernity, echoing many of the words of the likes of [[Corneliu Codreanu]] and [[Julius Evola]].&lt;ref name="Clarke69"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The party put emphasis on the values of ruralism with Nick Griffin, who lived on a farm in Wales, running a "Smash the Cities" campaign for the ONF that has been compared by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] to [[Pol Pot]]ism.&lt;ref name="Clarke43"/&gt;

Unlike the earlier NF, that had emphasised British identity, the ONF showed sympathy towards indigenous [[nationalism]]s within the [[United Kingdom]]. The ONF adopted a policy of support for [[Ulster nationalism]], a fringe idea within [[Northern Ireland]], and through this shift forged links with the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and in particular [[John McMichael]] who was advocating such an idea at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', pp. 260-261&lt;/ref&gt; Separate links were also maintained with sometime [[Democratic Unionist Party]] activist [[George Seawright]] who, although not avowedly an Ulster nationalist, was the brother of ONF activist David Seawright.&lt;ref name="Gable260"/&gt; Although there was no evidence of a direct connection between the two groups the ONF broke from the exclusively British nationalist vision of its predecessors to praise the activities of the [[Welsh nationalist]] [[Meibion Glyndŵr]].&lt;ref name="Clarke43"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; 

The desire for the development of a fanatical Political Soldier also led the ONF to follow their [[Italy|Italian]] counterparts in expressing some admiration for a similar fanaticism that they saw in [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Clarke69"/&gt; This idea led to the publication of the most notorious issue of ''NF News'' which featured a cover extolling the 'new alliance' of the party with the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Louis Farrakhan]], a previously unthinkable stance in the NF.&lt;ref&gt;''National Front News'', No. 108, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; During a march for [[Quds Day]] in 1988 Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson took their place alongside a group of [[Islamic fundamentalists]].&lt;ref name="Gable260"&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

The '[[scientific racism]]' that had been the cornerstone of NF ideas up to that point was abandoned by the ONF in favour of an emphasis on [[ethnopluralism]] and expressions of admiration for [[Black separatist]] leaders such as Farrakhan and [[Marcus Garvey]], a new departure illustrated by the August 1987 edition of ''National Front News'' in which the slogan '[[Black is beautiful]]' appeared.&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the [[Nation of Islam]]-linked newspaper ''[[The Final Call]]'' could also be purchased from the ONF.&lt;ref name="Noise10"&gt;N, Lowles &amp; S. Silver, ''White Noise'', London: Searchlight, 1998, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The desire to build a Political Soldier leadership meant that the ONF was by its nature exclusive and limited. Membership in its strictest sense was effectively closed off with outsiders only allowed to become "Friends of the Movement" and full membership being only open to those chosen by the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas held less appeal for the [[Nazi-Skinheads|racist skinhead]]s that the ONF still had links with.&lt;ref name="Noise10"/&gt; The ONF saw the skinheads as a source of eager foot-soldiers for their revolutionary struggles, a factor that led the ONF to host [[Rock Against Communism]] concerts in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun'', pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt; However, disillusionment set in with the ONF's esoteric ideas and in 1987 sometime NF member and [[Skrewdriver]] singer [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] joined with [[British Movement]] organiser [[Nicky Crane]] to set up [[Blood and Honour]], initially as a magazine before developing it into a movement for [[White nationalism#White power|White power]] bands independent of the parties. The departure of these groups also meant a loss of one of the ONF's main sources of revenue and the split proved fairly divisive with B&amp;H supporters dubbing the ONF the "Nutty Fairy Party" due to their unusual ideas and rumours of [[homosexuality]] within the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Lowles &amp; Silver, ''White Noise'', pp. 9–14&lt;/ref&gt; The split came at a bad time as membership had already been curtailed by the decision in 1986 to double the price of membership fees and to restrict membership to those considered worthy of Political Soldier status by the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The group's devotion to the likes of Evola and Codreanu also damaged its chances as these thinkers were virtually unknown in Britain and as such the ONF's ideas were considered too foreign to be relevant to a British context.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Thurlow, ''Fascism in Britain: From Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts to the National Front'', I.B.Tauris, 1998, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to gain much needed funds, Griffin and Holland travelled to [[Libya]] in 1988 in the hope of persuading [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to provide money to bankroll the ONF. However, the pair were able to secure only a consignment of copies of the colonel's political testament ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'', meaning that the group's financial woes were not alleviated.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Searchlight]]'', October 1999, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking from its own ban on electoral activity, Harrington ran as a candidate in the [[Vauxhall by-election, 1989]], during which his rival candidates included the Flag Group's [[Ted Budden]], who confusingly was standing as a "National Front" candidate. Both men received derisory vote shares.&lt;ref&gt;David Boothroyd, ''[[Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties]]'', 2001, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Harrington, who was by then effective leader of the group, approached ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' with a view to opening dialogue with the [[Jew]]ish community. The move proved unpopular with Griffin and Holland who broke off in 1989 to form the [[International Third Position]] (ITP), which advocated [[anti-capitalist]] [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] views, as well as continuing anti-Zionism.&lt;ref name="Copsey456"&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; With the ONF in disarray, Harrington (by then effective leader, although the ONF had eschewed an individual leader at their peak) wound up the group in January 1990 and reconstituted it, along with about fifty NF members, as the [[Third Way (UK organisation)|Third Way]], which continued to offer a programme akin to that of the Political Soldier movement.&lt;ref name="Copsey456"/&gt; The [[Flag Group]], led by [[Martin Wingfield]] and [[Ian Anderson (British politician)|Ian Anderson]], reclaimed the NF name and identity and sought to reposition the NF once again by following the example of the base itself on the ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]'', which was experiencing growth in [[France]] through [[right-wing populism]].&lt;ref&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia Holmgren (née Kern)''' is an [[United States|American]] botanist. Holmgren's main botanical interests are the flora of the U.S. [[Intermountain West|intermountain west]] and the genera ''[[Tiarella]]'' and ''[[Thlaspi]]''. Holmgren was the director of the herbarium at the New York Botanical Garden from 1981-2000, and editor of ''[[Index Herbariorum]]'' from 1974-2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:William Buck, Patricia Holmgren - New York Botanical Garden Herbarium Group Photo.jpg|alt=A group photo of 5 herbarium employees, standing in front of a large pile of specimens in boxes|thumb|Patricia Holmgren (front) with fellow New York Botanical Garden herbarium staff (behind, L to R): Lois Brako, Barbara Thiers, Bill Buck, &amp; Jim Grimes.]]
After completing her Ph.D. at the [[University of Washington]], Holmgren accepted a job as herbarium specialist at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG) in 1968. Holmgren spent her entire working career at NYBG, eventually becoming the Director of the Herbarium in 1981, a position she held until her retirement in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As director of The William and Lynda Steere Herbarium, Holmgren insisted on the highest possible standards for specimen management and for keeping the herbarium in the forefront on new innovations (such as the creation of an online ''[[Index Herbariorum]]'' and development of the C.V. Starr Virtual Herbarium).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864358652|title="Digitizing The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium" in Harmony and grit : papers celebrating the Holmgrens' completion of intermountain flora|last=Thiers|first=Barbara M., et al.|publisher=|others=Buck, William R., Naczi, Robert F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9238">The '''Pueblo linguistic area''' (or '''Pueblo Sprachbund''', '''Pueblo convergence area''') is a [[Sprachbund]] (group of languages with similarities due to [[language contact]]) consisting of the language spoken in and near North American [[Pueblo]] locations. There are also many [[Puebloan peoples|shared cultural practices]] in this area. For example, these cultures share many ceremonial vocabulary terms meant for prayer or song.{{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=318}}

==Language membership==

The languages of the linguistic area are the following:

* [[Zuni language]]
* [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan family]]
* [[Keresan language]]
* [[Hopi language]]
* [[Navajo language]]

The languages belong to five different families: Zuni, Tanoan, Keresan, [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] (Hopi), and
[[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] (Navajo, from the [[Apachean languages|Apachean subfamily]]). Zuni is a [[language isolate]].
Navajo is only a marginal member of the Sprachbund and does not share all its linguistic features, as the ancestors of the Navajo originated from Canada and Alaska and were relatively recent newcomers to the Southwest. Languages in the Tanoan and Apachean families, and additionally Hopi, can be compared to relatives not affected by this particular region's [[Areal feature|areal features]] as a reference for changes due to contact.{{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=318}}

Tanoan consists of [[Taos language|Taos]], [[Picurís language|Picurís]], [[Tewa language|Tewa]], and [[Towa language|Jemez]]. Keresan consists of Eastern Keres and Western Keres.&lt;ref&gt;Keresan (or Keres) has variously been considered as a small family of two languages or a single language of [[Dialect continuum|dialect chaining]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shared linguistic traits and aereal features==

The following are the [[Areal feature|shared linguistic traits]] of the Pueblo Sprachbund:

* [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], absent only in Zuni{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}
* SOV word order (though inherited from proto-languages in the case of Navajo [[Proto-Athabaskan]] and Hopi (Proto(-Northern)-Uto-Aztecan){{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}
* [[ejective]] [[consonant]]s {{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}
* [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants {{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}
* {{IPA|/i, e, a, o, u/}} [[vowel]] systems {{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Sherzer|1976|p=133}}
* final [[Voicelessness#Voiceless vowels and other sonorants|devoicing]] of vowels &amp; [[sonorant]]s{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}
* [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]]
* ceremonial vocabulary {{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=318}}
* [[labialized]] [[velar]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/kʷ, kʷʼ/}} {{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}

Most languages have ejectives. Zuni may have developed ejectives due to contact with Tanoan and Keresan which both have complete series of ejectives: Zuni has {{IPA|/tsʼ, tʃʼ, kʼ, kʷʼ/}} but lacks the ejectives {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ/}} found in the other languages. Taos and Picurís (both Tanoan) have {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ, tʃʼ, kʼ, kʷʼ/}}; Tewa (Tanoan) has {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ, tsʼ, kʼ, kʷʼ/}}; Jemez (Tanoan) has {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ, kʼ/}};&lt;ref&gt;In Jemez, Proto-Tanoan 
*c’ has merged with 
*t’ and 
*kʷ’ has merged with 
*kʷ explaining the lack of {{IPA|/tsʼ, kʷʼ/}} in Jemez that are found in other Tanoan languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Keresan has {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ, tsʼ, tʂʼ, tʃʼ, kʼ, sʼ, ʂʼ, ʃʼ/}} (as well as [[Glottalic consonant|glottalized]] [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/mʼ, nʼ, rʼ, wʼ, jʼ/}}). Hopi lacks ejectives completely. Navajo has {{IPA|/tʼ, tsʼ, tɬʼ, tʃʼ, kʼ, kʷʼ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;The lack of {{IPA|/pʼ/}} in Navajo is an inheritance from [[Athabascan#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabascan]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Navajo may have acquired the stop /kʷ/ &lt;!-- Isn't this just a regular stop, not an ejective? --&gt; from Puebloan contact.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Sherzer|1976|p=151-152}}
Sherzer suggests that contact led to Acoma Keres sharing glottalized sonorants and glides with Navajo.{{sfn|Sherzer|1976|p=137}}

Zuni may have obtained its partial glottalized set and aspirants via contact with Tanoan and Keresan, which both have fully integrated series of glottals.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}

Other shared traits include Santa Clara acquiring retroflex sounds from Keresan and the Navajo acquiring /hʷ/ from Tanoan contact.{{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=318}} Keresan may be the common source of glottalized nasals and semivowels in Navajo, and the development of /r/ in dialects of Tewa and Tiwa and possibly Hopi.{{sfn|Mithun|1999|p=318}}

Linguist [[Paul V. Kroskrity|Paul Kroskrity]] argues for diffused Apachean traits in Tewa, such as the [[Passive voice|passive]] marked by [[Prefix|prefixes]] that are structured differently from those of other Tanoan languages.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}} In these languages the verb is made [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] by allowing an [[Agent (linguistics)|agent]] argument in the verb structure.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}} This also includes [[Patient (grammar)|patient subjects]] and cases where the subject must be [[Animacy|animate]], including raising animate objects to the place of inanimate subjects.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}} Further, Navajo and Tewa are the only languages in this group to have a "recognizable [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphor]] as a [[relativizer]]" when forming relative clauses.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|p=65}} Kroskrity also finds similarity in the Tewa [[Possessive affix|possessive suffix]] -bí, which parallels the third person possessive prefix bi- found in Apachean languages.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339-340}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|p=66}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}} This can be seen in the following example provided by Kroskrity:{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=340}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|p=66}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}}

|}

This paralleling morpheme is also used in these languages' postpositional constructions.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=340}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1982|p=66}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1985|}}{{sfn|Kroskrity|1993|p=60-66}} The reason for this diffusion&lt;!-- All the diffusion or just this morpheme? --&gt; has been attributed to trade networks and Apachean settlements near Pueblos in winter months.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=340}}

==Vowels==
Sherzer suggests that the 2-2-1 vowel system found in Tanoan languages (i, e, a, o, u) may be a result of contact with Zuni and Keresan language families.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=339}} Sherzer states, "A 2-2-1 vowel system is a Pueblo-cintered regional areal trait. Its development in some Tanoan languages may be due to contact with Zuni and Keresan."{{sfn|Sherzer|1976|p=133}}

'''Sam Muchnick''' (August 22, 1905 – December 30, 1998&lt;ref name="PS55"&gt;{{cite news|title=Power Slam|work=What's going down...|publisher = SW Publishing|id=55|page=7|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling]] promoter from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He is often regarded as wrestling's equivalent of [[Pete Rozelle]] (the forward-thinking commissioner who revolutionized the [[NFL]]), and he was instrumental in establishing the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], which became the industry's top governing body, in 1948.&lt;ref name="PS55"/&gt;  Muchnick served as the NWA's president from 1950 to 1960 and again from 1963 to 1975. He operated the [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]], one of the primary members of the NWA based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="PS55"/&gt;

==Early life==
Muchnick was born in [[Ukraine]] to a [[Jew]]ish family on August 22, 1905, but moved to the [[United States]] in 1911. He grew up in [[St. Louis]], and his name was changed to ''Samuel'' when his father decided that ''Jeshua'' ([[Jesus]] or [[Joshua]]) was an inappropriate name for a Jewish child. While attending school, he worked various jobs to help out his family before earning his high school degree (though he ditched his graduation to attend a live wrestling event at the Odeon Theatre, where he watched the great [[Wladek Zbyszko]] in action).  In 1924, he took a job with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]; and in 1926, he joined the sports staff at the ''St. Louis Times'' newspaper, where he covered the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] team while developing many influential acquaintances (including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Al Capone]], and others). Muchnick also covered [[professional wrestling]], where he formed a friendship with [[Tom Packs]], who was the Midwest's top sports promoter. In 1932, the Times merged with the rival ''St. Louis Star'', and Muchnick left the paper for a position as Packs' publicist, where he handled [[public relations]], finances, and even booking duties.

==St. Louis promoter==
For nine years, Muchnick served as Tom Packs' right-hand man while learning the ropes under one of the nation's most powerful promoters.  However, Muchnick was insulted when Packs awarded him a paltry $200 bonus following the duo's successful promotion of the [[Joe Louis]] vs. Tony Musto heavyweight title bout in April 1941 (a fight that drew profits of $14,000). Muchick then decided to leave his mentor when longtime wrestling champion [[Jim Londos]] (who was also on the outs with Packs) convinced him to start his own organization. Despite facing heavy resistance from Packs (who possessed much political clout with the State Athletic Commission), Muchnick promoted his first shows in May 1942 before enlisting in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] during [[World War II]]. Upon returning, Muchnick continued to face competitive pressures from Packs; though he filed several court injunctions to promote his first show at St. Louis' renowned [[Kiel Auditorium]] on December 5, 1945. With the help of maverick Ohio promoter [[Jack Pfefer]] (who sent Sam several wrestlers to help him get started), Muchnick drew 3,771 fans to the arena while featuring such veteran wrestling stars as [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]], Roy Dunn, and others.

==National Wrestling Alliance==
Over the next few years, Muchnick was often forced to use old-timers past their primes as Packs employed most of the top talent (including reigning World Champion [[Lou Thesz]]). Then in mid-1948, Muchnick was approached by Iowa's Pinky George and Minnesota's Tony Stecher about forming a new wrestling union.  Up until this time, all pro wrestling regulations had come from the [[National Wrestling Association]], which was made up of various athletic commissions. Their idea was to form a coalition of promoters, which would then share the bookings of the World Champion and top wrestlers, while also splitting the gate draws. As a result, on July 19, 1948, Muchnick met with fellow promoters Pinky George, [[Wally Karbo]] (representing Tony Stecher), [[Orville Brown]], Max Clayton, and Al Haft at the President Hotel in [[Waterloo, Iowa]] to form what was named the National Wrestling Alliance.  Pinky George was named the organization's first President while Orville Brown was subsequently recognized as the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Shortly thereafter, Muchnick became the beneficiary of talent exchanges with various territories that joined the NWA. As a result, he was then able to secure the services of an innovative young heel named [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]], who had previously been wrestling in [[Jack Pfefer]]'s [[Toledo, Ohio]] territory. Rogers' outspoken persona and charismatic personality allowed him to outdraw even the great Lou Thesz (who by now had taken over much of [[Tom Packs]]' operation) while adding legitimacy to Muchnick's company.  Eventually, the two St. Louis groups would merge while starting a promotional war angle; and Muchnick kept a controlling interest in the territory by holding two percentage points more than Thesz. Then on November 27, 1949, Thesz unified the National Wrestling Association and National Wrestling Alliance World Titles after Brown was injured in an auto accident prior to their scheduled match.

==NWA President==
In 1950, Sam Muchnick was named the new President of the NWA, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected for the next nine years due to the immense trust that he inspired among the various members of the organization. With Muchnick at the helm, the NWA became the dominant governing body in pro wrestling, as nearly every major wrestling territory across the country joined the Alliance in order to gain access to the treasure chest that was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who was universally recognized as the industry's premier star. Under Muchnick's leadership, the NWA would also donate thousands of dollars to help fund the [[Olympic Games|U.S. Olympic Wrestling Team]]. Then in the late 1950s, Sam Muchnick formed the St. Louis Wrestling Club while producing a new [[television]] program titled ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'' on [[KPLR-TV]], which ran from May 23, 1959 to September 10, 1983. There were approximately 1,100 episodes made during that time span. The show would become one of the most popular local productions in St. Louis television history as it turned pro wrestling into a nationally popular entertainment while bringing the many stars of the NWA into the homes of its fans.

By 1960, Sam Muchnick stepped aside as NWA President so that the organization could benefit from new ideas. He served as executive secretary under [[Frank Tunney]], [[Fred Kohler]], and Karl "Doc" Sarpolis. Consequently, Muchnick was unanimously re-installed as NWA President in 1963 and held the office until 1975, thus contributing a total of 25 years as the industry's most influential promoter.  During his second reign, Muchnick maintained the NWA’s position as wrestling's top power while he also displayed an uncanny eye for scouting future talent, as his St. Louis territory groomed such eventual champions as [[Johnny Valentine]], [[Gene Kiniski]], [[Harley Race]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]], [[Ric Flair]], and many others.  Moreover, he expanded the NWA globally by inking agreements with territories in [[Mexico]], the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], and the [[Caribbean]].

==Retirement and death==
Muchnick promoted his last card on January 1, 1982, which was subsequently named "Sam Muchnick Day" in St. Louis by Mayor [[Vincent Schoemehl]]. Shortly afterward, the St. Louis Wrestling Club was purchased by Bob Geigel, Pat O'Connor and Harley Race. Muchnick's former announcer and general manager [[Larry Matysik]] formed his own completing promotion in St. Louis around the same time. A year later, the WWF made a deal with Matysik which brought them into St. Louis and gave them the former TV timeslot of "Wrestling At The Chase". In 1985, the St. Louis Wrestling Club was sold to [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] and absorbed into what eventually became World Championship Wrestling. At WWF [[In Your House]] [[Badd Blood]] 1997, he was honored as a St. Louis legend.

Muchnick died on December 30, 1998, in St. Louis. He was 93.&lt;ref name="PS55"/&gt;

The '''Skirball Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] that burned in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California, United States, and one of [[December 2017 Southern California wildfires|multiple wildfires]] that broke out across Southern California in December 2017.&lt;ref name = "Etehad1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-brentwood-fire-20171206-story.html|title=Homes burning in Bel-Air as 150-acre fire closes the 405 Freeway and forces evacuations|date=2017-12-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-06|last=Etehad|first=Melissa|last2=Nelson|first2=Laura J.|last3=Kohli|first3=Sonali|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire burned 422 acres (171 ha)&lt;ref name="Skirball Fire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafd.org/news/skirball-fire-update|title=Skirball Fire Update|author=Margaret Stewart|publisher=Los Angeles Fire Department|date=December 15, 2017|access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of land on the slopes of the [[Sepulveda Pass]] on its east or Bel Air side, causing the closure of [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]] (as well as the parallel [[Sepulveda Boulevard]]), a major traffic artery in the city.

A '''supermajority''' or '''supra-majority''' or a '''qualified majority''', is a requirement for a proposal to gain a specified level of support which is greater than the threshold of more than one-half used for [[majority]].

Related concepts regarding alternatives to the majority vote requirement include a '''majority of the entire membership''' and a '''majority of the fixed membership'''.

A supermajority can also be specified based on the entire membership or fixed membership rather than on those present and voting.

[[Parliamentary procedure]] requires that any action of a [[deliberative assembly]] that may alter the rights of a minority has a supermajority requirement, such as a two-thirds vote.

Changes to [[constitution]]s, especially those with [[entrenched clause]]s, commonly require supermajority support in a [[legislature]].

==History==
The first known use of a supermajority rule was in the 100s BCE in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name="schwartzberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartzberg |first1=Melissa |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=we80AgAAQBAJ |title=Counting the Many: The Origins and Limits of Supermajority Rule |chapter=Prelude: Acclamation and Aggregation in the Ancient World - The Origin of Supermajority Rules |chapter-url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=we80AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |page=44 |isbn=978-0-521-19823-3 |accessdate=2016-12-05 |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{how|date=October 2018}}

[[Pope Alexander III]] introduced the use of supermajority rule for [[papal election]]s at the [[Third Lateran Council]] in 1179.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schwartzberg|2013|pp= 51, 58–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of the United States, the determination of a [[presidential nominee]] once required the votes of two-thirds of delegates to the [[Democratic National Convention]]. This rule was adopted in the party's first [[presidential nominating convention]]—the [[1832 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Richard Franklin |last = Bensel |title = Passion and Preferences: William Jennings Bryan and the 1896 Democratic Convention |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 2008 |page = 131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-thirds rule gave [[southern Democrats]] an effective veto over any presidential nominee for many years, until the rule's abolition at the [[1936 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Bruce J. |last = Schulman |title = From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt: Federal Policy, Economic Development, and the Transformation of the South, 1938–1980 |publisher = Duke University Press |year = 1994 |page = 45 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common supermajorities==
{{Wiktionary|supermajority|qualified majority}}A [[Majority#Majority vote|majority vote]], or more than half the votes cast, is a common [[voting basis]]. Instead of the basis of a majority, a supermajority can be specified using any fraction or percentage which is greater than one-half (i.e., 50%).&lt;ref&gt;See dictionary definition of "supermajority" at [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/supermajority thefreedictionary.com]. "[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Qualified+majority Qualified majority]" redirects to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called a '''''qualified majority'''''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Common supermajorities include three fifths (60%), two thirds (67%), and three quarters (75%).

==={{anchor|Two-thirds}}Two-thirds vote===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Grand jury]] --&gt;
A two-thirds vote, when unqualified, means two-thirds or more of the votes cast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{harvp|Robert|2011|p = 402}}.p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#5 |title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 5) |date =  |accessdate = December 30, 2015 |website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher = The Robert's Rules Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; This voting basis is equivalent to the number of votes in favor being at least twice the number of votes against.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robert|2011|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abstention]]s and absences are excluded in calculating a two-thirds vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book |title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised |last = Robert |first = Henry M. |publisher = Da Capo Press |year = 2011 |isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5 |location = Philadelphia |edition = 11th |ref = harv |display-authors = etal |page = 401 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-thirds requirement can be qualified to include the entire membership of a body instead of only those present and voting, but such a requirement must be explicitly stated (such as "two-thirds of those members duly elected and sworn").&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, abstentions and absences count as votes against the proposal.

Alternatively, the voting requirement could be specified as "two-thirds of those present", which has the effect of counting abstentions but not absences as votes against the proposal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For example, say an organization has 150 members and at a meeting, 30 members are present with 25 votes cast. In this case, a "two-thirds vote" would be 17. If the requirement was "two-thirds of those present", that number would be 20. "Two-thirds of the entire membership" would be 100.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Three-fifths, or 60 percent===
Another type of supermajority is three-fifths (60 percent). This requirement could also be qualified to include the entire membership or to include those present.

In 2006, the [[Constitution of Florida]] was amended to require a 60% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Florida_Amendment_3,_Supermajority_Vote_Required_to_Approve_a_Constitutional_Amendment_(2006)&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop|title=Florida Amendment 3, Supermajority Vote Required to Approve a Constitutional Amendment (2006) - Ballotpedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===55 percent===
For the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum held in 2006]] the European Union [[Diplomacy|envoy]] [[Miroslav Lajčák]] proposed independence if a 55% supermajority of votes are cast in favor with a minimum turnout of 50%. Such procedure, ultimately accepted by the [[government of Montenegro]], was somewhat criticized as overriding the traditional practice of requiring a two-third supermajority, as practiced in all ex Yugoslav countries before (including the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|previous referendum in Montenegro]]).

In 2016, the [[Constitution of Colorado]] was amended to require a 55% majority to pass new constitutional amendments by popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Imposition of Distribution and Supermajority Requirements for Citizen-Initiated Constitutional Amendments, Amendment 71 (2016)|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Imposition_of_Distribution_and_Supermajority_Requirements_for_Citizen-Initiated_Constitutional_Amendments,_Amendment_71_(2016)|website=Ballotpedia|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
Related concepts regarding alternatives to the majority vote requirement include a "majority of the entire membership" and a "majority of the fixed membership".

===Majority of the entire membership===
A '''majority of the entire membership''' is a [[voting basis]] that requires that more than half of all the members of a body (including those absent and those present but not voting) vote in favor of a proposition in order for it to be passed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvp|Robert|2011|p = 403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms, it means an absence or an abstention from voting is equivalent to a "no" vote.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#6 |title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 6) |date =  |accessdate = December 30, 2015 |website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher = The Robert's Rules Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be contrasted with a majority vote which only requires more than half of those actually voting to approve a proposition for it to be enacted. An '''absolute majority''' may also be the same as a majority of the entire membership, although this usage is not consistent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title = International Institutional Law: Unity Within Diversity |last = Schermers |first = Henry G. |publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year = 2011 |isbn = 978-90-04-18798-6 |location = Leiden, The Netherlands |pages = 561–563 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OMXToQLp21UC&amp;pg=PA562 |edition = Fifth Revised |last2 = Blokker |first2 = Niels M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Absolute majority of members (European Parliament) |publisher = EUAbc.com |url = http://en.euabc.com/word/6 |accessdate = June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a supermajority could be specified in this voting basis, such as a vote of "two-thirds of the entire membership".

By way of illustration, in February 2007 the Italian Government fell after it won a vote in the [[Italian Senate]] by 158 votes to 136 (with 24 abstentions). The government needed an absolute majority in the 318 member house but fell two votes short of the required 160 when two of its own supporters abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Prodi stands down after surprise defeat in senate over US alliance |newspaper = The Guardian |first = John |last = Hooper |date = February 22, 2007 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/22/italy.topstories3 |accessdate = June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority of the fixed membership===

A '''majority of the fixed membership''' is based on the total number of the established fixed membership of the deliberative assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used only when a specific number of seats or memberships is established in the rules governing the organization.

A majority of the fixed membership would be different from a majority of the entire membership if there are vacancies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, say a [[Board of directors|board]] has 12 seats. If the board has the maximum number of members, or 12 members, a majority of the entire membership and a majority of the fixed membership would be 7 members. However, if there are two vacancies (so that there are only 10 members on the board), then a majority of the entire membership would be 6 members (more than half of 10), but a majority of the fixed membership would still be 7 members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible for organizations that use a majority of the fixed membership to be caught in a [[gridlock (politics)|stalemate]] if at least half the membership consists of vacancies, making it impossible to perform any actions until those vacancies are filled.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The requirement for a minimum number of members to be present in order to conduct business, called a [[quorum]], may be used to avoid such a possibility.

Similar to the voting basis for the entire membership, a supermajority could be specified for this basis, such as a vote of "two-thirds of the fixed membership".

==Use in parliamentary procedure==
[[Parliamentary procedure]] requires that any action that may alter the rights of a minority has a supermajority requirement. ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' states:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Quote|text = As a compromise between the rights of the individual and the rights of the assembly, the principle has been established that a two-thirds vote is required to adopt any motion that: (a) suspends or modifies a rule of order previously adopted; (b) prevents the introduction of a question for consideration; (c) closes, limits, or extends the limits of debate; (d) closes nominations or the polls, or otherwise limits the freedom of nominating or voting; or (e) takes away membership.|sign = |source = }}This book also states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robert|2011|p = 404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text = The vote of a majority of the entire membership is frequently an alternative to a requirement of previous notice, and is required in order to rescind and expunge from the minutes (see p. 310). Otherwise, prescribing such a requirement is generally unsatisfactory in an assembly of an ordinary society, since it is likely to be impossible to get a majority of the entire membership even to attend a given meeting, although in certain instances it may be appropriate in conventions or in permanent boards where the members are obligated to attend the meetings.|sign = |source = }}

==Use in governments around the world==

===Canada===
In Canada, most constitutional amendments can be passed only if identical resolutions are adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and two thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population.

=== Denmark ===
Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Denmark]] states that if the government or parliament wants to cede parts of national sovereignty to an international body such as the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]], it has to get a five sixths majority in the [[Folketing]] (150 out of 179 seats).&lt;ref name="Min Grundlov p. 27"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pedersen |first1=Susannah |last2=Christensen |first2=Jens Peter |authorlink2=Jens Peter Christensen |url=http://www.ft.dk/Dokumenter/Publikationer/Grundloven/~/media/PDF/publikationer/Grundloven/Min_Grundlov.ashx |format=PDF |title=Min grundlov - Grundloven med forklaringer |chapter=03 - Regeringen |edition=13 |publisher=Folketingets Kommunikationsenhed |date=November 2015 |pages=27–28 |isbn=87-7982-172-3 |quote=Til vedtagelse af lovforslag herom kræves et flertal på fem sjettedele af Folketingets medlemmer.

===European Union===
====Council====
{{Main|Voting in the Council of the European Union}}
The [[Council of the European Union]] uses [[Voting in the Council of the European Union#Qualified majority voting|'Qualified majority voting']] for the majority of issues brought before the institution. However, for matters of extreme importance for individual member states, unanimous voting is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.4.2.html|title=Intergovernmental decision-making procedures - EU fact sheets - European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the accession of Croatia, on 1 July 2013, at least 260 votes out of a total of 352 by at least 15 member states were required for legislation to be adopted by qualified majority.

From 1 July 2013, the pass condition translated into:
# At least 15 (or 18, if proposal was not made by the Commission) countries,
# At least 260 of the total 352 voting weights,
# At least 313.6 million people represented by the states that vote in favour.

====Parliament====
Requirements to reach an absolute majority is a common feature of voting in the [[European Parliament]] (EP) where under the [[Ordinary legislative procedure#Ordinary legislative procedure|ordinary legislative procedure]] the EP is required to act by an absolute majority if it is to either amend or reject proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 294(7) of the [[Treaty on the functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[Amendment of the Constitution of India|Article 368]] of the [[Indian Constitution]] requires a supermajority of two-thirds of members present and voting in each house of [[Indian Parliament]], subject to at least by a majority of the total membership of each House of Parliament, to amend the constitution. In addition, in matters affecting the states and judiciary, at least two thirds of all the states need to ratify the amendment.

===International agreements===
The [[Rome Statute]] may only be amended by a seven-eighths majority of participating states.

===Japan===
Amendments to the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Diet]] and a simple majority in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |title = The Constitution of Japan |date =  |accessdate = December 30, 2015 |website = japan.kantei.go.jp |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Under the 1999 constitution, election of principal officers of the [[National Assembly (Nigeria)|National Assembly]], or a state House of Assembly requires a two-thirds majority of members present during the session. Voting on legislation also requires a two-thirds majority. An exception exists for laws on the exclusive schedule of the federal constitution such as state and local government creation/addition. Changes require the approval of at least two-thirds of the state Houses of Assembly and both houses of the National Assembly with a two-thirds majority in each house. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria |url = http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm |website = Nigeria law |accessdate = November 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative veto of the executive at either state or federal government level requires a two-thirds majority of the corresponding legislative assembly. The same requirements are needed to impeach a sitting president or state governor. 

=== Philippines ===
Under the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]], a two-thirds majority of both houses of the [[Congress of the Philippines]] (the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House]] and the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]]) meeting in [[joint session]] is required to [[Declaration of war|declare war]].&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;[http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ 1987 Constitution of the Philippines], ''Official Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; A two-thirds majority of both Houses is required to override a presidential [[veto]].&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Bulmer, [https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/presidential-veto-powers-primer.pdf International IDEA Constitution-Building Primer 14: Presidential Veto Powers Primer], [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance]], 2d ed. 2017, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; A two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress voting separately is required to designate the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] as [[acting president]] in the event that a majority of the Cabinet certifies that the president is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office" but the president declares that no such inability exists.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A two-thirds vote of either chamber is required to suspend or expel a member from that chamber.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt;

Under the 1987 Constitution, "The Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of all its Members, call a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|constitutional convention]], or by a majority vote of all its Members, submit to the electorate the question of calling such a convention."&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A three-fourths vote of all the members of the Congress is required to propose an amendment to the Constitution; the proposed amendment is submitted to the people for ratification (by a majority of the votes cast) in a [[plebiscite]].&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt;

A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to ratify treaties, and to remove an [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached]] official from office.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; Impeachment by the House, which is the required first step in the removal process, only requires one-third of Representatives to sign a petition (specifically a verified complaint or resolution of impeachment).&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/asia/2000/11/09/impeachment-in-the-philippines Impeachment in the Philippines: Joseph Estrada faces a tough fight to hold on to his presidency], ''The Economist'' (November 9, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seth Mydans, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/14/world/philippine-congress-impeaches-president-on-graft-charges.html Philippine Congress Impeaches President on Graft Charges], ''New York Times'' (November 14, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
The approval of three-fifths of legislators is required before a bill can be put to a vote in the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]], in order to prevent the ruling party pass laws without the support of opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = The Tyranny of the Minority in South Korea |url = http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-tyranny-of-the-minority-in-south-korea/ |website = The Diplomat |accessdate = December 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
====Constitutional Reform====
The 1978 Constitution states that a three-fifths majority in both [[Congress of Deputies]] and [[Senate of Spain]] is needed to pass a constitutional reform, but if a two-thirds majority is reached in the Congress of Deputies, an [[absolute majority]] of senators is enough to pass the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Title X of the Constitution: Constitutional Reform (in Spanish) |url = http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=166&amp;fin=169&amp;tipo=2 |website = Constitución.es |accessdate = June 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, when a new Constitution is proposed, or when the proposal's goal is to reform the Preliminary Title, the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms or the Title on the Crown, the supermajority becomes significantly harder:
* A supermajority of two-thids must be reached in both Congress of Deputies and Senate.
* Both chambers must be dissolved.
* The new elected chambers must approve the proposal by a new two-thirds supermajority.
* Finally, the proposal is passed by [[majority]] in [[referendum]].

The first way has been used twice (1992 and 2011), but the second has been never used.

====Other legal procedures====
Spanish Constitution states other supermajorities:
* Members of the [[General Council of the Judiciary]] are appointed by the Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain, and each appointment needs a three-fifths majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Title VI of the Constitution: The Judiciary (in Spanish) |url = http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=117&amp;fin=127&amp;tipo=2 |website = Constitución.es |accessdate = June 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] are also appointed by both Congress of Deputies and Senate of Spain, and each appointment needs a three-fifths majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Title IX of the Constitution: The Constitutional Court (in Spanish) |url =https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Congreso-inmediatamente-presidente-RTVE-exigencia_0_657234417.html |website = Constitución.es |accessdate = June 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The president of the [[RTVE]], the public radio and television broadcaster, must be elected by two-thirds majority of the Congress of Deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = The Congress passes that the president RTVE will be appointed by consensus again (in Spanish) |url =https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Congreso-inmediatamente-presidente-RTVE-exigencia_0_657234417.html |website = eldiario.es |accessdate = June 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other legal procedures====
Each Spanish [[Autonomous Community]] has her own [[Statute of Autonomy]], that works as a kind of Constitution subject to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 Constitution]] and national powers.

=====Canary Islands=====
The Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands states that its Economic and Fiscal Regime and the Electoral Law need a two-thirds majority of the Parliament to be modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands (in Spanish) |url =http://www.parcan.es/pub/estatuto.pdf | accessdate = June 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its behalf, the [[Ombudsman]] needs a three-fifth majority to be appointed.

Also, if two-thirds of the MPs from a circumpscription votes for a veto against a law project, it must be posposed to the following session.

===Taiwan===
Before the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 2005, the constitution amendments need to be passed by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]]. Since the Additional Articles ratified on June 7, 2005, the National Assembly is replaced by the Legislative Yuan. Amendments of the constitution need to be passed by three quarters of the members of Legislative Yuan, with more than half (50%) of voters hold [[referendums]] to approve the amendments.

===United Kingdom===
The [[House of Commons (UK)]] can be dissolved and an election held before the expiry of its 5-year term by a vote of two-thirds of the membership of the House of Commons since 2011 under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].

This is the only supermajority required in the [[British Constitution]].

However, Parliament can also be dissolved if the House of Commons passes a motion of no-confidence in the government and no new government wins a motion of confidence within two weeks of the original vote of no-confidence.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations Security Council]] requires a supermajority of the fixed membership on substantive matters (procedural matters require a simple majority of those present and voting). According to Article 27 of the [[United Nations Charter]], at least nine of the Security Council's 15 members (i.e., a three-fifths supermajority) must vote in favor of a draft [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolution]] in order to achieve passage. Specifying the fixed membership has the effect of making abstentions count as votes against—absences are not normal but would be treated the same way.

This is useful for the five permanent members of the Council (the [[United States]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]]) because a vote against from any one of them constitutes a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]], which cannot be overridden. Permanent members who do not support a measure, but are unwilling to be seen to block it against the wishes of the majority of the Council, tend to abstain; abstentions by veto powers are generally seen by close observers of the UN{{according to whom|date=September 2016}} as the equivalent of not vetoing votes against and have the same impact on the decision of the Security Council.

===United States===

====Federal government====
The [[Constitution of the United States]] requires supermajorities in order for certain significant actions to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hudiburg |first1=Jane A. |title=Supermajority Votes in the House |date=July 24, 2018 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, DC |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-778.pdf |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed in one of two ways: a two-thirds supermajority votes of each house of [[United States Congress]] or a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|convention]] called by Congress on application of two thirds (currently 34) of the states. Once proposed, the amendment must be ratified by three quarters (currently 38) of the states (either through the State legislatures, or ratification conventions, whichever "mode of ratification" Congress selects).

Congress may pass bills by simple majority votes. If the [[President of the United States|president]] [[Veto#United States|vetoes]] a bill, Congress may [[veto override|override]] the veto by a two-thirds supermajority of both houses.

A treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate to [[Entry into force|enter into force and effect]].

Section 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] gives Congress a role to play in the event of a presidential disability. If the vice president and a majority of the president's cabinet declares that the president is unable to serve in that role, the vice president becomes acting president. Within 21 days of such a declaration (or, if Congress is in recess when a president is disabled, 21 days after Congress reconvenes), Congress must vote by two-thirds supermajorities to continue the disability declaration; otherwise, such declaration expires after the 21 days and the president would at that time "resume" discharging all of the powers and duties of the office. While Section 3 of this amendment (in which the president declares that they are unable to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency) has been invoked three times, Section 4 has yet to be invoked.

The House may, by a simple majority vote, [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] a federal official (such as, but not limited to, the president, vice president, or a federal judge). Removal from office (and optional disqualification from any Federal, State or local office) requires a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate. In 1842, the House failed to impeach president [[John Tyler]]. In 1868, the Senate fell one vote short of removing president [[Andrew Johnson]] following his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment]]. In 1999, efforts to remove [[Bill Clinton]] following [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|his impeachment in 1998]] fell just short of a simple majority, and 17 votes short of the two-thirds supermajority. The impeachment procedure was last used in 2010, when Judge [[Thomas Porteous]] was removed from office. Each chamber may expel one of its own members by a two-thirds supermajority vote; this last happened when the House expelled [[James Traficant]] in 2002.

A two-thirds supermajority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is 67 out of 100 senators, while a two-thirds supermajority in the House is 290 out of 435 representatives. However, since many votes take place without every seat in the House filled and representative participating, it does not often require 67 senators or 290 representatives to achieve this supermajority.

Apart from these constitutional requirements, [[Cloture#United States|a Senate rule]] (except in cases covered by the [[nuclear option]], or of a rule change) requires an absolute supermajority of three fifths to move to a vote through a [[cloture]] motion, which closes debate on a bill or nomination, thus ending a [[filibuster]] by a minority of members. In current practice, the mere threat of a filibuster prevents passing almost any measure that has less than three-fifths agreement in the Senate, 60 of the 100 senators if every seat is filled.

====State government====
For [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures in the United States]], ''[[Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure|Mason's Manual]]'' says, "A deliberative body cannot by its own act or rule require a two-thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote. To require a two-thirds vote, for example, to take any action would be to give to any number more than one-third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title=MAS |pages=353 |edition=2000 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states require a supermajority for passage of a constitutional amendment or statutory initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/supermajority-vote-requirements.aspx |title=Supermajority Vote Requirements |date=  |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |website=www.ncsl.org |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many state constitutions allow or require amendments to their own constitutions to be proposed by supermajorities of the state legislature; these amendments must usually be approved by the voters at one or more subsequent elections. Michigan, for instance, allows the Legislature to propose an amendment to the Michigan Constitution; it must then be ratified by the voters at the next general election (unless a special election is called).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Michigan Legislature |title=Article XII § 1 |url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(p22jjt45odksm455blth42nj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-Article-XII-1 |work=[[Constitution of Michigan]] of 1963 |accessdate=December 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, the state legislature may override a [[Governor (United States)|governor]]'s veto of legislation. In most states, a two-thirds supermajority of both chambers is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Karen |last= Shanton |url=http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2013/10/28/wrapup-of-veto-overrides-in-states-with-veto-proof-legislatures-and-divided-government.aspx |title=Wrapup of Veto Overrides in States with Veto-Proof Legislatures and Divided Government |work=NCSL Blog |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures |date = October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some states (e.g., [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]] and [[North Carolina]]), only a three-fifths supermajority is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dan |last=Friedman |title=The Maryland State Constitution: A Reference Guide |series=Reference Guides to the State Constitutions of the United States, No. 41 |publisher=Praeger |year=2006 |page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ann M. |last=Lousin |title=The Illinois State Constitution |series=Oxford Commentaries on the State Constitutions of the United States |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |pages=119–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/legislation/constitution/ncconstitution.html |title=North Carolina State Constitution |access-date = May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in West Virginia only a normal majority is needed.

One common provision of so-called "[[taxpayer bill of rights]]" laws (either in state statutes or [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]]) is a requirement of a supermajority vote in the state legislature to increases taxes. The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in 2010 that fifteen states required a supermajority vote (either a three-fifths, two-thirds or three-fourths majority vote in both chambers) to pass some or all tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Bert |last = Waisanen |url = http://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/state-tax-and-expenditure-limits-2010.aspx |title = State Tax and Expenditure Limits—2010 |publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] |year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supermajority requirements for tax increases have been criticized as "deeply flawed" by a report by the [[progressivism|progressive]] [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]], since such requirements make it difficult to close tax loopholes, empower a minority of legislators, make it difficult to fund transportation [[infrastructure]], and may encourage [[pork barrel|pork-barrel]] spending as a trade-off to ensure passage of a tax increase (see [[logrolling]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Nicholas |last = Johnson |url = http://www.cbpp.org/research/a-super-bad-idea-requiring-a-two-thirds-legislative-supermajority-to-raise-taxes-protects |title = A Super Bad Idea: Requiring a Two-thirds Legislative Supermajority to Raise Taxes Protects Special Interest Tax Breaks and Gives Budget Veto Power to a Small Minority of Legislators |publisher = [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] |date = April 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Babism}}
'''Talismans''' are referred to in several of the writings of the [[Báb]], founder of the [[Bábism|Bábí Faith]], and to a lesser extent in the writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= talismans |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 333–334 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Bábism==
A ''Da'ira'' ({{lang|ar|دائرة}} ''circle'') is a symbolic circular [[talisman]] for women described by the Báb. For men he instructed the use of a ''[[Bahá%27í_symbols#Five-pointed_star|Haykal]]'' (''temple''), a five-pointed star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Denis MacEoin |authorlink = Denis MacEoin |year = 1994 |title = Rituals in Babism and Baha'ism |publisher = British Academic Press and Centre of Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge |location = UK |isbn = 1-85043-654-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Bpd0xhUKewC |pages = 14–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader Saiedi explains that these terms should not be interpreted too literally, and that one should focus on their spiritual meaning. The Haykal is a symbol for the [[Manifestation of God]], while the circle refers to the "Sun of Truth," another term for the Manifestation of God. Their purpose is constant awareness of the symbolic meanings, and to help the Bábís to recognize ''"[[He whom God shall make manifest]]"'' when he would appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON | pages = 330–331 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XTfoaK15t64C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
Bahá'u'lláh, who claimed to be the one promised by the Báb, de-emphasized this type of esoteric elements of Bábism (including [[alchemy]] &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keven (2002/2012). ''[http://bahai-library.com/brown_reflection_theory_alchemy A Reflection on the Theory of Alchemy as Explained in the Bahá'í Writings].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keven (1997). ''[http://bahai-library.com/brown_hermes_apollonius Hermes Trismegistus and Apollonius of Tyana in the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh]'' in Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a Bahá'í Theology, Studies in the Babi and Bahá'í Religions, vol. 8, pp. 153-187. Kalimat Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;) and stressed rationality. He states for example ''"Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess."''&lt;ref name ="schaefer-2007"&gt;{{cite book |last = Schaefer |first = Udo |authorlink = Udo Schaefer |year = 2007  |title = Bahá'í Ethics in Light of Scripture, Volume 1 - Doctrinal Fundamentals |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn =  0-85398-505-7 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3SvpjZAIBSwC |pages = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shahvar | first = Soli | authorlink = | title =The Forgotten Schools: The Bahá'ís and Modern Education in Iran 1899-1934| publisher =I.

They have the capacity to do good deeds and attract blessings, and are able to ward off evil from themselves or others.&lt;ref name ="schaefer-2007" /&gt;

There are some [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í prayers]] that offer talismanic protection, for example, the ''[[Long Healing Prayer]]''. [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] stated that the [[Greatest Name]] offers protection.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

'''''Tao of Jeet Kune Do''''' is a book expressing [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[martial arts]] [[philosophy]] and viewpoints, published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] (after Bruce Lee's death in 1973). The project for this book began in 1970 when Bruce Lee suffered a [[human back|back]] injury during one of his practice sessions. During this time he could not train in [[martial arts]]. He was ordered by his doctors to wear a back brace for 6 months in order to recover from his injury. This was a very tiring and dispiriting time for Lee who was always very physically active.

It was during his [[convalescence]] that he decided to compile a [[treatise]] on the system or approach to martial arts that he was developing; he called it [[Jeet Kune Do]].  The bulk of these writings would become the "core set of writings". Many of these writings were done during a single session which provided natural continuity. Lee had also kept various notes throughout the development of his [[combat]] philosophy and these would become the disparate notes used in the book. Many of these notes were "sudden inspirations" which were incomplete and lacked any kind of a construct. The combination of the "core set of writings" and the "disparate notes" would be known as the text ''Tao of Jeet Kune Do''.
[[File:TAO OF JEET KUNE DO 2.jpg|thumb|[[File:TAO OF JEET KUNE DO 3.jpg|thumb]]]]
In [[1971]], it was Lee's intent to finish the treatise that he started during his convalescence. However, his film career and work prevented him from doing so. He also vacillated about publishing his book as he felt that this work might be used for the wrong purposes. Lee's intent in writing the book was to record one man's way of thinking about the martial arts. It was to be a guidebook not a set of instructions or "How to" manual to learn martial arts.

In 1975, after Bruce Lee's death, his widow [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] decided to make available the information her husband had collected.  Lee's untimely death changed the perspective of releasing the information that Bruce Lee had vacillated about. The "core writings" and various notes were put together in a logical fashion by various editors. The main editor was Gilbert L. Johnson. Johnson along with Linda Lee, [[Dan Inosanto]] and other students of Bruce Lee helped him understand Jeet Kune Do well enough to editorialize and organize Lee's material into text.

The book is dedicated to: ''The Free, Creative Martial Artist''. Lee's wife, Linda Lee Cadwell holds the [[copyright]] to the book. The book is attributed to Bruce Lee as his notes and work were used to compile the book. It is important to understand that although Lee's material was utilized it was not organized by him; therefore Bruce Lee was not strictly its author.&lt;!--THERE IS A DISCUSSION SECTION ON THIS PARAGRAPH ENTITLE "AUTHORSHIP".  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS SECTION WITHOUT DISCUSSION.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lee| first = Linda| authorlink = Linda Lee Cadwell| title = Tao of Jeet Kune Do|publisher = Ohara Publications, Inc| year = 1975| pages = | isbn = 0-89750-048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bruce Lee's autobiography==
''Tao of Jeet Kune Do'' was compiled posthumously from Bruce Lee's personal notes, some of which were in turn copied from Bruce Lee's personal library of martial arts and philosophical books. Ohara Publications has acknowledged Edwin Haislet, Hugo and James Castello, Roger Crosnier and Julio Castello as original sources.  After the book's initial publication, additional passages were discovered to have been sourced from the works of [[D.T. Suzuki]], Eric Hoffer, and other authors. 
Many of Bruce Lee's statements are derived from his own studies of various schools of philosophy and the martial arts, and are sometimes paraphrases of previous expressions by others which he wrote down for his own instruction into his own words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.martialdevelopment.com/blog/the-annotated-tao-of-jeet-kune-do/ |title=The Annotated Tao of Jeet Kune Do |accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1975 1st edition==
[[File:TOJKDLE.jpg|230px|thumb|Cover of the 2006 Limited Edition Collector's Edition book with certificate of authenticity.]]
In 1975 the Tao of Jeet Kune Do was first made available only in paperback. The book was initially NOT available in [[Hardback]]; A Hardback edition was first made available in 1976. The forgoing statement is attributed to Black Belt Magazine and the source data is at http://blackbeltmag.com/daily/traditional-martial-arts-training/jeet-kune-do/the-saga-of-bruce-lee-tao-of-jeet-kune-do/[4] Subsequent editions have been available in [[paperback]] form only except for the following;  In 2006, [[Black Belt Magazine]] offered this book in hardback form, on a 500-copy [[Limited edition|Limited Collector's Edition]]; the book is personally signed by Bruce Lee's widow Linda Lee Cadwell and his daughter [[Shannon Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shopblackbelt.com/taoofjekudol.html&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the hardback edition from such sources as [[eBay]] typically fetch high prices and usually do not include the much sought after [[dust jacket]].

'''Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums''' (TWAM) is a regional group of [[United Kingdom]] [[National Museums of the United Kingdom|national museums]] and the county archives service located across the [[Tyne and Wear]] area of north-east [[England]]. They have been administered by a joint board of local authorities since the abolition of the [[Tyne and Wear]] [[Metropolitan County Council]] in 1986.   

They receive financial support from the five local authorities they operate within and since 2012, [[Arts Council England]]. The service is one of those specified in the [[Designation Scheme]] administered by [[Arts Council England]]. In the past, the service received additional financial support from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. 

== Museums ==
Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums are responsible for managing the 10 museums and galleries below and the county archives. They also share use of the Regional Museums Store at [[Beamish Museum]].

==Cross Service Collaborative Ventures==
Partnership between the museums and galleries both inside and outside of TWAM has been a significant matter. One example is [[The Late Shows]] which has run every May since 2007. Another large-scale project has been "A History of the North East in 100 Objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100objectsne.co.uk |title=A History of the North East in 100 Objects |publisher=100objectsne.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that launched in June 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4049">A '''uniform title''' in [[library catalog]]ing is a [[title (publishing)|title]] assigned to a work which either has no title or has appeared under more than one title. It is part of [[authority control]]. The phrases ''conventional title'' and ''standard title'' are sometimes used;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ei=dB4jSL7UPIuCyQS9uLS-Bg&amp;sig=jXt0DxUlSbKRDRSdQ_QT66tQDTQ#PPA662,M1 |title=Harrod's Librarians' Glossary and Reference Book: A Directory of Over 10,200 ... - Raymond John Prytherch |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Description and Access]] uses ''preferred title''; and the 2009 Statement of International Cataloguing Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/icp/ICP-2009_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=STATEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUING PRINCIPLES |publisher=Ifla.org |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; deprecates it in favour of ''authorized access point''.

There are many instances in which a uniform title can be used. Anonymous works such as [[sacred texts]] and [[Folklore|folk tales]] may lack an obvious title: for instance, the [[Bible]], ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', ''[[Beowulf]]'' or the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]''. [[Works of art]] and [[music]] may contain no text that can be used for reference. A uniform title allows all of the works to fall under one title and will reference all of the items to which the uniform title applies.

For example, if a library has 10 copies of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', each in a different language, an [[OPAC|online library catalogue]] can display all of the copies of the book together under the chosen uniform title. The library could also list any copies of ''Crime and Punishment'' in other media, such as film adaptations or abridged editions, under the same uniform title. This can help a library patron when searching the online catalog find all of the versions of ''Crime and Punishment'' at once instead of searching for each foreign title or film individually.

Uniform titles are particularly useful when cataloguing music, where pieces of music are often known by multiple valid titles and those titles are known in multiple languages, or when an individual work has been adapted as a [[contrafactum]].

The [[Library of Congress]] provides an example of how books of the [[New Testament]] are referred to in the [[AACR2|Anglo-American Cataloging Rules]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:- Bible. N.T. Acts
:- Bible. N.T. Colossians
:- Bible. N.T. Corinthians, 1st
:- Bible. N.T. Corinthians, 2nd
:- Bible. N.T. Ephesians ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/help/series-ut.htm |title=Series/Uniform Title Browse Help (Library of Congress Online Catalog) |publisher=Catalog.loc.gov |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Example:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;edition being cataloged: Othello / William Shakespeare&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;established uniform title: Shakespeare, William ... Othello&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;no uniform title assigned to the edition being cataloged&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Example:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;edition being cataloged: The tempest / William Shakespeare&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;established uniform title: Shakespeare, William ... Tempest&lt;/blockquote&gt;The complementary situation occurs with a single work that exists with more than one title, especially when [[translation|translated]] into another language, [[abridgement|excerpted]] or collected with other works. In this case, the name of the language or a phrase such as 'Selections' is added to distinguish works with the same uniform title.

The [[MARC standards|MARC 21]] standard uses fields 240, 243, 630, 730 and 830 for uniform titles.

'''Xena''' is [[open-source software]] for use in [[digital preservation]]. Xena is short for XML Electronic Normalising for Archives.

Xena is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]]. It is available free of charge under the [[GNU General Public License]].

Version 6.1.0 was released 31 July 2013. Source code and binaries for Linux, OS X and Windows are available from [[SourceForge]].

==Mode of operation==
Xena attempts to avoid [[digital obsolescence]] by converting files into an openly specified format, such as [[OpenDocument|ODF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]. If the file format is not supported or the Binary Normalisation option is selected, Xena will perform [[ASCII]] [[Base64]] encoding on binary files and wrap the output in XML metadata. The resulting .xena file is plain text, although the content of the data itself is not directly human-readable. The exact original file can be retrieved by stripping the metadata and reversing the Base64 encoding, using an internal viewer.

==Features==
Platforms supported by Xena are [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]].

Xena uses a series of plugins to identify file formats and convert them to an appropriate openly specified format.

Xena has an [[application programming interface]] which allows any reasonably skilled Java developer to develop a plugin to cover a new file type.

Xena can process individual files or whole directories. When processing a whole directory, it can preserve the original directory structure of the converted records.

Xena can create plain text versions of file formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], with the use of [[Tesseract (software)]].

The Xena interface or Xena Viewer can be used to view or export a Xena file (extension .xena) in its target file format. These files contain the normalised file as well as any extra information relevant to the normalisation process.
The Xena Viewer supports bulk export of Xena files to target file formats.

Xena can be used via its [[graphical user interface]] or the [[command line]].

For Xena to be fully functional, it requires a local installation of the following external software:
*[[LibreOffice]] suite - to convert office documents to OpenDocument format
*[[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] - to create plain text versions of file formats
*[[ImageMagick]] - to convert a subset of image files to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]
*Readpst - to convert [[Microsoft Outlook]] PST files to XML. Readpst is part of the free and open source [http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/ libpst software suite].
*[[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] - to convert audio files to FLAC format. This is also required to play back audio files using Xena.

==Supported file types==
Xena will recognize and process the file types listed below, plus a few others of minor importance. Unsupported file types will automatically undergo binary normalization.

Office file formats:
*[[Microsoft Office]] files (including [[Microsoft Office XML formats|MS Office XML]], [[SYLK]] spreadsheets and [[Rich Text Format]]) are converted to the corresponding OpenDocument files
*[[Microsoft Outlook]] [[Personal Storage Table|PST]] files are parsed for their individual messages, which are converted to XML files and a Xena index file is created
*[[Microsoft Project]] MPP files are converted to XML
*[[OpenOffice.org XML]] files (SXC, SXI, SXW) are converted to the corresponding OpenDocument formats
*[[WordPerfect]] WPD files are converted to OpenDocument ODT
*[[OpenDocument]] documents (ODT, ODS, ODB, ODP) are preserved unchanged
*Acrobat PDF files are stored as binaries
*Mailbox files (MBX) are converted to individual XML files

Graphics:
*[[BMP file format|BMP]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Adobe Photoshop|PSD]], [[PCX]], [[.ras|RAS]], and the [[X Window System]] [[X BitMap|XBM]] and [[X PixMap|XPM]] bitmap files are converted to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]; [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] files additionally get embedded metadata stored in Xena XML. If the [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] [[Optical character recognition|OCR software]] is installed, text will be extracted from TIFF files.
*OpenDocument Drawings (ODG) and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files are wrapped in Xena XML
*JPG and PNG files are stored unchanged

Archive Files:
*Files are extracted from [[File archiver|archives]] ([[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[gzip|GZIP]], [[tar (file format)|TAR/TAR.gz]], [[JAR (file format)|JAR]], [[WAR (Sun file format)|WAR]], Mac binary) and normalised into a separate Xena file. A Xena index file is created, which when opened in the internal Xena viewer will display the files in a table.

Audio files:
*[[MP3]], [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], and [[Vorbis|OGG]] formats are converted to [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] files.

Databases:
*[[SQL]] files are processed as plain text wrapped in XML

Other file types:
*HTML is converted to XHTML
*TXT text files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML; CSS files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML

==Reviews==
An April 22, 2010 review in Practical e-Records rated Xena at 82/100 points. At present Xena has no target preservation format for video files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-records.chrisprom.com/review-of-xena-normalization-software/ |title=Review of XENA Normalization Software |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://archive.is/yKw1 |archivedate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
