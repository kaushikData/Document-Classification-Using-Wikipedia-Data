'''Saint Abanoub''' or '''Abanoub Al-Nahisy''', ({{lang-cop|'''Ⲁⲃⲃⲁ Ⲁⲡⲁⲛⲟⲩⲃ'''}}) is a 4th-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]] and [[martyr]] from [[Egypt]]. His name means Father of Gold in Coptic. He was born in Nehisa in the [[Nile Delta]] to Christian parents. Abanoub was 12 years old when he was killed and beheaded, after being tortured for refusing to leave [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmary-church.com/saint_abanoub_2003.htm |title=Saint Abanoub 2003 |publisher=Stmary-church.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His feast day is July 31 ([[Epip]] 24). His relics are preserved in St.Virgin Mary and St.Abanoub Churches in [[Sebennytos]], Egypt. His title is often ''The Child Martyr.''

==Story of The Holy Martyr Saint Abanoub==
Saint Abanoub was born in the city of Nehisa (District of [[Talkha]]). He was the only son of parents who reared him in the fear of God. They died when Abanoub was a young child. At age twelve, Abanoub entered the church to hear the priest asking the congregation to remain faithful during the persecutions provoked by Diocletian, the Roman emperor.&lt;ref Name=cocn/&gt; Abanoub received the Holy Sacraments, then he prayed to God to guide him to where he could confess his faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cccnet.ca/Saints_Stories/St_Abanoub.htm |title=Saint Abanoub the Nehissan|publisher=Canadian Coptic Centre|date=|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to his house, and straight away he rose up, and gave all the gold, silver, and apparel his father had left him to the poor and needy, then went to Samanoud, walking along the river bank. On the way, he had a vision of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], who told him that he would suffer at Samanoud.&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stabanoub-dallas.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52:saint-abanoub&amp;catid=42:Cop_Saints_cat&amp;Itemid=55|title=Saint Abanoub|website=stabanoub-dallas.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed the Name of the Lord Christ before Lucianus the governor. Abanoub also insulted Lucianus's idols such that the governor ruler became furious and gave orders that the child be whipped. The soldiers beat Abanoub severely, but the Archangel Michael miraculously healed him.

On the following day, the governor took Abanoub on a boat to a city called [[Athribis]], and as a form of punishment, the young saint was hung upside down from the mast. The soldiers, along with their ruler, began to drink and dance, while hitting Abanoub on the mouth. Abanoub's nose bled, but then, unexpectedly, the soldiers became blind and the ruler paralyzed. The soldiers cried to Abanoub to pray for them and promised to become Christians. Saint Abanoub replied, "This will only happen in Athribis, so that everyone there should know that there is no other God but Christ".&lt;ref name=dallas/&gt; The angel of the Lord came down from heaven, released the saint, and wiped up the blood that was running down from his nose and mouth. Strong winds brought them swiftly to Athribis. When they arrived in Athribis, the soldiers were healed, and they cast their uniforms in front of the ruler of Athribis. The governor became infuriated and ordered that they all be killed. The governor of Athribis tortured Abanoub severely, then sent him to the city of [[Alexandria]]. There he was tortured until he delivered  up his soul and received the crown of martyrdom.&lt;ref name="cocn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/synexarion/abanoub.html|title=St. Abanoub|website=www.copticchurch.net|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Julius El-Akfahsi, who wrote the biography of St. Abanoub, was present. He took Abanoub's body and sent it with some of his men to Abanoub's hometown, Nehisa.

==Veneration==
In 960 AD, St. Abanoub’s body was transferred to St. Virgin Mary Church in Samanoud.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20140217050035/http://www.stmarkboston.org/The-Saints/st-abanoub.html|title=St. Abanoub {{!}} The Saints {{!}} The Church|date=2014-02-17|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches were built in his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''Adranika''' is a fictional race introduced in the [[GMA Network|GMA]] TV Series - [[Mars Ravelo's Darna]].  The TV series is produced by GMA in cooperation with the Estate of Mars Ravelo and [[Mango Comics]]. The term "Adranika" is based on the term "[[Adarna Warriors]]" which was coined in the Mango Comics [[Darna]] comicbook mini-series. The Adranikas were led by [[Queen Adran]] and her loyal right-hand person Aio.  They were under siege from the evil Anomalka, led by their queen of darkness, [[Braguda]] in the planet of Marte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darna2005tvseries.blogspot.com/ MARS RAVELO'S DARNA 2005 TV SERIES]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original "Darna" series by Mars Ravelo specifically states that Darna is from the "Planet Marte", the term "Adranika" (describing Darna's race) was NOT created by Mars Ravelo.

== Overview ==

Fighting for survival, Adran decided to send off Aio on a mission to find a worthy medium for the magical "white stone" to be given to someone with a pure heart to transform into Darna, the savior and the symbol of the Adranika race. Aio boards a space ship to Earth, and moments later, the planet Marte is destroyed.

With Braguda's ship right behind her, Aio is forced to make a crash landing on Earth. Little did she know that Braguda also landed on Earth, ready to take possession of the mystic stone.

The Race of Adranika together with Anomalka was destroyed including Queen Adran. Aio and Queen Braguda manages to escape and went to Earth to give the white stone to the chosen one, Narda while manages to get the stone and combine its power to her black stone to convert all humans to Anomalkans and terraform the planet into a New Planet Marte.

It was later revealed that there were some Adranikan survivors who managed to escape the destruction of the Planet Marte and had colonized a new one in a distant solar system.

Without Queen Adran to guide them, the remaining misguided survivors of the Adranika race had its own intentions to reshape the Planet Earth into its "perfect image."  But Darna eventually prevailed even against her own benefactors and the Earth was left to chart its own future.

'''Andriamanelo''' ([[Floruit|''fl.'']] 1540&amp;ndash;1575) was King of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Alasora|Alasora]] in the central highlands region of [[Madagascar]].  He is generally considered by historians to be the founder of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] and originator of the Merina royal line that, by the 19th century, had extended its rule over virtually all of Madagascar. The son of a [[Vazimba]] mother and a man of the newly arrived [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] people originating in [[Anosy|southeast Madagascar]], Andriamanelo ultimately led a series of military campaigns against the Vazimba, beginning a several-decade process to drive them from the Highlands. The conflict that defined his reign also produced many lasting innovations, including the development of fortified villages in the highlands and the use of iron weapons. Oral tradition furthermore credits Andriamanelo with establishing a ruling class of nobles (''[[andriana]]'') and defining the rules of succession. Numerous cultural traditions, including the ritual of circumcision, the wedding custom of ''vodiondry'' and the art of Malagasy astrology (''sikidy'') are likewise associated with this king.

==Early life==
Andriamanelo was the oldest son of the reigning [[Vazimba]] queen (alternately given in the oral histories as [[Rafohy]] or [[Rangita]]) and her [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] husband Manelobe, who may have had origins in the Zafiraminia people of [[Anosy]].&lt;ref name = RJ142&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the marriage between Rafohy and Manelobe, the Hova were a minority clan who had recently moved into the Vazimba-dominated highlands from their ancestral homeland in the southeast.&lt;ref name = Kus&gt;Kus (1982), pp. 47&amp;ndash;62&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced two sons, Andriamanelo and his younger brother Andriamananitany, as well as a sister named Rafotsindrindramanjaka. In a bid to counteract further fracturing of their kingdom, Rafohy and Rangita decided that while the Vazimba had historically been ruled by queens, Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.&lt;ref name = Kus/&gt; This system of succession, ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, was called ''fanjakana arindra'' ("organized government") and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child. The queen gave the village of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Alasora|Alasora]] to Andriamanelo to rule as his territory while she still lived, while Andriamananitany was given the village of Ambohitrandriananahary.&lt;ref&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[File:Imerina countryside riziere rice paddies Madagascar.jpg|thumb|alt=colorful rice paddies cover rolling hills|Andriamanelo waged war against the Vazimba in an effort to expel them from the highlands.]]
Among the distinguishing features of Andriamanelo's reign was the expansion of his territory around the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina|sacred hill]] of Alasora through a military campaign against the Vazimba to push these legendary, primitive first settlers of Madagascar toward the west of the island. After Andriamanelo had successfully expanded his kingdom to include Alasora to the south and [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Imerimanjaka|Merimanjaka]] to the north, the continued presence of a Vazimba stronghold at [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Analamanga|Analamanga]] (located between the two halves of his realm and effectively separating them) posed too great a threat to the unity of his kingdom to allow the situation to stand. He resolved to capture Analamanga and drive the Vazimba from his territory, an ambition partially realized during his reign.&lt;ref name = DV62/&gt; Popular legend attributes Andriamanelo's military successes to several innovations, including the discovery of iron smelting and propagation of the iron-tipped spear &lt;ref&gt;Ogot (1992), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; against the Vazimba who fought with weapons of clay.&lt;ref name="Kent93"&gt;Kent (1970), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He also fortified his capital at Alasora by creating ''[[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|hadivory]]'' (dry moats), ''hadifetsy'' (defensive trenches) and ''vavahady'' (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier), thereby rendering the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks. However, his attempt to establish [[Merina]] dominance in the central Highlands was thwarted when he proved unable to seize Analamanga;&lt;ref name = DV62&gt;de la Vassière &amp; Abinal (1885), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; this Vazimba stronghold would not fall until at last conquered by Andriamanelo's grandson, [[Andrianjaka]].&lt;ref&gt;You (1905), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfare was not the only strategy by which Andriamanelo sought to expand the territory under his control. Several years into his reign (after the death of his younger brother) Andriamanelo married a maternal cousin named Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest") who was a princess through her astrologer father, King Rabiby (for whom his capital, the village of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Ambohidrabiby|Ambohidrabiby]], is named), and her mother Ivorombe who is described in legends as a Vazimba water goddess. Through this union Andriamanelo ensured he would become master of the lands around Ambohidrabiby upon the death of his wife's father.&lt;ref name = DV62/&gt; Ramaitsoanala took the name Randapavola upon her marriage and then became known as Queen Rasolobe upon the birth of the couple's seventh and final son, [[Ralambo]]&amp;mdash;the only one of Andriamanelo's children to survive to adulthood. Six earlier pregnancies ended in stillbirth or the death of the child in infancy.&lt;ref name="Ark"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Buyers |first=Christopher |title=The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty 1 |publisher=www.royalark.net |year=2008 |url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina.htm |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xfbzML5C?url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriamanelo is typically portrayed as a civilizing king in contrast to the primitive Vazimba against whom he waged war. As such, oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology (''sikidy'') in addition to iron working. He reputedly introduced knowledge about the construction and use of [[pirogue]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Piolet (1895), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora.&lt;ref&gt;Rafidinarivo (2009), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century.

Many of the innovations attributed to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba,&lt;ref&gt;Radimilahy (1993), pp. 478&amp;ndash;483&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in [[Imerina]] to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Madatana |title=Alasora: Royaume d'Andriamanelo et terre des Velondraiamandreny |publisher=www.madatana.com |year=2011 |url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |accessdate=November 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xfc6eB32?url=http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php |archivedate=April 3, 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules of succession===
[[File:Ambohimanga 08.jpg|thumb|alt=red earthen wall |Alasora was the first highland village to be fortified to protect inhabitants throughout Andriamanelo's war with the Vazimba.]]
Andriamanelo's antecedents, Rafohy and Rangita, had jointly decreed a system of social order whereby the designated heir should have a younger sibling who would succeed him. However, this decree proved challenging upon the first instance of its application. According to oral tradition, upon Rafohy's designation of elder son Andriamanelo as her successor, her younger son Andriamananitany initially claimed to accept her decree. However, Andriamananitany soon began building a new village immodestly named Ambohitrandriamanitra ("Village of God") and copied the system of fortifications introduced by his older brother at Alasora, reportedly constructing them even faster than Andriamanelo. Word spread that Andriamananitany wished to undermine his older brother's rule. Upon learning of Andriamanelo's consequent wrath, Andriamananitany promptly abandoned his "Village of God" and sought permission from his brother to build a village called Ambohimanoa ("Village of Submission") where, according to one version of the oral history, he may have imprudently attempted to construct another defensive trench.&lt;ref&gt;de la Vassière &amp; Abinal (1885), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this provocative behavior, Andriamanantany was murdered by a group of [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]], possibly at Andriamanelo's command.&lt;ref name = RJ241&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), pp. 241&amp;ndash;242&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumed with remorse, the king sought to rectify the situation by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him.&lt;ref name = RJ238&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over in the line of succession in favor of [[Andrianjaka]], Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka.&lt;ref name=Ark2&gt;{{Cite web|last=Buyers |first=Christopher |title=The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty: Imerina 2 |url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wcscsZk3?url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Rowlands (1989), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.&lt;ref name = Kus/&gt;

===Vodiondry===
The marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry&amp;mdash;meat from the hindquarters of a sheep&amp;mdash;which he believed to be the tastiest portion.&lt;ref name="Kent308"&gt;Kent (1970), pp. 308&amp;ndash;309&lt;/ref&gt; The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic [[piastre]], sums of money and other gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grandidier | first = Guillaume | title = Le mariage à Madagascar | journal = Bulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris | volume = 4 | pages = 9&amp;ndash;46 | year = 1913 |url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 |accessdate = April 3, 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 | dead-url = no |archivedate = December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==
[[File:Tomb of Andriamanelo in Alasora Madagascar.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Andriamanelo in Alasora]]
Andriamanelo ruled until his death at an advanced age around 1575 and was succeeded by his only surviving son, Ralambo.&lt;ref name="Ark" /&gt; He was buried in Alasora in an earthen ditch. According to oral tradition, the placement of his tomb may have been to the south-east of the royal compound rather than to the north as was customary. This anomaly may have been intended to symbolically indicate Andriamanelo's "otherness" as a man of mixed ethnic background.&lt;ref name="RJ142" /&gt; A similar tomb to the north of the Alasora compound may have been that of Andriamanelo's mother. These two earthen tombs are considered the oldest known royal-style tombs in Imerina.&lt;ref&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">'''Biobased economy''', '''bioeconomy''' or '''biotechonomy''' refers to all economic activity derived from scientific and research activity focused on [[biotechnology]].  In other words, understanding mechanisms and processes at the genetic and molecular levels and applying this understanding to creating or improving industrial processes.

The term is widely used by regional development agencies, international organizations, biotechnology companies. It is closely linked to the evolution of the biotechnology industry. The ability to study, understand and manipulate genetic material has been possible due to scientific breakthroughs and technological progress.

The evolution of the biotechnology industry and its application to agriculture, health, chemical or energy industries is a classic example of bioeconomic activity.&lt;ref name="Smyth-2011"&gt;Smyth, S. J., Aerni, P., Castle, D., Demont, M., Falck-Zepeda, J. B., Paarlberg, R., Phillips, P. W. B., Pray, C. E., Savastano, S., [[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J., Zilberman, D. (2011). Sustainability and the bioeconomy: Policy recommendations from the 15th ICABR conference. ''AgBioForum'', 14(3), 180-186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wesseler-2011"&gt;[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J., D. S. Spielman, M. Demont (eds.) (2011): The Future of Governance in the Global Bioeconomy: Policy, Regulation, and Investment Challenges for the Biotechnology and Bioenergy Sectors. ''AgBioForum'', 13(4), 288-290&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was used by [[Juan Enríquez]] and Rodrigo Martinez at the [[Genomics Seminar]] in the 1997 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] meeting. An excerpt of this paper was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Enríquez-Cabot, Juan. "Genomics and the World's Economy." ''Science'' 281 (14 August 1998): 925-926.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enríquez and Martinez' 2002 Harvard Business School working paper, "Biotechonomy 1.0: A Rough Map of Biodata Flow", showed the global flow of genetic material into and out of the three largest public genetic databases: [[GenBank]], [[EMBL]] and [[DDBJ]]. The authors then hypothesized about the economic impact that such data flows might have on patent creation, evolution of biotech startups and licensing fees.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Enríquez, Rodrigo Martinez. "Biotechonomy 1.0: A Rough Map of Biodata Flow", Harvard Business School working paper # 03-028, August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of this paper was published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigo Martinez, Juan Enríquez, Jonathan West. "DNA Space. The Geography of the Genome", ''Wired'', June 2003. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, the creation of a biobased economy has been a significant issue in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biobasedeconomy.nl/ Biobased economy.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot plants have been started i.e. in Lelystad ([[Zeafuels]]), and a centralised organisation exists (Interdepartementaal programma biobased economy), with supporting research (Food &amp; Biobased Research) being conducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duurzameenergiethuis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/acrres_afbeelding.jpg Schematic showing the biomass and processes used in Zeafuels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050549/http://www.duurzameenergiethuis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/acrres_afbeelding.jpg |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Presidency of Barack Obama|president Barack Obama]] of the USA announced intentions to encourage biological manufacturing methods, with a National Bioeconomy Blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/energy-environment/white-house-promotes-a-bioeconomy.html White House Promotes a Bioeconomy] April 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year in Belgium the Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant was set up.&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
{{See also|Cellulosic_ethanol#Production_methods|Biofuel#Second_generation_biofuels_.28advanced_biofuels.29|Ethanol_fermentation}}

The biobased economy uses first-generation [[biomass]] (crops), second-generation biomass (crop refuge), and third-generation biomass (seaweed, algae). Several methods of processing are then used (in [[Biorefinery|biorefineries]]) to gather the most out of the biomass. This includes techniques such as
* [[Anaerobic digestion]]
* [[Pyrolysis]]
* [[Torrefaction]]
* [[Industrial fermentation|Fermentation]]

Anaerobic digestion is generally used to produce [[biogas]], fermentation of sugars produces [[ethanol]], pyrolysis is used to produce [[pyrolysis-oil]] (which is solidified biogas), and torrefaction is used to create '''biomass-coal'''. Biomass-coal and biogas is then burnt for energy production, ethanol can be used as a (vehicle)-fuel, as well as for other purposes, such as [[skincare]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrres.nl/ ACCRES]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Getting the most out of the biomass==
For economic reasons, the processing of the biomass is done according to a specific pattern. This pattern, as well as the quantities, depends on the types of biomass used. The whole of finding the most suitable pattern is known as [[biorefining]]. A general list shows the products with high added value and lowest volume of biomass to the products with the lowest added value and highest volume of biomass:&lt;ref&gt;Kijk magazine, number 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* fine chemicals/medicines
* food
* chemicals/bioplastics
* transport fuels
* electricity and heat

Some research is being conducted as well in order to improve the manufacturing processes. For example, to make plastics, paint, medicines, antifreeze out of [[syngas]], a new catalyst has been invented by Krijn de Jong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kijk.nl/nieuws/nederlandse-vinding-maakt-plastic-van-planten/ New catalyst for making plastics, paint, medicines, antifreeze out of syngas]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared to fossil fuel economy ==
* With a fossil fuel economy substances as gasoline, fuel oil, diesel, naphta, kerosine, LPG, and other are converted to: energy, chemical products, food, materials
* With a biobased economy substances as (syn)gas, sugars, oil, fibres and other are converted to energy, chemical products, (animal) food, biomaterials

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45140">'''CMA-ES''' stands for ''covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy''. [[Evolution strategies]] (ES) are [[stochastic]], [[Derivative-free optimization|derivative-free methods]] for [[numerical optimization]]  of non-[[Linear map|linear]] or non-[[Convex function|convex]] [[continuous optimization]] problems. They belong to the class of [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[evolutionary computation]].  An [[evolutionary algorithm]] is broadly based on the principle of [[biological evolution]], namely the repeated interplay of variation (via recombination and mutation) and selection: in each generation (iteration) new individuals (candidate solutions, denoted as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) are generated by variation, usually in a stochastic way, of the current parental individuals. Then, some individuals are selected to become the parents in the next generation based on their fitness or [[objective function]] value &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Like this, over the generation sequence, individuals with better and better &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-values are generated.

In an [[evolution strategy]], new candidate solutions are sampled according to a [[multivariate normal distribution]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Recombination amounts to selecting a new mean value for the distribution. Mutation amounts to adding a random vector, a perturbation with zero mean. Pairwise dependencies between the variables in the distribution are represented by a [[covariance matrix]]. The covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) is a method to update the [[covariance matrix]] of this distribution. This is particularly useful if the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[ill-conditioned]].

Adaptation of the [[covariance matrix]] amounts to learning a second order model of the underlying [[objective function]] similar to the approximation of the inverse [[Hessian matrix]] in the [[Quasi-Newton method]] in classical [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. In contrast to most classical methods, fewer assumptions on the nature of the underlying objective function are made. Only the ranking between candidate solutions is exploited for learning the sample distribution and neither derivatives nor even the function values themselves are required by the method.

== Principles ==
[[Image:Concept of directional optimization in CMA-ES algorithm.png|thumb|right|400px|Illustration of an actual optimization run with covariance matrix adaptation on a simple two-dimensional problem. The spherical optimization landscape is depicted with solid lines of equal &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-values. The population (dots) is much larger than necessary, but clearly shows how the distribution of the population (dotted line) changes during the optimization. On this simple problem, the population concentrates over the global optimum within a few generations.]]
Two main principles for the adaptation of parameters of the search distribution are exploited in the CMA-ES algorithm.

First, a [[maximum-likelihood]] principle, based on the idea to increase the probability of successful candidate solutions and search steps. The mean of the distribution is updated such that the [[likelihood]] of previously successful candidate solutions is maximized. The [[covariance matrix]] of the distribution is updated (incrementally) such that the likelihood of previously successful search steps is increased. Both updates can be interpreted as a [[Information geometry#Natural gradient|natural gradient]] descent. Also, in consequence, the CMA conducts an iterated [[principal components analysis]] of successful search steps while retaining ''all'' principal axes. [[Estimation of Distribution Algorithms|Estimation of distribution algorithms]] and the [[Cross-Entropy Method]] are based on very similar ideas, but estimate (non-incrementally) the covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood of successful solution ''points'' instead of successful search ''steps''.

Second, two paths of the time evolution of the distribution mean of the strategy are recorded, called search or evolution paths. These paths contain significant information about the correlation between consecutive steps. Specifically, if consecutive steps are taken in a similar direction, the evolution paths become long. The evolution paths are exploited in two ways. One path is used for the covariance matrix adaptation procedure in place of single successful search steps and facilitates a possibly much faster variance increase of favorable directions. The other path is used to conduct an additional step-size control. This step-size control aims to make consecutive movements of the distribution mean orthogonal in expectation. The step-size control effectively prevents [[premature convergence]] yet allowing fast convergence to an optimum.

== Algorithm ==
In the following the most commonly used (μ/μ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, λ)-CMA-ES is outlined, where in each iteration step a weighted combination of the μ best out of λ new candidate solutions is used to update the distribution parameters. The main loop consists of three main parts: 1) sampling of new solutions, 2) re-ordering of the sampled solutions based on their fitness, 3) update of the internal state variables based on the re-ordered samples. A [[pseudocode]] of the algorithm looks as follows.

  '''set''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;  // number of samples per iteration, at least two, generally &gt; 4
  '''initialize''' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C=I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_c=0&lt;/math&gt;  // initialize state variables

  '''return''' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

The order of the five update assignments is relevant. In the following, the update equations for the five state variables are specified.

Given are the search space dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the iteration step &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The five state variables are

: &lt;math&gt;m_k\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the distribution mean and current favorite solution to the optimization problem,

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the step-size,

: &lt;math&gt; C_k&lt;/math&gt;, a symmetric and [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[covariance matrix]] with &lt;math&gt; C_0 = I&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt; p_\sigma\in\mathbb{R}^n, p_c\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, two evolution paths, initially set to the zero vector.

The iteration starts with sampling &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; candidate solutions &lt;math&gt;x_i\in\mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; from a [[multivariate normal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathcal{N}(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. 
for &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x_i \ &amp;\sim\ \mathcal{N}(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k)      
     \\&amp;\sim\ m_k + \sigma_k\times\mathcal{N}(0,C_k) 
\end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

The second line suggests the interpretation as perturbation (mutation) of the current favorite solution vector &lt;math&gt;m_k&lt;/math&gt; (the distribution mean vector). The candidate solutions &lt;math&gt; x_i&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated on the objective function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to be minimized.  Denoting the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-sorted candidate solutions as

: &lt;math&gt;
    \{x_{i:\lambda}\;|\;i=1\dots\lambda\} = \{x_i\;|\;i=1\dots\lambda\} \;\;\text{and}\;\; 
     f(x_{1:\lambda})\le\dots\le f(x_{\mu:\lambda})\le f(x_{\mu+1:\lambda}) \dots,       
  &lt;/math&gt;

the new mean value is computed as

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  m_{k+1} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\mu} w_i\, x_{i:\lambda} 
  \\ &amp;= m_k + \sum_{i=1}^{\mu} w_i\, (x_{i:\lambda} - m_k) 
\end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

where the positive (recombination) weights &lt;math&gt; w_1 \ge w_2 \ge \dots \ge w_\mu &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; sum to one. Typically, &lt;math&gt;\mu \le \lambda/2&lt;/math&gt; and the weights are chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mu_w := 1 / \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i^2 \approx \lambda/4&lt;/math&gt;. The only feedback used from the objective function here and in the following is an ordering of the sampled candidate solutions due to the indices &lt;math&gt;i:\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The step-size &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is updated using ''cumulative step-size adaptation'' (CSA), sometimes also denoted as ''path length control''. The evolution path (or search path) &lt;math&gt;p_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is updated first.

:: &lt;math&gt;
  p_\sigma \gets \underbrace{(1-c_\sigma)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\text{discount factor}\!\!\!\!\!}\, p_\sigma 
    + \overbrace{\sqrt{1 - (1-c_\sigma)^2}}^{
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\text{complements for discounted variance}
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \underbrace{\sqrt{\mu_w} 
     \,C_k^{\;-1/2} \, \frac{\overbrace{m_{k+1} - m_k}^{\!\!\!\text{displacement of}\; m\!\!\!}}{\sigma_k}}_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
                      \text{distributed as}\; \mathcal{N}(0,I)\;\text{under neutral selection}
                      \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!}
  &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{k+1} = \sigma_k \times \exp\bigg(\frac{c_\sigma}{d_\sigma}
                          \underbrace{\left(\frac{\|p_\sigma\|}{E\|\mathcal{N}(0,I)\|} - 1\right)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
    \text{unbiased about 0 under neutral selection}
    \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
}\bigg)
  &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;c_\sigma^{-1}\approx n/3&lt;/math&gt; is the backward time horizon for the evolution path &lt;math&gt;p_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and larger than one (&lt;math&gt;c_\sigma \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; is reminiscent of an [[exponential decay]] constant as &lt;math&gt;(1-c_\sigma)^k\approx\exp(-c_\sigma k)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c_\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the associated lifetime and &lt;math&gt;c_\sigma^{-1}\ln(2)\approx0.7c_\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; the half-life),

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_w=\left(\sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i^2\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the variance effective selection mass and &lt;math&gt;1 \le \mu_w \le \mu&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;C_k^{\;-1/2} = \sqrt{C_k}^{\;-1} = \sqrt{C_k^{\;-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unique symmetric [[Square root of a matrix|square root]] of the [[Invertible matrix|inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;, and

: &lt;math&gt;d_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the damping parameter usually close to one. For &lt;math&gt;d_\sigma=\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c_\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt; the step-size remains unchanged.

The step-size &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is increased if and only if &lt;math&gt;\|p_\sigma\|&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the [[expected value]]

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}E\|\mathcal{N}(0,I)\| &amp;= \sqrt{2}\,\Gamma((n+1)/2)/\Gamma(n/2) 
  \\&amp;\approx \sqrt{n}\,(1-1/(4\,n)+1/(21\,n^2)) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and decreased if it is smaller. For this reason, the step-size update tends to make consecutive steps [[Conjugate gradient#The conjugate gradient method as a direct method|&lt;math&gt;C_k^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;-conjugate]], in that  after the adaptation has been successful &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left(\frac{m_{k+2}-m_{k+1}}{\sigma_{k+1}}\right)^T\! C_k^{-1} \frac{m_{k+1}-m_{k}}{\sigma_k} \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Finally, the [[covariance matrix]] is updated, where again the respective evolution path is updated first.

  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; denotes the transpose and

: &lt;math&gt;c_c^{-1}\approx n/4&lt;/math&gt; is the backward time horizon for the evolution path &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; and larger than one,

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx 1.5&lt;/math&gt; and the [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]}(\|p_\sigma\|)&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to one [[if and only if|iff]] &lt;math&gt;\|p_\sigma\|\in[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]&lt;/math&gt; or, in other words, &lt;math&gt;\|p_\sigma\|\le\alpha\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, which is usually the case,

: &lt;math&gt;c_s = (1 - \mathbf{1}_{[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]}(\|p_\sigma\|)^2) \,c_1 c_c (2-c_c) &lt;/math&gt; makes partly up for the small variance loss in case the indicator is zero,

: &lt;math&gt;c_1 \approx 2 / n^2&lt;/math&gt; is the learning rate for the rank-one update of the [[covariance matrix]] and

: &lt;math&gt;c_\mu \approx \mu_w / n^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the learning rate for the rank-&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; update of the [[covariance matrix]] and must not exceed &lt;math&gt;1 - c_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[covariance matrix]] update tends to increase the [[Likelihood function|likelihood]] for &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;(x_{i:\lambda} - m_k)/\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; to be sampled from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(0,C_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;. This completes the iteration step.

The number of candidate samples per iteration, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is not determined a priori and can vary in a wide range. Smaller values, for example &lt;math&gt;\lambda=10&lt;/math&gt;, lead to more local search behavior. Larger values, for example &lt;math&gt;\lambda=10n&lt;/math&gt; with default value &lt;math&gt;\mu_w \approx \lambda/4&lt;/math&gt;, render the search more global. Sometimes the algorithm is repeatedly restarted with increasing &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by a factor of two for each restart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Theoretical foundations ==
Given the distribution parameters&amp;mdash;mean, variances and covariances&amp;mdash;the [[multivariate normal distribution|normal probability distribution]] for sampling new candidate solutions is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the sample distribution with the minimal amount of prior information built into the distribution. More considerations on the update equations of CMA-ES are made in the following.

=== Variable metric ===
The CMA-ES implements a stochastic [[variable-metric]] method. In the very particular case of a convex-quadratic objective function

:: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(x-x^*)^T H (x-x^*)&lt;/math&gt;

the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; adapts to the inverse of the [[Hessian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, [[up to]] a scalar factor and small random fluctuations. More general, also on the function &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing and therefore order preserving and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex-quadratic, the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; adapts to &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, [[up to]] a scalar factor and small random fluctuations.

=== Maximum-likelihood updates ===

The update equations for mean and covariance matrix maximize a [[likelihood]] while resembling an [[Expectation maximization|expectation-maximization]] algorithm. The update of the mean vector &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; maximizes a log-likelihood, such that

:: &lt;math&gt; m_{k+1} = \arg\max_{m} \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \log p_\mathcal{N}(x_{i:\lambda} | m) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:: &lt;math&gt; \log p_\mathcal{N}(x) = 
   - \frac{1}{2} \log\det(2\pi C) - \frac{1}{2} (x-m)^T C^{-1} (x-m) &lt;/math&gt;

denotes the log-likelihood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from a multivariate normal distribution with mean &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and any positive definite covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. To see that &lt;math&gt;m_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; remark first that this is the case for any diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, because the coordinate-wise maximizer is independent of a scaling factor. Then, rotation of the data points or choosing &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; non-diagonal are equivalent.

The rank-&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; update of the covariance matrix, that is, the right most summand in the update equation of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;, maximizes a log-likelihood in that

:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} 
             \left( \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \right)^T 
     = \arg\max_{C} \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \log p_\mathcal{N}\left(\left.\frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \right| C\right) &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\mu\ge n&lt;/math&gt; (otherwise &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is singular, but substantially the same result holds for &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;). Here, &lt;math&gt; p_\mathcal{N}(x | C) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the likelihood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, for &lt;math&gt;c_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_\mu=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the above [[maximum-likelihood]] estimator. See [[estimation of covariance matrices]] for details on the derivation.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered independently that the update of the distribution parameters resembles the descent in direction of a sampled [[Information geometry#Natural gradient|natural gradient]] of the expected objective function value &lt;math&gt;E f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (to be minimized), where the expectation is taken under the sample distribution. With the parameter setting of &lt;math&gt;c_\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. without step-size control and rank-one update, CMA-ES can thus be viewed as an instantiation of [[Natural Evolution Strategies]] (NES).&lt;ref name=akimoto2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=glasmachers2010/&gt;
The [[Information geometry#Natural gradient|''natural'' gradient]] is independent of the parameterization of the distribution. Taken with respect to the parameters {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}} of the sample distribution {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}, the gradient of&lt;math&gt;E f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as

:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
  {\nabla}_{\!\theta} E(f(x) | \theta) 
     &amp;= \nabla_{\!\theta} \int_{\mathbb R^n}f(x) p(x) \mathrm{d}x
  \\ &amp;= \int_{\mathbb R^n}f(x) \nabla_{\!\theta} p(x) \mathrm{d}x
  \\ &amp;= \int_{\mathbb R^n}f(x) p(x) \nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x) \mathrm{d}x
  \\ &amp;= E(f(x) \nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x|\theta))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(x)=p(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; depends on the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The so-called [[Score (statistics)|score function]], &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x|\theta) = \frac{\nabla_{\!\theta} p(x)}{p(x)} &lt;/math&gt;, indicates the relative sensitivity of {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} w.r.t. {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/var&gt;}}, and the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}. The [[Information geometry#Natural gradient|''natural'' gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;E f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, complying with the [[Fisher information metric]] (an informational distance measure between probability distributions and the curvature of the [[relative entropy]]), now reads

:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
  \tilde{\nabla} E(f(x) | \theta) 
  &amp;= F^{-1}_\theta \nabla_{\!\theta} E(f(x) | \theta) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Fisher information]] matrix &lt;math&gt; F_{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; is the expectation of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of {{math|-ln&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} and renders the expression independent of the chosen parameterization. Combining the previous equalities we get

:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
  \tilde{\nabla} E(f(x) | \theta) 
  &amp;= F^{-1}_\theta E(f(x) \nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x|\theta))
  \\ &amp;= E(f(x) F^{-1}_\theta \nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x|\theta))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A Monte Carlo approximation of the latter expectation takes the average over {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/var&gt;}} samples from {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}

:: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\nabla} \widehat{E}_\theta(f) := -\sum_{i=1}^\lambda \overbrace{w_i}^{\!\!\!\!\text{preference weight}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \underbrace{F^{-1}_\theta \nabla_{\!\theta} \ln p(x_{i:\lambda}|\theta)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\text{candidate direction from }x_{i:\lambda}\!\!\!\!\!}
\quad\mathrm{with~}w_i = -f(x_{i:\lambda})/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;i:\lambda&lt;/math&gt; from above is used and therefore &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are monotonously decreasing in &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

finally found a rigorous derivation for the more robust weights, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;, as they are defined in the CMA-ES (weights are often zero for {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt; &gt; &lt;var&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/var&gt;}}). They are formulated as the consistent estimator for the [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]] of &lt;math&gt;f(X), X\sim p(.|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i:\lambda})&lt;/math&gt;, composed with a fixed monotonous decreased transformation &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, that is,

:: &lt;math&gt;w_i = w\left(\frac{\mathsf{rank}(f(x_{i:\lambda})) - 1/2}{\lambda}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This makes the algorithm insensitive to the specific &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-values. More concisely, using the [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]] estimator of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; itself let the algorithm only depend on the ranking of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-values but not on their underlying distribution. It renders the algorithm invariant to monotonous &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-transformations. Let

:: &lt;math&gt;\theta = [m_k^T \mathrm{vec}(C_k)^T \sigma_k]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n+n^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt; p(.|\theta) &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the [[multivariate normal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal N(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we have an explicit expression for the inverse of the Fisher information matrix where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is fixed

:: &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}_{\theta | \sigma_k} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_k^2 C_k&amp;0\\ 0&amp;2 C_k\otimes C_k\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and for

:: &lt;math&gt;\ln p(x|\theta) = \ln p(x|m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k) = -\frac{1}{2}(x-m_k)^T \sigma_k^{-2} C_k^{-1} (x-m_k) 
         \,-\, \frac{1}{2}\ln\det(2\pi\sigma_k^2 C_k)&lt;/math&gt;

and, after some calculations, the updates in the CMA-ES turn out as&lt;ref name=akimoto2010/&gt;

&lt;div id="update_in_gradient_formulation"&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
   m_{k+1} 
     &amp;= m_k - \underbrace{[\tilde{\nabla} \widehat{E}_\theta(f)]_{1,\dots, n}}_{
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
     \text{natural gradient for mean}
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
     } 
   \\
     &amp;= m_k + \sum_{i=1}^\lambda w_i (x_{i:\lambda} - m_k) 
   \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
   C_{k+1} 
     &amp;= C_k + c_1(p_c p_c^T - C_k)  
         - c_\mu\,\mathrm{mat}(\overbrace{[\tilde{\nabla} \widehat{E}_\theta(f)]_{n+1,\dots,n+n^2}}^{
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
        \text{natural gradient for covariance matrix} 
     \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
     })\\
     &amp;= C_k + c_1(p_c p_c^T - C_k) 
        + c_\mu \sum_{i=1}^\lambda w_i \left(\frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \left(\frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k}\right)^T - C_k\right) 
   \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

where mat forms the proper matrix from the respective natural gradient sub-vector. That means, setting &lt;math&gt;c_1=c_\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;, the CMA-ES updates descend in direction of the approximation &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\nabla} \widehat{E}_\theta(f)&lt;/math&gt; of the natural gradient while using different step-sizes (learning rates 1 and &lt;math&gt;c_\mu&lt;/math&gt;) for the [[Fisher information#Orthogonal parameters|orthogonal parameters]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The most recent version of CMA-ES also use a different function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with negative values only for the latter (so-called active CMA).

=== Stationarity or unbiasedness ===
It is comparatively easy to see that the update equations of CMA-ES satisfy some stationarity conditions, in that they are essentially unbiased. Under neutral selection, where &lt;math&gt;x_{i:\lambda} \sim \mathcal N(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k)&lt;/math&gt;,  we find that

:: &lt;math&gt; E(m_{k+1}\,|\, m_k) = m_k &lt;/math&gt;

and under some mild additional assumptions on the initial conditions

:: &lt;math&gt; E(\log \sigma_{k+1} \,|\, \sigma_k) = \log \sigma_k &lt;/math&gt;

and with an additional minor correction in the covariance matrix update for the case where the indicator function evaluates to zero, we find

:: &lt;math&gt; E(C_{k+1} \,|\, C_k) = C_k &lt;/math&gt;

=== Invariance ===
[[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariance properties]] imply uniform performance on a class of objective functions. They have been argued to be an advantage, because they allow to generalize and predict the behavior of the algorithm and therefore strengthen the meaning of empirical results obtained on single functions. The following invariance properties have been established for CMA-ES.

* Invariance under order-preserving transformations of the objective function value &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, in that for any &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; the behavior is identical on &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto g(h(x))&lt;/math&gt; for all strictly increasing &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This invariance is easy to verify, because only the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-ranking is used in the algorithm, which is invariant under the choice of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Scale-invariance]], in that for any &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; the behavior is independent of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for the objective function &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto h(\alpha x)&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0\propto1/\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_0\propto1/\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
* Invariance under rotation of the search space in that for any &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;z\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; the behavior on &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto h(R x)&lt;/math&gt;  is independent of the [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;m_0=R^{-1} z&lt;/math&gt;. More general, the algorithm is also invariant under general linear transformations &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; when additionally the initial covariance matrix is chosen as &lt;math&gt;R^{-1}{R^{-1}}^T&lt;/math&gt;.

Any serious parameter optimization method should be translation invariant, but most methods do not exhibit all the above described invariance properties. A prominent example with the same invariance properties is the [[Nelder–Mead method]], where the initial simplex must be chosen respectively.

=== Convergence ===

Conceptual considerations like the scale-invariance property of the algorithm, the analysis of simpler [[evolution strategies]], and overwhelming empirical evidence suggest that the algorithm converges on a large class of functions fast to the global optimum, denoted as &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;. On some functions, convergence occurs independently of the initial conditions with probability one. On some functions the probability is smaller than one and typically depends on the initial &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;. Empirically, the fastest possible convergence rate in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for rank-based direct search methods can often be observed (depending on the context denoted as ''[[Rate of convergence#linear convergence|linear]]'' or ''log-linear'' or ''exponential'' convergence). Informally, we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;\|m_k - x^*\| \;\approx\; \|m_0 - x^*\| \times e^{-ck}
   &lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and more rigorously

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k\log\frac{\|m_i - x^*\|}{\|m_{i-1} - x^*\|} 
   \;=\; \frac{1}{k}\log\frac{\|m_k - x^*\|}{\|m_{0} - x^*\|}
    \;\to\; -c &lt; 0 \quad\text{for}\; k\to\infty\;, 
   &lt;/math&gt;

or similarly,

:: &lt;math&gt;E\log\frac{\|m_k - x^*\|}{\|m_{k-1} - x^*\|}
    \;\to\; -c &lt; 0 \quad\text{for}\; k\to\infty\;. 
   &lt;/math&gt;

This means that on average the distance to the optimum decreases in each iteration by a "constant" factor, namely by &lt;math&gt;\exp(-c)&lt;/math&gt;. The convergence rate &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is roughly &lt;math&gt;0.1\lambda/n&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is not much larger than the dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Even with optimal &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the convergence rate &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  cannot largely exceed &lt;math&gt;0.25\lambda/n&lt;/math&gt;, given the above recombination weights &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are all non-negative. The actual linear dependencies in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are remarkable and they are in both cases the best one can hope for in this kind of algorithm. Yet, a rigorous proof of convergence is missing.

===Interpretation as coordinate-system transformation===
Using a non-identity covariance matrix for the [[multivariate normal distribution]] in [[evolution strategies]] is equivalent to a coordinate system transformation of the solution vectors,&lt;ref name=hansen2008 /&gt; mainly because the sampling equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x_i &amp;\sim\ m_k + \sigma_k\times\mathcal{N}(0,C_k)
    \\
  &amp;\sim\ m_k + \sigma_k \times C_k^{1/2}\mathcal{N}(0,I) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

can be equivalently expressed in an "encoded space" as 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \underbrace{C_k^{-1/2}x_i}_{\text{represented in the encode space}
    \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} 
     \sim\ \underbrace{C_k^{-1/2} m_k} {} + \sigma_k \times\mathcal{N}(0,I)
&lt;/math&gt;

The covariance matrix defines a [[bijective]] transformation (encoding) for all solution vectors into a space, where the sampling takes place with identity covariance matrix. Because the update equations in the CMA-ES are invariant under linear coordinate system transformations, the CMA-ES can be re-written as an adaptive encoding procedure applied to a simple [[evolution strategy]] with identity covariance matrix.&lt;ref name=hansen2008&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This adaptive encoding procedure is not confined to algorithms that sample from a multivariate normal distribution (like evolution strategies), but can in principle be applied to any iterative search method.

== Performance in practice ==

In contrast to most other [[evolutionary algorithms]], the CMA-ES is, from the user's perspective, quasi parameter-free. The user has to choose an initial solution point, &lt;math&gt;m_0\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and the initial step-size, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Optionally, the number of candidate samples λ (population size) can be modified by the user in order to change the characteristic search behavior (see above) and termination conditions can or should be adjusted to the problem at hand.

The CMA-ES has been empirically successful in hundreds of applications and is considered to be useful in particular on non-convex, non-separable, ill-conditioned, multi-modal or noisy objective functions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~nikolaus.hansen/cmaapplications.pdf|title=References to CMA-ES Applications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The search space dimension ranges typically between two and a few hundred. Assuming a black-box optimization scenario, where gradients are not available (or not useful) and function evaluations are the only considered cost of search, the CMA-ES method is likely to be outperformed by other methods in the following conditions:

* on low-dimensional functions, say &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 5 &lt;/math&gt;, for example by the [[Nelder-Mead method|downhill simplex method]] or surrogate-based methods (like [[kriging]] with expected improvement);
* on separable functions without or with only negligible dependencies between the design variables in particular in the case of multi-modality or large dimension, for example by [[differential evolution]];
* on (nearly) [[Convex function|convex]]-quadratic functions with low or moderate [[condition number]] of the [[Hessian matrix]], where [[BFGS method|BFGS]] or [[NEWUOA]] are typically ten times faster;
* on functions that can already be solved with a comparatively small number of function evaluations, say no more than &lt;math&gt;10 n&lt;/math&gt;, where CMA-ES is often slower than, for example, [[NEWUOA]] or [[MCS algorithm|Multilevel Coordinate Search]] (MCS).

On separable functions, the performance disadvantage is likely to be most significant in that CMA-ES might not be able to find at all comparable solutions. On the other hand, on non-separable functions that are ill-conditioned or rugged or can only be solved with more than &lt;math&gt;100 n&lt;/math&gt; function evaluations, the CMA-ES shows most often superior performance.

== Variations and extensions ==
The (1+1)-CMA-ES&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; generates only one candidate solution per iteration step which becomes the new distribution mean if it is better than the current mean. For &lt;math&gt;c_c=1&lt;/math&gt; the (1+1)-CMA-ES is a close variant of [[Gaussian adaptation]]. Some [[Natural Evolution Strategies]] are close variants of the CMA-ES with specific parameter settings. Natural Evolution Strategies do not utilize evolution paths (that means in CMA-ES setting &lt;math&gt;c_c=c_\sigma=1&lt;/math&gt;) and they formalize the update of variances and covariances on a [[Cholesky decomposition|Cholesky factor]] instead of a covariance matrix. The CMA-ES has also been extended to [[multiobjective optimization]] as MO-CMA-ES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Carnage''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #360.&lt;ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_360|title=Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 360|work=Marvel Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnage was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artists [[Erik Larsen]] and [[Mark Bagley]]. The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. He is usually depicted as an adversary to [[Spider-Man]], as well as serving as the archenemy of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host from [[Earth-616]] is '''[[Cletus Kasady]]''', a serial killer from the Marvel Universe. [[Norman Osborn]] and his grandson [[Normie Osborn]] have also used the symbiote and have been referred to as the '''Red Goblin'''. 

In 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|title=Carnage is number 90|work=Comics|publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715065142/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|archivedate=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage because he wanted to make a darker version of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]],&lt;ref name="SM: Carnage"&gt;''Spider-Man: Carnage''&lt;/ref&gt; intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character: a total psychopath who, unlike Venom, had no sense of morality. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"&lt;ref name="Wizard"&gt;''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage". Carnage's human component, Cletus Kasady, was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]], who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (character)|the Joker]].&lt;ref name="Cletus Kasady question"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread) |accessdate=2007-06-24 |author=Erik Larsen |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Image Comics Community |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210624/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote.

[[Cletus Kasady]] was introduced in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #361.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cowsill|first = Alan|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 197|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Artist Mark Bagley's era of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' hit its stride as Carnage revealed the true face of his evil.

In 1996, two one-shot comics entirely about Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

After a 2004 appearance in ''[[List of New Avengers story arcs#Breakout (Issues #1-6)|New Avengers]]'' the character was presumed dead and was absent from comics for nearly six years. A 2010–2011 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''Carnage'' featured the return of the symbiote, where it temporarily found a new female host before reuniting with Kasady.&lt;ref name="Carnage Female Host"&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=Richard|title=SDCC 10: The Return of Carnage|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/07/25/sdcc-10-the-return-of-carnage|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic was released as a tie-in to the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time/ |title=Spider-Man: Big Time Begins, 'Spider-Girl,' 'Osborn' and 'Carnage' Comics Announced |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014829/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another five-issue limited series titled ''Carnage U.S.A.'' and published 2011–2012. Carnage was next seen in the 2012 "Minimum Carnage" [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline between [[Scarlet Spider (comic book)#Volume 2|''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2]], [[Venom (comic book)#Venom (2011–present)|''Venom'' vol. 2]], and two [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] titled ''Minimum Carnage Alpha'' and ''Minimum Carnage Omega''. The character crosses over with the [[Superior Spider-Man]] in the 2013 five-issue limited series called ''Superior Carnage'' written by [[Kevin Shinick]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsarama.com/19942-horror-chaos-in-superior-carnage-annual.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was announced that Gerry Conway and Mike Perkins would be launching a new ''Carnage'' series, starting in November 2015, as part of Marvel's post-''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' relaunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conway|first1=Gerry|last2=Mundo|first2=Michael|title=Carnage (2015) #1|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/56601/carnage_2015_1|website=Marvel|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
When [[Eddie Brock]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock's cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]], transforming him into Carnage.&lt;ref name="ASM 344-345"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345&lt;/ref&gt;  The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped prison,&lt;ref name="ASM 359"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359&lt;/ref&gt; and began a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found by [[Spider-Man]] in Kasady's old orphanage, but Spider-Man proved to be no match for Carnage's powers and uncontrollable rage. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.&lt;ref name="ASM 361"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnage symbiote was defeated and apparently destroyed with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but unbeknownst to them the symbiote's deeper equilibrium with its host helped to save it. After entering Kasady's body through a small cut, it bonded to his blood (which caused its red coloration).&lt;ref name="Max Carnage"&gt;'''''Maximum Carnage''''': ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1–2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101–103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378–380; ''Spider-Man'' #35–37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201–203&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Maximum Carnage''===
{{See also|Maximum Carnage}}
Kasady is taken to [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]], a prison for super-villains—then Ravencroft Institute, a facility for the super-human criminally insane. A doctor at the facility, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, draws blood from him—unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage—who goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to take over [[New York City]]. Using Shriek's "psychic channel" powers, he also drives ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" are ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and super-[[antihero]]es, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.&lt;ref name="Max Carnage"/&gt;

===Venom vs. Carnage===
When a videogame is created starring Carnage, the black symbiote breaks out of confinement by somehow going through the computer monitor. After causing havok at Ravencroft he attacks Venom, who manages to defeat him and return him to Ravencroft Institute.&lt;ref name="Venom #1-4"&gt;Venom #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonding with John Jameson===
{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}} 
Though bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.&lt;ref name="Spider-Carnage"/&gt;

===Spider-Carnage===
{{Main|Ben Reilly}} 
It eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man—[[Ben Reilly]] at the time—when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.&lt;ref name="Spider-Carnage"&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #410, ''Spider-Man'' #67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnage Cosmic===
{{Main|Silver Surfer}} 
During a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.&lt;ref name="ASM 430-431"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430–431&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venom Victorious===
Having tracked Kasady to a prison specially designed to hold him, Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good" by eating it.

===Symbiotic Resurrection===
Kasady escaped from prison and was chased by Spider-Man before the two were sucked into the [[Negative Zone]]. Spider-Man teams up with a Negative Zone hero named [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]] while Kasady teamed up with a villain named [[Blaastar]] who was bent on destroying the world. While in the Negative Zone, Kasady found another Symbiote who he bonded with, which allowed the few remains of the Carnage symbiote inside of Cletus to absorb it and resurrect itself in the process to once again become Carnage.&lt;ref name="Web-Spinners 14"&gt;''Web-Spinners'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxin===
{{Main|Toxin (comics)}} 
Eventually, the Carnage symbiote reproduces, with Kasady implanting a spawn of it into Patrick "Paddy" Mulligan, an Irish-American police officer who was recently married and expecting a child. Mulligan became [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]—who single-handedly overpowered both Venom and Carnage. Nevertheless, Mulligan remained determined to use ''his'' new-found powers for good—learning as much as he can from Spider-Man—while leaving behind his wife and newborn son in order to protect them from danger.&lt;ref name="Venom v Carnage 1-4"&gt;''Venom vs. Carnage'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakout===
Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from The Raft.&lt;ref name="The Avengers 1-2"&gt;''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flies Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and rips him in two.

===Family Feud===
It is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth. The [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] return, hoping to repair the symbiote.&lt;ref name= "Carnage"&gt;''Carnage'' #1–5&lt;/ref&gt; Using the properties of the symbiote, Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark, creates prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger. When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.&lt;ref name="Carnage" /&gt; After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.&lt;ref name="Carnage"/&gt; Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then bonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage for Spider-Man and Iron Man. Carnage, however, escapes with the Doppelganger and swears to make a bloody comeback.&lt;ref name="Carnage" /&gt;

===Carnage USA===
In the aftermath of his return, Carnage sets off west to Doverton, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712033608/http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa# |date=2012-07-12 }} #1.&lt;/ref&gt; He bonds most of the town to copies of his symbiote. [[Captain America]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempt to defeat him but all except Spider-Man are bonded to copies. With the Avengers team compromised and Spider-Man out of communication, they send in another team consisted of symbiote-enhanced special forces. Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn goes along with the separated parts of Hybrid which make up Agony, Phage, Riot, and Lasher, but they are heavily outnumbered since Carnage controls the entire town. Captain America breaks free of his hold long enough to make an emergency call for back up to none other than Venom. [[Flash Thompson]] in the Venom symbiote  sets off to Colorado to kill Carnage. The enhanced special forces keep fighting but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, that was when Spider-Man comes with the unaffected residents of the town. The melee is particularly fierce when Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Venom is about to kill Carnage with a gun in the mouth but Spider-Man stops him. Before Venom or Carnage can recover, Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built. She reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there, leaving Kasady alone with a legless Flash Thompson. After the symbiotes fighting with themselves and the Avengers team, Venom finds its way back to Flash Thompson while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote. The series ends with Kasady being captured and dragged into the back of a prison vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''Carnage USA'' #1–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum Carnage===
Carnage escapes prison yet again with the help of microns. Agent Venom is sent to the prison and discovers Kasady has escaped. Carnage flees to Houston, Texas and causes havoc, attracting the attention of the [[Scarlet Spider]]. Carnage takes the scientist Dr. Ketola, an expert in inter-dimensional transportation, as a hostage and escapes into the Microverse.&lt;ref&gt;''Minimum Carnage Alpha''&lt;/ref&gt; He is defeated by Venom and Scarlet Spider, who use a sonic bomb from the Microverse to temporarily separate Kasady from the symbiote. Scarlet Spider then impales Kasady through the eye, lobotomizing him. Carnage goes into a catatonic state: The symbiote is keeping his body alive, similar to a life-support system, but Kasady's brain and mind are believed to be irreparably damaged, leaving the symbiote in control.&lt;ref&gt;''Minimum Carnage Omega''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superior Carnage===
{{Main|Karl Malus}} 
Kasady, now lobotomized, later broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. Carnage breaks free from Wizard's control and nearly kills him, but is subdued by Klaw. Taking Carnage into their hideout, Wizard tries to take control of Kasady's mind, but fails due to it being too damaged. Wizard then transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him "Superior Carnage" and equips him with weapons.&lt;ref name = "SupCar"&gt;''Superior Carnage'' #1–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Malus tells Klaw not to be fooled as while he is forced to obey the Wizard, if his control slips the Symbiote will take control and turn against them. After taking all the weapons and starting to move to the city hall, Wizard blows up the hideout with Kasady still inside, seemingly killing him. While storming the city hall, Superior Carnage states that Kasady was a fool who wasted so much time on chaos while there was much more to be accomplished with a little focus. However, when Wizard's control slips for a moment Carnage begins to revert to his original form until Wizard regains himself.&lt;ref name = "SupCar"/&gt;

The trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard. Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage, followed by Kasady writing "CARNAGE RULES" on his cell wall.&lt;ref name = "SupCar"/&gt;

A piece of the symbiote (which had died in captivity) escapes containment and sets out in search of Kasady, who is bedridden due to having been stabbed by a fellow prison inmate. A doctor, anticipating that the symbiote will come seeking Kasady, smothers the killer in the infirmary, wanting the alien for himself. When the symbiote breaks into the facility, the doctor offers himself to the creature, but it rejects him, and returns to Kasady after resuscitating him. Carnage proceeds to asphyxiate the doctor, rampage through the prison, and escape.&lt;ref name = "SCA"&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[Cullen Bunn]]| penciller = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| inker = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| story = | title = Superior Carnage Annual| volume = 1| issue = #1| date = 5 February 2014| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = United States| page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deadpool vs. Carnage===
Much later, Carnage clashed with [[Deadpool]] believing it was his own destiny to hunt Carnage.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1&lt;/ref&gt; When Carnage tore Deadpool to pieces, Deadpool bonded with the four symbiotes Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #3&lt;/ref&gt; Bonded with the four symbiotes, Deadpool tricked Shriek into thinking she killed Carnage. After that, Deadpool tricked Carnage by forcing Shriek to impersonate Deadpool and Carnage wounded Shriek in the process. Afterwards, Carnage, now broken that he almost killed Shriek, allows himself to be arrested by authorities and placed in an unlocked cell,  Carnage vowed revenge against Deadpool for tricking him.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #4&lt;/ref&gt; After all this is over, Deadpool transfers the four symbiotes over to a dog.

===AXIS===
During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] starts to recruit villains in order to combat the [[Red Skull|Red Onslaught]]. He manages to convince Carnage by saying he'll cause more chaos by becoming a savior and so Carnage agrees. When he sees Deadpool he tells him that they are "going to have words after this".&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battle with Red Onslaught, [[Doctor Doom]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] cast a spell which alters the moralities of almost everyone present, Carnage included. Filled with the irresistible urge to be a hero, Carnage returns to New York and goes around "saving" people, largely oblivious to the fact that he is causing more harm than good.&lt;ref name = "AxisC1"&gt;{{Cite comic

Believing Alice's [[crocodile tears]] and convinced that she is a kindhearted and empathic person, Carnage rescues her from Sin-Eater and abducts her with the intent of having Alice teach him how to be "a great hero".&lt;ref name = "AxisC1"/&gt; However, after Carnage defeats Sin-Eater by overloading his foe with all his old sins, Alice turns on Carnage and convinces the police that he has been attacking her, but the inverted Carnage simply concludes that she is teaching him that a true hero must be alone to protect others and swings away.&lt;ref&gt;''AXIS: Carnage'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the threat of the morally-inverted [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] seeking to enforce their power and the inverted [[X-Men (comics)|X-Men]] working with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to take control of Manhattan, Spider-Man and the aged Steve Rogers are forced to work with Magneto and the "Astonishing Avengers" of Carnage and the other inverted villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Although unable to destroy the X-Men's gene-bomb, which would have killed all humans in the blast radius, Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast with his own symbiote, Spider-Man describing Kasady's sacrifice as the worst man he ever knew doing the most noble thing he'd ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; With the crisis concluded, Peter Parker sets out to create a gold-and-rhinestone memorial to Carnage as he promised Kasady he would before his sacrifice. After the heroes and villains are inverted, a videotape is released in which the Astonishing Avengers—with Carnage as their "spokesman"—proclaim themselves to be the "Axis of Evil", taking responsibility for the Avengers' and the X-Men's actions during the inversion at the cost of their own brief time as heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-AXIS===

However, Kasady was somehow able to cheat death again, though he lost the lower half of his body in the process, and went to Carefree, Arizona, to pay a visit to a new friend he made during the time he was inverted,&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' (vol 5) #24&lt;/ref&gt; a friend he was willing to "help", Sam Alexander aka [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]. Kasady left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander whom he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his more natural moral axis.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' (vol 5) #25&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning that Sam's mother works at a local diner, Kasady took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Kasady decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn't believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Kasady fled in order to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. In the next day, already healed from his burns, Kasady attacked Sam again, this time at his school.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' (vol 5) #26&lt;/ref&gt;

While attacking Sam at school, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's mother wearing his helmet). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try to get Nova's attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Kasady and his symbiote. Kasady was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage's weakness to high sounds, into an [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] (a heavy metal band which Kasady was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Kasady fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker's Island.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' (vol 5) #27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnage Solo series ===
When Cletus escaped as usual, he found out that one woman had survived one of his first slaughters. Enraged, he went after her only to find out that it was a trap orchestrated by FBI agent Claire Dixon, John Jameson as Man-Wolf and Eddie Brock as Toxin. They started to battle, but the mine they were in started to crumble. He suddenly met a cultist who worships [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] and told him that he is part of the [[Darkhold]] prophesy and spilled his blood on the book giving Carnage new supernatural powers. &lt;ref&gt;''Carnage The One Who Got Away.'' Vol. 1 Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After that, Carnage hijacked a boat in order to resurrect Chthon and be rewarded. When Claire's team got to the boat, she was abducted by Carnage and he bonded her to his third offspring, Raze. Next, the team tried to kill Carnage by exploding the boat. Cletus was rescued by a young girl named Jubil, not knowing who he was. He tried to infect her with his symbiote, but she proved to be immune to him. She exploded her boat in an effort to get rid of Carnage.&lt;ref&gt;''Carnage World Tour'' Vol. 2 Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnage survived and went to the island where he could resurrect Chthon. The team, along with Jubil, went to the island and found countless dead bodies. Carnage finally resurrects Chthon, only to pushed aside by him. Since Jubil had a piece of the power from Carnage, Eddie Brock gave his Toxin symbiote to her and she with the symbiote took the form of an Angelic Knight and defeated Chthon, resulting in the apparent death of Toxin. Carnage now furious, tried to kill the team, until Claire (who got rid of her symbiote) sacrificed herself to save the others. Then the team used the Darkhold against Carnage by separating the symbiote from Cletus. &lt;ref&gt;''Carnage What Dwells Beneath'' Vol 3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Goblin===
{{Main|Norman Osborn|Normie Osborn}}
Following [[Secret Empire (comics)|Hydra's coup of America]], the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].&lt;ref name="ASM 794"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #794&lt;/ref&gt; He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #795&lt;/ref&gt; but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #796&lt;/ref&gt; Using this combination of powers during the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #799&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main article|Symbiote (comics)}}
As Eddie Brock explained,&lt;ref name="ASM 362" &gt;The Amazing Spider-Man #362&lt;/ref&gt; the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor—due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it—[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined&lt;ref name="ASM 362" /&gt; and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].&lt;ref name="Carnage: Mind Bomb"&gt;''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.&lt;ref name="ASM 361" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SMU 2"&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''&lt;/ref&gt; He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to that of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.

He is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from decapitation.&lt;ref name="Venom Vol 2 #27"&gt;''Venom Vol 2 #27''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AXIS: Carnage #3"&gt;''AXIS:Carnage #3''&lt;/ref&gt; However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.&lt;ref name="Carnage"/&gt; Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),&lt;ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004"&gt;''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is undetectable to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.&lt;ref name="ASM 361" /&gt; Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.

Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as "camouflage". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can "regenerate" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.&lt;ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004" /&gt; The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,&lt;ref name="New Avengers 1-2"&gt;''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1–2&lt;/ref&gt; the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.&lt;ref name="Carnage" /&gt;

In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.&lt;ref name="New Avengers 1-2" /&gt;  The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.&lt;ref name="Carnage" /&gt;

Finally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.&lt;ref name="SM 36"&gt;''Spider-Man'' #36&lt;/ref&gt; Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.&lt;ref name="ASM 361-363"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361–363&lt;/ref&gt; He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,&lt;ref name="ASM 430-431" /&gt; likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase "Carnage Rules" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.&lt;ref name="ASM 361-363" /&gt; On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.&lt;ref name="ASM 430"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430&lt;/ref&gt; Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.&lt;ref name="SM 36" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SM &amp; B 1"&gt;''Spider-Man and Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom's touch was still dangerous.

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "'''Spider'''", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.&lt;ref name="Exiles 13"&gt;''Exiles'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend, [[Moose Mansfied]].&lt;ref name="ASG 9"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9–12&lt;/ref&gt; He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.

In a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create "Biopreds", living weapons that the government use to try to stop '''Mayhem''', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.&lt;ref name="SG: The End"&gt;''Spider-Girl: The End''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|symbiotic suit research]]. When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.&lt;ref name="USM 128"&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USM Images"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull |title=Video Games, Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News &amp; Videos – IGN |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension hopping Web-Warriors who aides dimensions who lost its Spider-Man defeated Sinister Sextet and as they round up their captives they notice that Electro escaped, unbeknown to the group, followed them to the Great Web.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venomverse===
When Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side. They summoned a Carnage that hailed from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, and while he was volatile at first, engaging in battle with the Resistance, when he realized he had the opportunity to fight "a buncha messed-up super-heroes" he decided to join the Venoms.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomverse'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, Carnage was immune to the Poisons, and he helped tip the scales in their favor as one last ditch suicide run and was left for dead alongside Poison Deadpool, and was seemingly killed when the Hive's ship was destroyed, after the heroes were sent back to their respective dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''Venomverse'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercompany crossover===

====Amalgam Comics====
Carnage was also used in DC and Marvel's [[Amalgam Comics]], where he was amalgamated with [[Bizarro]] into ''Bizarnage'', an adversary of Spider-Boy who appeared in his only issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Boy'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.comicvine.com/bizarnage/4005-50812/issues-cover/ |title = Bizarnage |publisher = Comic Vine |website = Comic Vine |accessdate= 13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his self-titled episode "Carnage", the original form is created when the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] injects Peter Parker with a symbiote sample to be a perfect Venom but Peter's spider cells makes the organism unstable and imperfect. With Peter as his host, Carnage is sent by the Goblin to eliminate Spider-Man; the Goblin, while approving of this new 'son', didn't know Spider-Man and Peter are the same individual. Carnage attacks [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D.

This version is created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] from a symbiote sample forcibly taken from Agent Venom. After being injected with Doctor Octopus's vampire bat DNA serum, Morbius retaliates by throwing the new symbiote on Doc Ock. Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]] then fight '''[[Doctor Octopus|Carnage-Ock]]''' until Spider-Man uses a sound device, resulting in separation which also neutralized its host's nanites. Carnage then turns into his familiar form with a red-and-black hybrid look with black teeth, speaking and acting on its own, no longer needing a host to cause chaos. Carnage fights with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom, tricking the two young heroes into exploding himself so that the civilians below can become infected by the symbiote's fragments. The fragmented symbiote possess every civilian in Manhattan (including [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]). Spider-Man works with [[Captain America]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to fight '''[[Hulk (comics)|Carnage-Hulk]]''' and various other hosts as the Carnage-possessed civilians causes [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]'s reawakening from [[Oscorp]]. While [[Mary Jane Watson]] (via Midtown High) uses [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]]' network to help innocent civilians, Spider-Man manages to gets Anti-Venom atop Carnage's 'heart' where Harry sacrifices the Anti-Venom symbiote to undo Carnage's control over everyone. However, Carnage reassembles into a giant creature that Spider-Man and Agent Venom fight, resulting in the creature enveloping Midtown High. Now a hive in Midtown High, Carnage's forms (miniature versions, Spider-like creatures and wasps-like creatures) are fought by Spider-Man, Agent Venom and the Patrioteer fight before having a deadly encounter with the '''[[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=15|airdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Morbius and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] plan to use deactivated HYDRA missiles confiscated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] below Midtown High to send symbiote drones to every city in the world. After Crossbones's escape and Morbius's defeat, Mary Jane overcomes Carnage's control and Flash deactivates the symbiote missiles. "The Spider-Slayers" revealed Mary Jane embraces the Carnage symbiote within and assumes the Spider-Woman identity (referenced as Spider-MJ) thanks to Dr. Connors's experiment which help control the organism completely.

S.H.I.E.L.D. began experimenting on Carnage and the fragment, combining them in hopes of creating a new kind of energy. Carnage absorbs the fragment and escapes containment, draining everyone coming across of energy and using the power of the tablet to reanimate them as mindless zombies (which slowly mutate into symbiote creatures like himself). Spider-Man pursues Carnage throughout the burning ruins of the Triskelion, dealing with the villain's spawn and [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers (which identify Spider-Man as a threat due to his use of the symbiote-based Black Suit). Cornering his target on the highest floor of the Triskelion and gaining the assistance of some reprogrammed Spider-Slayers, Spider-Man defeats Carnage and retrieves the final fragment, leaving the creature pinned under rubble.

===Attractions===
During the 2002 [[Halloween Horror Nights]], [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] featured a haunted maze entitled "Maximum Carnage". The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the bloody remains of various Marvel superheroes. The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scarezone "Island Under Siege". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the "island", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The event's main icon, "The Caretaker", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.&lt;ref name="Horror Nights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Open The Vault"&gt;[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.

'''Charles Norris''' (December 4, 1867 - September 11, 1935) was [[New York City|New York]]'s first appointed [[Chief Medical Examiner|chief medical examiner]] (1918–1935) and pioneer of [[forensic toxicology]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3324752 | volume=8 | title=Charles Norris (1868-1935) and Thomas A. Gonzales (1878-1956), New York's forensic pioneers | journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol | pages=350–3 | last1 = Eckert | first1 = WG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Norris was born on December 4, 1867.  He was first educated at Cutler's Private School in Manhattan, later entering Yale University and earning a bachelor of philosophy with emphasis on science.  He then went to the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], earning a doctorate in medicine in 1892.  After studying for four years in Europe, he returned to New York, and in 1904 became the laboratory director at Bellevue and Allied Hospitals.&lt;ref name=blum&gt;[[Deborah Blum]]. ''The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York.'' New York: Penguin, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical examiner==
In 1917, Norris, applying for the job of [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York]], took a civil service examination and passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Norris Succeeds Riordan |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/02/01/102663632.pdf |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=February 1, 1918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor [[John F. Hylan]] immediately took legal action against him, claiming that in performing autopsies as part of the examination he had violated the law.  Fortunately for Norris, the state government took notice and intervened, forcing Hylan to appoint Norris chief medical examiner.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

Norris immediately set about improving his department.  After hiring several distinguished scientists and chemists, including [[Alexander Gettler]], he was forced, due to the lack of any supplies, to buy them all out of his own money.  Other problems included the possibility of his workers being drafted to serve in the army (which he solved by writing to Hylan), and the low salaries of his workers, which averaged less than $4,000 a year (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1918|r=-3}}}} today).&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

===Tetraethyl lead and the "looney gas building"===

In 1924, Norris was called in to investigate the mysterious insanity and deaths of workers in a plant that made [[tetraethyllead]].  It was mostly made in [[Standard Oil]]'s plant at the [[Bayway Refinery]] in New Jersey. TEL was compounded in a small red brick building which was soon nicknamed the "looney gas building", due to the insanity of the workers there.  Although Standard Oil had tried to deny that the deaths were due to tetraethyllead, New Jersey ordered the plant shut down.  Although a federal investigation, by chemical industry scientists, responded to the concerns by recommending certain safety measures be adopted by production workers, it concluded that the risk posed to the public was low and the plant resumed production soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;  It was not until 1978 that the leaded gasoline was banned.

===Carbon monoxide poisoning===

In December 1926, Francesco Travia was caught carrying parts of Anna Fredericksen's body towards the Brooklyn waterfront in New York city. Detectives found the remains of Fredericksen's dismembered body in Travia's apartment and charged him with murder. Travia claimed he and the victim had fallen asleep after drinking whiskey in his apartment, and that after waking up he found her dead on the floor.  Dr. Norris concluded that the victim had died of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning and could not have been killed by Travia.  The police department ignored the conclusions of Norris and charged Travia with murder.  At Travia's trial in March, 1927, the forensic analysis of Norris and chemist [[Alexander Gettler]] proved carbon monoxide gas from Travia's stove had poisoned her to death.  Travia was acquitted of murder, convicted instead of illegally dismembering a dead body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/sep/23/forensic-science-murder "Forensic science was not always CSI-style teamwork"] The Guardian, Deborah Blum, 23 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory Board of the Association Against Impure Liquor===
On February 12, 1927, Norris was elected to the chairmanship of the Advisory Board of the Association Against Impure Liquor.  The purpose of the
organization was to organize physicians, hospital administrators, and pharmacists who "realize the necessity of purity of liquors
administered to the sick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Norris Heads Fight On Impure Liquor.

==Death==
In the spring of 1935, Norris began to feel ill.  He began staying away from public events.  That summer, he took a vacation to [[South America]], hoping to improve his health.  Once he returned in late August, his health steadily deteriorated.  He died at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September 11, 1935, of [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

'''Chet Bitterman''' (c. 1953&amp;ndash;1981) also known as Chester Bitterman Jr, named after his father, was an American [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Christian missionary]] who was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and killed by revolutionaries of the [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19) in Colombia in 1981.

Originally from [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], Bitterman attended [[Columbia Bible College]] in South Carolina, where he first heard of the Christian mission organization [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]].  After graduation, he received linguistics training from the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (SIL) in North Dakota, and married Brenda Gardner, a fellow alumna of SIL's training program.  Together, they traveled to Colombia to begin mission work with Wycliffe in 1979.

As an inexperienced missionary, Bitterman was not immediately assigned to a tribal group where he could begin to translate the Bible into a new language as many Wycliffe missionaries do.  Instead, he worked primarily at Wycliffe's base in Lomalinda, first working in the radio tower and later serving as security coordinator.  Their time at Lomalinda was broken up by a six-month service trip in [[Bogotá]] where Bitterman and his wife assisted a more experienced translator couple.  However, by 1981, plans began to fall into place for Bitterman and his wife to attempt to reach the [[Carijona]] tribe in the Colombian jungle.

== Abduction and execution ==
At 6:30 a.m. on January 19, 1981, seven [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrillas entered SIL's housing facility in Bogotá, where the Bittermans were staying at the time. Not finding Al Wheeler—whom they believed to be the director of SIL's Colombia Branch—they kidnapped Bitterman instead.  Several days later, the guerillas demanded that SIL leave the country.  Finally, 48 days after his abduction, on March 7, 1981, Bitterman's body was found in a bus near Bogotá, having been shot in the chest.

There was found an entry in Chet's journal written nearly two years before his death that read. "The situation in Nicaragua is getting worse. If Nicaragua falls, I guess the rest of Central America will too. Maybe this is just some kind of self-inflicted Martyr complex, but I find this recurring thought that perhaps God will call me to be martyred in His service in Colombia. I am willing."{{full  citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Cincinnati''' (ca. 1860&amp;ndash;1878) was General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s most famous horse during the [[American Civil War]]. He was the son of [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]], the fastest four-mile [[Thoroughbred]] in the United States (time 7:19.75 minutes) and one of the greatest sires. Cincinnati was also the grandson of the great [[Boston (horse)|Boston]], who sired Lexington.

[[File:Grant's horses.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of three of Grant's horses during the [[Overland Campaign]] (Cold Harbor, Virginia), from left to right: Egypt, Cincinnati, and Jeff Davis]]
At an early age, Grant emotionally bonded to horses. A shy, quiet child, he found joy in working with and riding them. Grant excelled in horsemanship at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], and at graduation, he put on an outstanding jumping display. Grant owned many horses in his lifetime, including one named '''Jeff Davis''', so named because he acquired it during his [[Vicksburg Campaign]] from [[Jefferson Davis]]'s [[Mississippi]] plantation.

Cincinnati was a gift from an admirer during the War. The horse was large ({{hands|17}}), handsome, and powerful, and he quickly became Grant's favorite. When Grant rode Cincinnati to negotiate [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], the animal became immortalized. Virtually all depictions of Grant in drawings, granite, and bronze, are astride Cincinnati including at the [[Ulysses S. Grant Memorial]], located on the Mall in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the base of [[Capitol Hill]].

Cincinnati died in [[Maryland]] on the farm of Admiral [[Daniel Ammen]].

'''Cognitive social structures''' ('''CSS''') is the focus of research that investigates how individuals perceive their own [[social structure]] (e.g. members of an organization, friend group, hierarchy, company employees, etc.). It is part of [[social network]] research and uses [[social network analysis]] to understand how various factors affect one’s cognitive representation of the network (i.e. the individual’s belief of who is connected to whom).  Importantly, an individual’s perception of the network may be different than reality. In fact, these differences between the perceived network and the actual network are the focus of many studies that seek insight into how we think about others and our relationships.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brands"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Krackhardt]] discussed the study of cognitive social structures in an article that defined the term and outlined its uses in social network research. [[Social structures]] are defined by a set of individual members and the relations between those members. The study of cognitive social structures also includes every member’s understanding of the social structure. Thus, a cognitive social structure consisting of ''n'' people has ''n'' separate, and possibly distinct, representations of that social structure.

Example: ''Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all friends. Thus, there are three separate representations of their network. If they each believe they are friends with the other two, but that the other two are not friends, then all three representations are distinct. That is, none of them agree on the structure of their friendship network.  If, on the other hand, they all believed they were all friends, then they would all have the same representation of the network.''

Furthermore, the perceived structure of the network and the actual structure of the network may be inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brands"/&gt; By measuring every member’s perception of the network, researchers can analyze the systematic errors to understand how we think about networks and what affects these perceptions.

A network may consist of directed relations. A directed relation involves a sender and a receiver. For example, the relation “goes to for advice” is directed in that if Alice (sender) goes to Bob (receiver) for advice, it does not mean that Bob also goes to Alice for advice. The relation, "is a sibling of", on the other hand, is [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]], not directed, because if Alice is a sibling of Bob, then Bob is necessarily a sibling of Alice.

=== Terminology ===
* '''[[Broker]]''': A member who connects those who would otherwise be unconnected.
* '''[[Centrality]]''': Influence measured by number of connections and distance from others with high centrality
** '''[[Eigenvector centrality]]''': How well connected an individual is to other well-connected members
* '''[[Triadic closure|Closure]]/[[balance theory|Balance]]''': Given a member who is directly connected to two others, the triad is balanced if the other two are also connected
::''Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie. The triad is said to be balanced if Bob and Charlie are also friends. It is unbalanced if Bob and Charlie are not friends.''

* '''[[degree (graph theory)|Degree]]''': The number of direct connections
** '''In-degree''': The number of ties directed towards the person
** '''Out-degree''': The number of directed ties from the person to others
::''Alice goes to Bob and Charlie for advice. Bob goes to Alice for advice. Alice has in-degree 1, and out-degree 2.''

* '''[[distance (graph theory)|Geodesic Distance]]''': The shortest path between two individuals
::''Alice is friends with Bob who is friends with Charlie who is friends with David. The geodesic distance between Alice and Bob is one, between Alice and Charlie is two, and between Alice and David is three.''

* '''[[Homophily]]''': How similar an individual is to those directly connected to them
* '''[[Reciprocity (network science)|Reciprocity]]/Mutuality''': Given a directed relation from person A to person B, whether or not there is also a directed relation from person B to person A.
::''Alice goes to Bob for advice. This relationship is reciprocal if Bob also goes to Alice for advice.''

== Analyzing Cognitive Social Structures ==

=== Ego Network Analysis ===
An ego network, or a local structure, consists of the individual and every member who is directly connected to that individual. For example, on [[social media]], a user's ego network consists of the user (ego), everyone who is directly linked to that user's account (e.g. "friends" or "followers"), and the connections between those people (e.g. whether or not they are "friends" with or "followers" of each other). In an experiment, an ego network is measured by asking the participant to list everybody to whom they are directly connected, and then note which of those people are connected to each other. Thus, in an experimental setting, the ego network reflects the participant's view of their local network, and therefore may differ from another's participant's perspective.

=== Full Network Analysis ===
There are three primary methods used to examine a full cognitive social structure: slices (the individual perceptions of the full network), locally aggregated structures (the combination of each member’s direct connections), and consensus structures (the network of relations that more than a certain portion of members agree on).&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt;

==== Slices&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
One way to analyze a cognitive social structure is to individually look at each “slice”, that is, each member’s perception. Biases in network perception may shift based on the individual (e.g. personality) or the position (e.g. popular, low status). Comparing slices reveals differences between individuals as well as systematic errors in perception across members.

==== Locally Aggregated Structures (LAS)&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
One approach to studying a cognitive social structure is to measure each member’s direct connections (ego networks). In other words, ask each individual to report who they are related to (e.g. friends with) in the network. That is, consider the individual’s own relationships. Then connect all of these local networks to form the whole network. Building a network model in this way can be achieved by asking individuals who they relate to (e.g. “Who do you go to for advice?”), known as a Row Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure, or who is related to them (e.g. “Who goes to you for advice?”), known as a Column Dominated Locally Aggregated Structure.

There are two ways to combine local structures into the full locally aggregated structure. Taking the intersection of the local networks results in a network in which relations exist if both members perceive it. In a friendship network, this means that a friendship only exists if both people consider the other a friend. The union of the local networks is a structure consisting of relations that at least one involved member perceives. In a friendship network, this is equivalent to saying a friendship exists between two people if at least one of them considers the other a friend.

==== Consensus Structures&lt;ref name="Krackhardt"/&gt; ====
The consensus structure of a cognitive social structure is the network that more than a certain number of people perceive. This is accomplished by fixing a threshold such that a relation is said to exist if and only if the proportion of members who perceive that relation is greater than the threshold. For example, setting the threshold to 0.5 means that the relation between two people exists if the majority of people believe it exists. Similarly, a relation between two people does not exist if a majority of people do not perceive it.

== Empirical Findings ==
Many species are able to represent social structures, yet humans are able to represent disproportionately large social structures (based on cortical thickness in the brain).&lt;ref name="Brashears"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/srep01513
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research suggests that this is, at least in part, due to the use of [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s.&lt;ref name="Krackhardt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilduff"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Schemas are a pre-established method of organizing and perceiving the world. Similar to a template, schemas provide a basic scaffolding that allow humans to make assumptions about a social structure without remembering every detail individually. This preserves neural resources, allowing for representation of larger structures.&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Some research suggests that a basic schema people utilize is based on [[small-world network]] properties.&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Namely, one tends to believe that their social network contains groups of people who are highly intraconnected, and that these groups, or clusters, are connected via short paths.&lt;ref name="Kilduff"/&gt; Other work suggests that this is particularly true of one's own group, but not for others.&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt; For example, Alice likely believes that all of her friends are friends with each other, but other groups are not as connected.

In addition to making network representation efficient, schemas, as well as other biases, lead to systematic errors in network perception. These errors in individual and group perceptions has been the focus of much of the research related to cognitive social structures.

In research, a typical method of measuring cognitive social structures involves 
:(a) listing one’s direct ties, either in general or in terms of whom they’ve interacted with recently, or 
:(b) completing a table that lists all members in the rows and columns by checking off whom everyone is connected to.

=== Learning Networks ===

Specific factors have been shown to influence how easily and how well people are able to learn new networks.&lt;ref name="Karuza"&gt;{{cite journal

|pages=629–640
|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2016.06.003
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed above, people use schemas to represent networks. It makes sense, therefore, that structures that are consistent with these schemas are easier to learn.&lt;ref name="Janicik"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, behavioral research suggests that individuals are better at learning networks that group members by positive relations (e.g. "liking") and divide groups by negative relations (e.g. "disliking"),&lt;ref name="DeSoto1968"&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=4
|pages=303–307
|doi=10.1037/h0044867
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and larger networks are easier to remember if they are balanced (if one person is friends with two others, than those two are also friends).&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt; People are also better at remembering large networks if they include kin labels (e.g. "Mother", "Uncle", "Cousin", etc.) than if they do not.&lt;ref name="Brashears"/&gt;

=== Accuracy ===
Many researchers compare individuals’ cognitive social structures to the actual social structure in order to measure consistent errors, or biases, involved with cognitive social structures. While some research shows that individuals’ representations correlate with the aggregate group’s representation,&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Kumbasar|first1=Ece

|journal=American Journal of Sociology
|volume=100
|issue=2
|pages=477–505
|doi=10.1086/230544
}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are systematic errors that occur as a result of network position and individual differences.&lt;ref name="Brands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt;

Many researchers have studied the effects of and the perceptions of centrality , or how well connected one is within the network. Broadly, individuals tend to believe they have higher centrality (i.e. better connected within the network) and higher degree (e.g. more friends) than others believe.&lt;ref name="Kumbasar"/&gt; Furthermore, members who have low centrality, such as those who are on the periphery of the network or at the bottom of the hierarchy (unpopular, low status), tend to have more accurate representations than those who are more central (popular, high status).&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies suggest that social network representations track overall patterns of behavior, rather than specific events.&lt;ref name="Killworth"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Killwroth|first1=Peter
|last2=Bernard|first2=H.
|title=Informant accuracy in social network data

|pages=269–286
|doi=10.17730/humo.35.3.10215j2m359266n2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there appears to be a trade-off between overall accuracy and specific event accuracy: those who remember details of a specific interaction tend to have less accurate representations of overall behavior patterns, while those with more accurate pattern representations have more trouble recalling event details.&lt;ref name="FreemanEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Freeman|first1=Linton C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This can cause issues when studying cognitive social structures because, often, the only way to determine the true social network is by observing behavior. If, however, the researchers do not sufficiently observe the network, then the observed behavior may not be representative of the overall patterns of behavior. Some research suggests that people extract these patterns of behavior by tracking the frequency of interactions, assuming that the more frequently two people interact, the more likely they are connected.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt; This leads to the belief that people are more connected than they actually are.&lt;ref name="FreemanWebster"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Individual Differences ===
Studies on [[individual differences]] in cognitive social structures examine how individuals' traits affect their perceptions of social networks. Following are specific aspects of individuals that researchers have found influence cognitive social structures.

'''[[Need for closure]]''',&lt;ref name="NFC"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to one's tendency to avoid ambiguity, has been shown to correlate with the number of ties that are perceived as transitive.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"&gt;

|doi=10.1037/a0020961
}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the higher one's need for closure, the more likely they are to perceive unbalanced groups as balanced. Additionally, people with high need for closure tend to cluster people by racial similarity in their representation of social networks.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"/&gt;

'''Status, Power, Popularity''': in real-world social networks, low-power members tend to have more accurate perceptions of social networks than high-power individuals, particularly regarding people who are distant to the perceiver.&lt;ref name="SimpsonBorch"/&gt; One study found that these low-power individuals with accurate network perceptions received more payoffs compared to other low-power members with less accurate perceptions.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011a"&gt;

|pages=172–176
|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2010.10.008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the benefits to low-status individuals with accurate network knowledge only held if other low-status people had worse knowledge.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011a"/&gt; Similarly, in a controlled setting, participants [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] with low-status then had more accurate representations of a social network, but not of a non-social network.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b"/&gt; This research suggests that one's own status is an important factor in their representation of their social networks, because high power prompts people to use [[heuristics]], while low-power people use more systematic methods to understand the network.&lt;ref name="Simpson2011b" /&gt;

There has been lots of research on how people perceive their social network and the differences between these perceptions. Other individual differences measures have been suggested to influence cognitive social structures, including [[need for achievement]], [[need for affiliation]], and [[self-monitoring]].&lt;ref name="Casciaro"&gt;

However, since studies often use different types of networks (e.g. real-world organizations, friend groups, communication networks), there is not yet consensus on the effect of these differences.

'''Cylons''' are a fictional artificially-intelligent "species" envisioned in the ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[science fiction]] series and related franchises. Originally created to serve human needs like other machines, a series of events involving the transfer of a human's consciousness into a Cylon's neural network led Cylons to evolve into sentient, self-aware beings. The original Cylons were purely mechanical.

The Cylon was reimagined in the second ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series and its prequel ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]].'' The first configurations (Centurions) were robots. Others were [[cyborgs]] whose different configurations incorporated biological elements, including some that were nearly indistinguishable from humans.
{{toclimit|3}}

== Background ==
One of the series’ core themes is [[historic recurrence|‘All of this has happened before and will happen again’]].&lt;ref name="recurrence"&gt;https://cityoftongues.com/non-fiction/all-of-this-has-happened-before/&lt;/ref&gt; Cylon Centurions were invented twice: Once thousands of years before the events of [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] and later they fought a war against the Thirteenth Tribe on Earth.&lt;ref name="No Exit"&gt;[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Centurion creation is detailed in the prequel series ''Caprica''. There they were created by [[Zoe Graystone]] and her father [[Daniel Graystone]], owner of Graystone Industries.&lt;ref&gt;''Caprica'' pilot&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Caprica'' ==
=== Centurions ===
The ''Caprica'' Cylon is a combination of programming done by Zoe and Daniel's MCP-enhanced ("Meta-Cognitive Processor") Graystone Industries U-87 Robot. A common activity on Caprica was to participate in a virtual world (V-World) that allowed players to live an alternate existence. The original Cylon was developed as a place to house Zoe's [[avatar]] (virtual existence) after she is killed in a bombing on a [[maglev]] train in ''Caprica'' Episode 1. Her father sees her avatar in V-World and forces her best friend Lacy to take him to her there where she explains that she is much more than a simple digital simulation. She has Zoe's memories from a neural scan Zoe developed to extend a V-World character into a virtual instance of the person. The digital Zoe says to her father, "I don't feel like a copy", and she becomes the basis of the first Cylons.

Cylons were originally accepted into Caprican culture as robotic workers after a group of them (under direct remote control by Graystone himself, with the help of his wife Amanda) successfully thwarted an attack on the public at Atlas Stadium by the Soldiers of the One (STO). The Cylons then spread throughout the colonies as a worker class, but because they had basic self-awareness they became increasingly resentful of their servitude.

== ''Battlestar Galactica'' ==
In ''Battlestar Galactica'', the Cylons were created thousands of years before the series began. They destroyed the Thirteenth Tribe living on the original Earth 2,000 years before.

''BSGr'' Cylon society consists of three classes: biological ruling-class [[Android (robot)|androids]] (pejoratively "skinjobs"), labor-warrior class (Centurions), and a transport-air warrior class ([[Cylon Basestar#Battlestar Galactica (2004–2009)|Basestars]] and [[Cylon Raider|Raiders]]). Basestars and Raiders are partly biological [[cyborgs]] and as such are vulnerable to biological threats such as disease.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite episode --&gt; Season three&lt;/ref&gt; Raiders and Centurions, while intelligent, were inhibited from exercising free will, although the Hybrids that controlled Basestars did exercise some autonomy and were respected by the skinjobs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite episode --&gt; Season four&lt;/ref&gt;

The skinjobs lead Cylon society. Some are [[sleeper agent]]s, programmed with false memories to think they are human. Cylons can convincingly interact with humans and are capable of intimate relationships.

They have limited [[superhuman]] abilities such as increased stamina and strength and the ability to connect with computer systems. Cylons are more sensitive than humans to some forms of radiation and more resistant than humans to others. They can upload their memories to other copies of their model through a central station. Another Cylon, of the same model, can then access these memories. The humanoid Cylons have the ability to distinguish between copies by sight, unlike Centurions and humans.

=== Toasters ===
Centurions are often called [[toaster]]s by humans, partly a reference to their metallic construction but also to demean them. "Toaster" was also used to derogate skinjob, another derogatory term (and an homage to the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' in which ''BSGr'' star [[Edward James Olmos]] has a supporting role). Centurions were also termed "chromejobs" or "bulletheads". The (chronological) origin of the word "toaster" can be found in the prequel [[Caprica]], episode 10 which was created after BSG had ended. After a car crash made the first-ever test Cylon inoperable, it was considered "toast" after which [[List of Caprica characters#Tomas Vergis|Tomas Vergis]] joked "or a toaster". The term "skinjob" is originally used in Caprica, episode 17, where a new body is being discussed for an avatar (and AI) of "Zoe". The parents emphasize it will be "with skin" (as opposed to the Cylon, metal prototypes) which she then calls "a skinjob".

=== Reproduction ===
Cylons were initially unable to produce children with each other. They turned their attention to mating with humans. Their crossbreeding experiments in facilities called "farms" are unsuccessful. They theorize that love is necessary for them to procreate, because "God is love" in their theology. This leads to a successful experiment in which an Eight and a human, Karl Agathon, fall in love and produce a daughter named Hera.

Skinjobs can [[download]] their consciousness into another body when the body they are using dies, giving them virtual immortality. These downloads have a limited range, requiring the Cylons to build a "Resurrection Ship" to capture them. If not within range of a Resurrection Ship, downloading is unavailable and a Cylon's death is permanent. The downloading process is shared by the semi-organic Raider spacecraft, which allows Raiders who have been killed several times to become more formidable fighters ("[[Scar (Battlestar Galactica)|Scar]]"). The Centurions do not download. Resurrection Ships function as boosters for the central Resurrection Hub. Without the Hub resurrection is not possible.

This technology was first shown in Caprica in an attempt to "resurrect" deceased relatives in a so-called "resurrection" program (first called that way in episode 13) in [[virtual reality]] where one could meet and interact with those one was mourning for.

=== Projection ===
Cylons have an ability referred to as "projection", a form of realistic daydreaming that allows them to change the appearance of their surroundings in their own mind (e.g. making the corridors of a ship look like a forest, etc.). They have the ability to touch, smell, etc. the fantasy environment. They can share projections and create virtual individuals as part of the fantasy. This ability allows them to express their subconscious desires.&lt;ref name="ct090228"&gt;{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-starbuck-boomer-someone-to-watch-over-me-.html | title = Play it again, Starbuck: Talking to Weddle and Thompson about 'Someone to Watch Over Me' | date = 2009-02-28 | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate = 2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boxing ===
If a Cylon is deemed dangerous by the other models, he or she may be "boxed" – deactivated with consciousness and memories placed in storage. This may involve a particular copy or an entire line. Boxed consciousnesses are stored in the Resurrection Hub and can be unboxed.  The term was also used in the prequel [[Caprica]] episode 10 which discusses "boxing" a defunct test cylon (as literally placing it in a crate for "deep storage"). As Caprica is the prequel this is chronologically the first time of its use from which the Cylons derived their own definition.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}

=== Thirteenth Tribe ===
Between 3–4,000 years before the Second Cylon War, it is implied that the humans and Cylons of Kobol fought each other, but the nature of the conflict remains unrevealed. The Thirteenth Tribe were Cylons who fled Kobol and settled on a planet they dubbed Earth. Eventually, they developed the ability to reproduce sexually. Resurrection technology fell into disuse and was lost. The Final Five redeveloped resurrection, following warnings by mysterious "angels" that a Kobol-like disaster was coming. When life on Cylon Earth was destroyed in a nuclear war between the thirteenth tribe and their mechanical Cylon creations (stemming from the latter's maltreatment at the hands of the Tribe), the Final Five downloaded into an orbiting vessel.&lt;ref name="No Exit"/&gt;

The Final Five wanted to warn the other Twelve Colonies to treat their Cylon workers well to prevent another catastrophe. However, without faster than light (FTL) travel, they required approximately 2,000 years to make the journey (relative to human time, while only a few years passed inside the ship due to [[Special Relativity]]). When they arrived, the Twelve Colonies' Cylon Centurions had revolted and the first [[Cylon War]] was raging. It lasted roughly twelve and a half years.&lt;ref name="No Exit"/&gt;

The Final Five learned that these Centurions were trying to develop organic bodies through experiments on humans, resulting in the first Hybrid. To end the war, the Final Five helped the Centurions develop skinjob model numbers One to Eight (model number Seven's creation was sabotaged by One) and resurrection technology. The war ended with an [[armistice]] and an attempt by the Colonies to establish diplomatic relations between the parties. Instead, the Cylons disappeared for forty years.&lt;ref name="No Exit"/&gt;

The first of the Colonial skinjobs, One John Cavil, refused to let the Final Five's concern for humanity blind them. He boxed the Final Five. He then periodically sent them to the Colonies to see how terrible humanity was.&lt;ref name="No Exit"/&gt;

=== Second Cylon War ===
After forty years, the Colonial Admiralty sent Battlestar ''[[Battlestar Valkyrie|Valkyrie]]'' on a covert mission close to the armistice line to gather intelligence on Cylon activity. A stealth ship from the ''Valkyrie'' crossed the armistice line, but was intercepted by the Cylons. Three years later the Cylons initiated a surprise attack on the Colonies. The attack was successful because a Cylon agent, later known as [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]], infiltrated [[List of Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]]'s colonial defense network with the unwitting complicity of renowned scientist [[Gaius Baltar]] and created backdoor programs to shut down the network and its defenses. The attacks wiped out billions of humans, nearly the entire colonial population. Two Battlestars – ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Pegasus|Pegasus]]'' – survived. A [[List of miscellaneous ships in Battlestar Galactica (2004)|fleet of civilian ships]] was scattered throughout the neighboring space. Together they fled into deep space.

The Cylons pursued them while initiating the next phase of their evolution, [[procreation]]. Female human survivors were detained and used in experiments to create Cylon-human hybrids. The experiments were unsuccessful leading the Cylons to conclude that the missing component was love. They tested this by using an [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eight]] posing as Lt. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii from ''Galactica'' to seduce a marooned Galactica officer, [[Karl Agathon|Lt. Karl "Helo" Agathon]] on Caprica. They fell in love. The Eight abandoned the Cylons, helping Helo to escape. The couple later produced the first viable human/Cylon birth. This Eight joined the fleet with Helo. She later married Helo, joined the Colonial military and received the call sign "Athena".

Ten months after the initial attacks, Eight Sharon Valerii (call sign "Boomer"), attempted to assassinate Commander Adama under the influence of unexplained programing unknown to her. She was unaware that she was a Cylon before the attack, though she had been uneasy because of unexplained blackouts (during various attempts to sabotage ''Galactica''). A vengeful crew mate, [[Cally Henderson Tyrol|Cally Henderson]] killed her. She downloaded into a new body and settled on Cylon-occupied Caprica in her former apartment, unable to relinquish her human identity. She led a campaign for better treatment of the humans. She and other like-minded Cylons influenced the Cylon civilization, which withdrew from the colonial home worlds and pursued benevolent treatment of the humans and then reconciliation.

During this time, the half-human half-Cylon hybrid, [[Hera Agathon]] was born on ''Galactica.'' Fearing that the Cylons might capture the child, [[Laura Roslin|President Laura Roslin]] faked Hera's death and secretly had her adopted by a human woman.

=== New Caprica ===
The humans settled on a barren planet they dubbed [[New Caprica]]. The refuge lasted a year before the Cylons found them. The Cylons occupied the new human settlement, at first peacefully but later forcefully and more viciously as the human Resistance increased. In the end they used punitive methods to keep the humans in line, including summary executions and infiltration by seemingly sympathetic Cylons. One such infiltrator was an Eight model who manipulated Felix Gaeta into giving her a list of people the Resistance desired to free from Cylon detention whom she then had executed.

=== Escape ===
Four months later the colonials escaped with the help of a resistance movement and the efforts of both the ''Galactica'' and ''Pegasus''. The escape required Athena's help. She entered the Cylon facility and took the keys to the various Colonial landing craft. Prior to this a [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Three]] found out from a human oracle that Hera was alive and on the planet. She rescued Hera after her adoptive mother was killed during the escape. The ''Pegasus'' sacrificed itself to save the crippled ''Galactica'', but the crew survived, joining ''Galactica''.

The Cylons then adopted the colonials’ mission to find the home of the Thirteenth Tribe, a planet they called Earth, intending to settle there. They resumed pursuit of the fleet, but upon reaching the Lion's Head Nebula, dispatched a Basestar to investigate. The Basestar took on board a canister left by the Thirteenth Tribe. The canister contained an airborne [[virus]] that proved deadly to the Cylons. The virus persisted through the download process so the Basestar that had been dispatched for the investigation was abandoned to avoid contamination. The colonial fleet discovered the Basestar and captured the ailing Cylons. The colonial fleet's attempt to use the virus to wipe out the Cylons was defeated when Helo, repulsed by the strategy, had the captive Cylons killed while out of range of a [[resurrection ship]].

Meanwhile, Boomer turned increasingly anti-human. She was charged with Hera's care, but Hera rejected her. During a truce negotiation, Boomer told Athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the Baseship. She invited Athena to come to the Baseship and rejoin her people, because the occupation showed that humans and Cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her. Later, desperate for her child, Athena convinced Helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the Baseship. Once there, she retrieved Hera with the help of Caprica Six who killed a hate-filled Boomer to prevent her from killing the child. She had tried to prevent Athena from taking Hera to the humans and declared that Cylons were never meant to have children. Caprica Six returned with Athena and was detained by Adama in Athena's old cell.

==== Cylon struggles ====
As the pursuit continued, internal relations among the Cylons began to break down. A Three violated her programming by actively seeking information about the Final Five, seeing a vision of them on the Algae Planet where the Colonials stopped to get food. From that she was able to identify them. She and her "twins" were then "boxed". Within the fleet a musical activation signal (a version of [[All Along the Watchtower]]) was received by the Final Five, awakening their memories and bringing them together. Two were ''Galactica'' crew members (Saul Tigh and Galen Tyrol), while Samuel Anders was an athlete and Tory Foster a political operative. They kept their discovery secret. Tigh and Anders remained loyal to the humans, willing to fight and possibly die for them. Tyrol and Foster were ambivalent, with Tyrol having pro-human leanings. Foster became increasingly anti-human, murdering Tyrol's wife without remorse. After their realization, the fleet came under attack but, during the battle, a Cylon Raider identified Anders and he and his fellow Raiders broke off the attack, refusing to fight.

This set off a debate in the Cylon government regarding the Raiders. Ones, Fours and Fives voted to "lobotomize" the Raiders to make them acquiescent. [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Twos]], Sixes and Eights, led principally by a Six named Natalie, became convinced that the Raiders had sensed the presence of the Final Five. Boomer’s assenting vote broke the tie. Natalie objected and removed inhibitor circuitry from the Centurions, granting them free will and independent thought. The Centurions then killed the models who were “lobotomizing” the Raiders.

In response, Cavil lured Natalie and her forces into a trap beyond resurrection range and slaughtered them. Only Natalie's crippled Basestar survived. With her Raiders destroyed except for some Heavy Raiders and the surviving Twos, Sixes and Eights (minus Boomer), Natalie allowed Two Leoben Conoy to locate Kara Thrace and ally with the humans. A deal was struck: the humans would help the rebels unbox the [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Threes]] and the rebels would lead the humans to the Resurrection Hub and help them destroy it so Cavil would lose resurrection forever. The humans transferred half of their Vipers to the Rebel Basestar. Fearing for Hera, Athena murdered Natalie, causing the Hybrid to jump the Rebel Basestar, with Roslin on board, away before everyone was ready. The Hybrid took the Basestar to the Hub where the allies had the human Vipers towed into battle by Cylon Heavy Raiders so they could catch the Cylons by surprise. The plan worked and the Hub's FTL drive was taken out, stranding it. While the Rebel Basestar engaged two other Basestars, Helo and an Eight boarded the Hub to unbox D'Anna and found her already unboxed by Cavil and Boomer. The three escaped and the Vipers nuked the Hub, destroying it and Cylon resurrection capability.

After a standoff, the identities of the four Cylons in the human fleet were revealed and together they found the devastated Earth, a nuclear wasteland. There, Tigh, Anders, Foster and Tyrol got flashes of their life on Earth and Tigh learned the identity of the fifth member: his dead wife Ellen. The humans and rebel Cylons (minus D'Anna), abandoned Earth in search of a new home together. The humans and Cylons ended up striking a deal: in return for joining the fleet as full members the rebels would upgrade the fleet's FTL drives with Cylon technology, increasing their jump distance by at least three times. This led to a political coup and failed mutiny, but left Anders seriously injured, although with his true memories returned. After telling the others as much as he could, Anders slipped into a coma from which he partially emerged while acting as ''Galactica's'' hybrid.

Cavil revealed that he had a resurrected Ellen Tigh as his prisoner, ever since her download after she was killed on New Caprica. Her resurrection restored her true memories, although her only company was Cavil and Boomer, whom he'd let in on the secret. After Cavil planned to dissect her brain to try to regain resurrection technology, Boomer helped Ellen escape to the fleet as part of a plan to kidnap Hera so the Cylons could study her.

''Galactica'' and some of the rebel Cylons assaulted the Cylon space station that was the Cylon homeworld, to rescue Hera while the Rebel Basestar protected the fleet. During the battle, Boomer, who had begun to feel remorse for kidnapping Hera, killed the Four that was starting to dissect the child and carried her back to her parents. Athena then killed Boomer. The rescue team returned to ''Galactica'' where Cavil led a Centurion assault, but was defeated. He took Hera hostage, but was convinced to create a permanent peace with the humans in exchange for the Final Five giving him resurrection technology.

Tyrol learns that Foster murdered Cally and breaks the download, causing the Cylons to attack again. Cavil kills himself. An unmanned Raptor is struck by an asteroid, causing the dead pilot (Racetrack) to fire eight nuclear missiles into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit and into a black hole, destroying it and every remaining One, Four and Five. ''Galactica'' jumps away and arrives at a habitable planet. The humans and rebel Cylons settle there while the rebel Centurions are given their freedom and the Rebel Basestar to find their own destiny. Anders flies the human fleet and all its technology into the Sun. 150,000 years later, it is revealed that the planet they settled on is our Earth, while Hera was [[Mitochondrial Eve]], which means all modern humans are partly descended from the humanoid Cylons.

== Centurions ==
The Cylon Centurion is a mechanical infantry model, made less intelligent than human models. ''BSGr'' Centurions retain the silver appearance, robotic body, helmet-like head and oscillating red bar eye of their forbearers but are larger, taller, stronger, more agile and have a more streamlined appearance. They also have retractable guns built into their lower arms, bladed fingertips and heavy armour.

The Centurions were monotheists who believed in a single loving God.

=== Initial models ===
The first colonial Centurion is seen and is identified as a 'Cybernetic Lifeform Node'. Built on contract for the Caprican Defense Ministry, the Cylons are to replace human warriors on the battlefield (''Caprica'' pilot).

The U-87 prototype Cylon contains a copy of the consciousness of Daniel Graystone's daughter, [[Zoe Graystone]]. Daniel Graystone conceives of the Cylons as a slave race and demonstrates this by instructing the prototype to rip her own arm off. After catching it interacting with the family dog, he realises that the prototype contains Zoe's consciousness and attempts without success to force her to admit her identity. She is able to defeat the tests he attempts, and convinces him that she is just a robot. Upon learning that Graystone is about to erase her memory, she escapes.

The [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|''Battlestar Galactica'' miniseries]] displays an original model Centurion on display in ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s museum hangar. The original Centurion is also depicted in a diagram reviewed by the armistice officer in the opening scene.

In ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Razor]]'', Centurions are almost identical to those from the original series, except they are rendered using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and have exposed joints. The Centurion in the museum hangar is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as a CGI version with exposed joints. Initial-model Centurions are among those seen defending the Cylon colony from an assault by Colonial and rebel Cylon forces (Part 2 of "[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak]]").

The body had synthetic skin, although this model was still primitive and was mechanical rather than biological.&lt;ref&gt;[DVD commentary with Kevin Murphy, ''Caprica'' Executive Producer ("Apotheosis")]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later model ===
Centurions do not download into new bodies when they are destroyed, according to screenwriter Ronald D. Moore The Hybrids have something to do with the programming of the Centurions. When the virus infected the Hybrid on the infected Basestar, the Centurions shut down ("[[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]"). However, Centurions can function independently when no Basestars or skinjobs are nearby. A Centurion immediately fires upon an Eight when she unplugs a Hybrid ("[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]"). It is unclear whether this was in willful defiance of the Hybrid or as a result of the removal of their higher function inhibitor modules ("[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]").

After the inhibitor modules that restrict higher functions, granting them independent thought were removed, although still largely servile, the Centurions were shown to exhibit human-like behaviour, such as politeness and consideration (e.g., responding to "please").

These Centurions are taller than their predecessors, and are sleeker. They possess less of a humanoid structure, averaging a head taller than humans. They retain the bipedal structure of the first model, as well as rough hands and feet. The feet of the new Centurions are a simple two-toed form that produces a distinctive sound when they walk as the toes move and touch the ground. They retain the distinctive, oscillating red "eye", as well as a rudimentary mouth (even though they cannot speak). The hands are much thinner and visibly segmented, and more claw-like (they can cut flesh and mortally wound a human,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 2, Episode 2 "Valley of Darkness".&lt;/ref&gt; making them effective close-combat weapons.) These claws can be modified at will, to a more 'finger-like' digit or less of a razor-sharp weapon.

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this model is the twin cannons built into each hand, mounted on the side, that can be deployed by retracting the hands. It was originally established that the Centurions could not move while firing their cannons, however in later seasons they were seen to walk and even run while firing. The Centurions carry heavy weapons, such as anti-aircraft rockets that are strapped to their backs, for missions where their cannons are not enough.&lt;ref&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 3, Episode 10 "The Eye of Jupiter".&lt;/ref&gt; Most Centurions can be destroyed or at least damaged by small-arms fire, however most require substantial artillery or special rounds to be destroyed (a Centurions party that boarded Galactica were especially strong, and required explosive rounds to be destroyed, as regular rounds proved completely ineffective&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;).

These Centurions greatly outmatched the previous model.&lt;ref&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 4, Episode 20 "Daybreak, Part II".&lt;/ref&gt; They were better-armoured, stronger, and carried internal weapons (as opposed to their predecessors, who needed to carry weapons such as rifles and pistols, like their human creators).

== Raiders ==
{{Main|Cylon Raider}}
The later form of Cylon Raiders are biomechanical entities integrated into small fighter spacecraft. They resurrect when they die. Raiders are subservient, and were compared to trained animals by the humanoid Cylons. A Raider nicknamed "[[Scar (Cylon)|Scar]]" developed a personality ("Scar"). Scar was the Cylons' top gun, driven by a bitter hatred of humans. He was killed and reborn many times. Raiders do not use vocal communication, appearing to communicate through unspecified electronic signals. Modern Raiders, unlike their predecessors in the First Cylon War, are alive, with a complex system of veins, organs and biological fluids contained within their main body.&lt;ref&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 1, Episode Five "You Can't Go Home Again".&lt;/ref&gt; The Raiders are programmed, but began with some measure of autonomy and personality. When one Raider saw a Final Five in the human fleet during an attack,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 4, Episode 1 "He That Believeth In Me".&lt;/ref&gt; it retreated, leading the remaining Raiders back to the Basestar. The Raiders then refused to fight the humans, for fear of harming their Cylon kin. This led to the lobotomy vote.

Well-trained Colonial pilots, even nuggets, can beat a Raider in most situations. The Raiders' primary advantage seemed to be in their massive numbers: while Galactica carries around 40 Vipers, Cylon Basestars support 300-600 Raiders. The Raiders are maneuverable, once described by Kara as a "squirmy son of a bitch", and most human pilots were unable to keep them in sight for more than a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Battlestar Galactica, Season 2, Episode 15 "Scar".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weapons ===
The Raiders' primary weapons are two [[kinetic energy]] guns mounted on the underside of their wings, close to the main body. They may carry conventional missiles and tactical [[nuclear weapons]]. Raiders, by revealing their red "eye", can transmit deadly [[computer viruses]] or signals to enemy ships, which strike with brutal efficiency and can shut down Colonial vessels, turning off their power and making them easy prey. If all else fails, Raiders sometimes attempt suicide attacks. A single Raider can destroy a sizeable transport.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

The Raiders from the First Cylon War were larger spacecraft driven by Centurion pilots, and not alive. These are used by the remaining First War Centurions guarding the Original Hybrid and the Cylon Colony, and later became obsolete.

=== Heavy Raiders ===
The later Cylon Raiders are different from [[Cylon Heavy Raider]]s. Like the raiders of the First Cylon War, the Heavy Raiders are transports and attack bombers, and are primarily piloted by Sixes and Eights.

== Humanoid cylons ==
Although they made only a single appearance in the original continuity (the episode "[[The Night the Cylons Landed]]" from ''[[Galactica 1980]]'') humanoid Cylons are the focus of the reimagining. They are usually known as "the Cylons", or derogatorily as "skinjobs" or "toasters". Skinjobs are indistinguishable from humans due to their creation through synthetic biology, employing real bones, flesh and blood rather than metal, but still possess a "digital molecular structure". Some are programmed to believe that they are "organic" until otherwise informed.

The Cylons can communicate nonverbally, but do not have a hive mind, even among a single model, and are most often shown talking to one another.

The thirteen distinct humanoid models are divided into the "Final Five" that originated on Earth, and "Significant Seven" (the latter term is only used by the ''Battlestar Galactica'' producers). The Final Five are unique, and are the last survivors of the Thirteenth Tribe. They developed the Seven (originally eight) in conjunction with the Centurions of the Twelve Colonies. Each copy shares biology and general personality throughout their model, but they develop into distinct individuals. The Final Five showed the Centurions how to make skinjobs and attempted to give them human characteristics (love, mercy), thinking that these characteristics would prevent war.  

Prior to the "Final Five" arriving to stop the first Cylon War on Caprica, the Centurions had already made their first humanoid, called the Hybrid, for the purpose of controlling the baseship.  Once the Final Five arrived on Caprica, they transferred their technology to the Centurions and gave them eight fully humanoid models created by them.

Cylon society is made up of the seven, whose types are numbered One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six and Eight. The extinct Seven model (the "Daniel" series) was destroyed by a One decades prior to the Colonies' destruction.

== Origin ==  
{{long-section|date=November 2018}}
As revealed towards the end of season 4, there is a 2000 year gap between the exodus of the first humanoid Cylons (the Final Five) from the destruction of life on Earth due to a robot Centurion war there, and their arrival at Caprica in the middle of the Caprican robot Centurion war.  Originally, the Final Five had left Earth both to seek a new home and to warn the other Twelve Colonies about the dangers of mistreating Centurions so that they might avoid the fate of Earth. However, at the time FTL (faster than light) starship jumping technology was unknown, so they made the journey using slower than light technology, resurrecting themselves when their bodies wore out over the span of 2000 years.  

It should be noted that when the Earth was nuked, 2000 years prior, the Final Five Cylons had already planned for this event and were resurrected onto their baseship in orbit when their bodies were destroyed in a global nuclear attack that wiped out all life on Earth.  This resurrection was the event which triggered the Final Five Cylons to begin their 2000 year journey to Caprica, only to find out upon arrival that humans and Centurion robots had begun fighting towards extinction just as they had 2000 years prior on Earth.

The Final Five arrived at Caprica to discover that the Caprican Centurions had already begun experimenting with creating humanoid Cylons by creating the first Hybrid to control their baseship.  As part of the agreement to end the war with humans, the Final Five Cylons gave the Caprican Centurions eight humanoid Cylon models and a resurrection ship.  

During the 40-year gap between the end of the first Cylon war and the second Cylon war on Caprica, Cavil, model number One of the eight humanoid Cylons that the Final Five had designed and created, rebelled against the Final Five and took command of the Centurions and of the other humanoid Cylons.  In order to get rid of the Final Five who blocked him from continuing the Cylon war, he tricked the Final Five into to living on Caprica with their memories erased and false memories implanted.  He was deluded into believing that he could show the Final Five that they were wrong about humans by letting them suffer with the humans as their civilization was destroyed (as a result of him restarting the Cylon war) and then restoring their memories while resurrecting them on the Cylon baseship. Cavil thought this lesson would help the Final Five realize that humans were flawed creatures and thus persuade them to take his side.

Ellen, the original creator of the eight humanoid models, programmed them with a belief in a single God that is all-loving.  She did this because she wanted the Cylons to know love and to be peaceful and to avoid war in the future.  However, Cavil rejected his programming of believing in an all-loving God. Other Cylons, particularly the D'Anna model, justified attacking the humans perhaps as a form of religious fundamentalism, with the goal of remaking the world as a Cylon One-God utopia.

In addition, Cavil regarded the creation of humanoid Cylons as a mistake and believed that Cylons should return to a purely mechanical form so that they could experience the world in ways not limited by human senses. For example, he said that when a star explodes into a supernova, he wants to see the X-rays and gamma rays with his eyes, and not be limited by biological human eyes.  

Cavil was fearful of the mechanical Centurions, rejecting the secret removal of circuitry to prevent the Centurions from having free will in Season 4. When Centurions on one of the Cylon baseships received this modification and thus developed free will, they revolted against Cavil because they rejected his policy of removing the biological brains of the Raider ships and returning them to a purely mechanical form so that they would follow orders without emotion interfering. This small rebellion left the Sixes and Eights in charge of one of the baseships in the Cylon fleet. The rebel baseship later forms an alliance with the human fleet after being attacked by Cavil's Cylon fleet and left to drift in space without FTL propulsion.

== Roles ==
The skinjobs are responsible for command decisions. While the command structure has not been fully explored, some hints at organization are known. At the end of the mini-series, a group of skinjobs debate what to do, and one speaks authoritatively, to which another responds, "by your command", a reference to the original series. They can freely impose blocks on the behavior and cognitive programming of Centurions, Raiders and Hybrids. Multiple skinjobs with blocked memories are spread among the surviving humans, including members of ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s crew.

A Cylon council (made up of multiple copies of several models) appears to cast votes collectively by model, indicating that model plays an important role in the structure of Cylon society ("[[Precipice (Battlestar Galactica)|Precipice]]"). Some models are implied to have higher or lower ranks than others. During the occupation of New Caprica, a select group of individuals, who mostly had been within the Colonies, such as Boomer and Caprica Six, seemed to have seniority within their model. One of each model was seen deliberating and discussing their course of action, with each of the 'senior' copies representing the opinion of their model.

Although little is known about Cylon psychology, it is clear that they share many human emotional vulnerabilities. This is evidenced by Gina's catatonic state as a result of the severe trauma of her abuse at the hands of the ''Pegasus'' crew. This abuse was presented in the form of multiple sexual assaults, battery, starvation and outright torture. [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Six/Caprica Six]] also revealed that Cylons exist by 'projecting' an environment of their choice on the real/physical world.

=== Number One (John Cavil) ===
{{Main|John Cavil}}

Ones subvert consensus by undertaking many actions without the knowledge or consent of their siblings, such as turning against the Sevens and the Final Five, and then reprogramming their siblings to hide this.

The main antagonist of the series, John Cavil, initially poses as a priest ("[[Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)|Lay Down Your Burdens]]"). His true identity is revealed when a second copy boards ''Galactica'' and reveals his Cylon nature. Cavil's role in society is contradictory. He occasionally serves as a devil's advocate, pointing out the absurdity of his fellow Cylons and their religious zealotry. He was revealed to be a One ("Six of One").

Cavil has a sadistic, [[Machiavellian]] streak that none of the other Cylon models share. He tortured [[Saul Tigh]] by gouging out one of his eyes and showing it to him. He took pleasure in blackmailing [[Ellen Tigh]] into providing sexual favours in exchange for releasing Saul from captivity on New Caprica.

Cavil is an atheist (alone among the seven models), and often mockingly uses [[air quotes]] when saying the word "God". His opinions of humans are contradictory. He is one of the most violently anti-human Cylon models, advocating a policy of culling humanity down to a "controllable number". He claimed to have been against the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and advocates a unique Cylon Society, not one that emulates its creators. After arranging Tigh's release, Cavil further manipulated the situation by again blackmailing Ellen to betray the human resistance on New Caprica and threatening to kill Saul if she did not comply.

Cavil is aloof compared to the other models, though Boomer implies that Cavil has begun teaching her his views that Cylons should not emulate humanity. Cavil knows aspects of Cylon lore that the others models do not. His knowledge of the Final Five led him to box the D'Anna and the other Threes to ensure that whatever she had learned about the Final Five stayed hidden.

He was made in Ellen's father's image. Ellen also named him "John". He hates this name and shows deep resentment towards Ellen at being 'limited' by having to live in a humanoid body.

One was the first model and helped the Final Five create the other seven. Therefore, Ones knew about the Final Five while the others knew only that they existed. For an unstated reason, Cavil rejected the human trait of mercy and turned against the Final Five.

When the Final Five were resurrected, Cavil implants new memories for their life in the Twelve Colonies. He also alters the original programming of the seven other models so that searching for, talking about, and even thinking about the Final Five was strictly forbidden.

Ones are played by [[Dean Stockwell]].

=== Number Two (Leoben Conoy) ===
{{Main|Leoben Conoy}}
Leoben first appears as a smuggler at the munitions depot at [[Ragnar Anchorage]], where he was exposed as a Cylon ([[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|mini-series]]). Twos are religious zealots, carrying a pathological, and sometimes sexual, obsession with Starbuck. His Cylon identity was revealed ("[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]").

Twos are skilled at deceit. Conoy manipulates Starbuck into thinking that a young girl he had kidnapped on New Caprica is her biological daughter. Twos display cunning minds and the ability to find and exploit others' weaknesses. Unlike other Cylons, Twos appear to be prescient and on several occasions prophesy future events.

Twos are played by [[Callum Keith Rennie]].

=== Number Three (D'Anna Biers) ===
{{Main|Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)}}
D'Anna Biers was a reporter for the Fleet News Service. Roslin and Adama grant Biers access to all areas of Galactica to investigate her suspicions of a military cover-up surrounding civilian deaths aboard the Gideon. Their belief is that Biers will discover that military personnel deal with the same pressures and fears as the rest of the fleet, and that the events were a tragic mistake. The Biers model used the documentary as a means to relay information that Sharon was alive to Cylons on Caprica ("[[Final Cut (Battlestar Galactica)|Final Cut]]"). D'Anna was revealed to be a Three in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]".

Threes are among the more aggressive models, and share a fatalistic understanding of the Cylon religion, believing that everything that happens is the will of God. Their religious devotion masks a deep questioning by Threes about why God allows bad things to happen ([[Theodicy]]).

Threes possess an "alpha-female" aggressiveness, advancing themselves as de facto leaders in any situation. They are often rivals of Ones and Sixes. The rivalry with the Sixes partly stems from when [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica-Six]] killed a Three to save [[Samuel Anders]] from torture and death. D'Anna and Caprica-Six later reconcile and both of them are involved in a relationship with Baltar. Baltar seduces D'Anna by exploring her crisis of faith, which leads to her secretly committing suicide (a major Cylon taboo) to experience resurrection. She feels these near-death experiences will answer questions regarding her faith, notably the identity of the Final Five. D'Anna eventually sees the faces of the Final Five ("[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]"). Unfortunately, as she does so, the other Cylons vote to box all Threes. Cavil tells her that what she had seen regarding the Final Five was unacceptable and that her memories would be kept in "cold storage". D'Anna, but not the other Threes, is later unboxed ("The Hub").

Threes are among the more anti-human Cylons. D'Anna tells Baltar that she believes that humanity must die to prevent future generations of humans from seeking revenge ("Exodus" Part II). She is temporarily the leader of the "rebel" faction of Cylons that makes peace with the human fleet, but when the first Earth is found to be a devastated ruin, she decides to stay there and die rather than continuing the cycle of death, exodus and rebirth.

Threes are played by [[Lucy Lawless]].

=== Number Four (Simon O'Neill) ===
{{Main|Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)}}
O'Neill poses as a human physician who treats Starbuck for a gunshot wound in what was supposedly a resistance hospital on Caprica ("[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]"). In reality this was a Cylon "farm" set up to breed human-Cylon hybrids using captured humans. Simon performed invasive tests on Starbuck's reproductive organs. He was revealed to be the 4th model in the episode "Six of One". Fours are consistently medical specialists.

Another Four poses as a married man in the Colonial Fleet. Cavil at one point asks Simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on. He defies this order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock. He was not close enough to a Resurrection Ship and therefore died permanently ("''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]''").

Fours are played by [[Rick Worthy]].

=== Number Five (Aaron Doral) ===
{{Main|Aaron Doral|Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)}}
Doral debuts as a public relations worker for the abortive ''Galactica'' museum ([[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|miniseries]]). Another Five sneaks aboard the ''Galactica'' and detonates an explosive ("[[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]]"). This event prompts the fleet-wide announcement that Cylons can have a human appearance. He was revealed to be the 5th model in the episode "Downloaded."

During the Occupation of New Caprica, the Fives are anti-human and aggressive. They specialize in public relations and control, using large-scale events and [[media manipulation]].

Fives are played by [[Matthew Bennett]].

=== Number Six (Caprica-Six / Shelly Godfrey / Gina Inviere / Natalie Faust / Lida / Sonja) ===
{{Main|Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)}}
The first model explicitly revealed to be a Cylon in the mini-series, Sixes often use seduction to their advantage. Important copies include Shelly Godfrey, Gina Inviere, Head Six, Caprica Six and Natalie.

==== Caprica Six ====
One of the Sixes, later known as Caprica Six, on her way to meet with Baltar, murders an infant by breaking its neck. This could either be considered sociopathic or a mercy killing due to the coming Cylon attack. She saves Baltar's life when his house was struck by a blast wave from the Cylon attack.

Caprica Six has a love-hate relationship with Baltar, alternately defending him to other Cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands.

A reincarnation of Caprica Six commits the first incident of Cylon-on-Cylon violence, killing a Three with a rock to save Ander's life.

Caprica Six was imprisoned on ''Galactica'' after helping Athena escape from the Cylons with Hera. She offers to testify against Baltar. While in the brig, she has a relationship with Saul Tigh that results in the first Cylon-Cylon pregnancy in 2,000 years, which ends in a miscarriage.

Caprica Six has an "Inner Baltar" which only she sees, similar to how Baltar has an "Inner Six" that only he can see; Inner Baltar serves as a sort of conscience for Caprica Six and as an advisor in times of trouble, as Inner Six does for him. Inner Baltar appears at least once to Baltar himself. Before their true nature is revealed, speculation rises that Baltar is a Cylon. Inner Baltar and Inner Six appear to Baltar and Caprica Six &amp;ndash; all four sharing a moment together &amp;ndash; as the first part of the revelation that the "Inners" are divine beings (referred to as "[[Angel]]s") manipulating both the Colonials and Cylons into fulfilling "God's plan" ([[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|series finale]]).

==== Shelly Godfrey ====
Godfrey was on Galactica after the Cylon attack. She accused Baltar of treasonously sabotaging human defenses, and therefore of killing several million people (''[[Six Degrees of Separation (Battlestar Galactica)|Six Degrees of Separation)]]''. She also appears in ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]'' TV movie.

==== Gina Inviere ====
Gina acted as a contractor for ''Pegasus'' and was in a relationship with [[Admiral Cain]]. When Cain discovered that Gina was a Cylon agent, she ordered her crew to "push her programming" in an attempt to see if Gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma. Gina later escaped with Baltar's aid, assassinated Cain and founded a resistance group in the fleet, preaching peace with the Cylons. While it seemed that Gina developed feelings for Baltar and wanted to pursue him, she detonated a nuclear warhead (provided by Baltar) that destroyed Cloud Nine, other fleet ships and generated an electromagnetic signature, the detection of which ultimately led the Cylon fleet to New Caprica.

==== Sonja and Natalie ====
Other important Sixes include Natalie, who originally leads the rebel Cylon faction against Cavil's faction before she is killed by Athena in a misunderstanding, and Sonja, who was elected to represent the rebel Cylons in the Colonial fleet's Quorum of Ships' Captains.

Sixes are played by [[Tricia Helfer]].

=== Number Seven (Daniel) ===
Daniel was the seventh Cylon model ("[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]"). Ellen refers to Daniel as an "artist, and so sensitive to the world". She was very close to Daniel, which enraged Cavil; he felt that Daniel was Ellen's favorite and became jealous. Cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid used to mature the Daniel copies and then corrupted Daniel's genetic code. This sabotage meant that no further Sevens could be created. The original was also killed with [[Samuel Anders]] stating at one point that "Daniel died" after regaining his true memories. 

Fans speculated that Starbuck or her father was a version of the corrupted Seven line. Instead Daniel is merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavil's character (noting that Daniel is essentially the [[Cain and Abel|Abel to Cavil's Cain]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]] podcast&lt;/ref&gt; The Sevens were a springboard for ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', where Daniel Graystone is the name of a main character played by [[Eric Stoltz]]; this Daniel is the creator of the Colonial Centurions.&lt;ref&gt;"[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]" podcast&lt;/ref&gt;

Sevens are never seen in the series, and their physical appearance is never described.

=== Number Eight (Sharon "Boomer" Valerii / Sharon "Athena" Agathon) ===
{{Main|Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)}}At the end of the miniseries, a Six says "By your command" to an Eight. This phrase is usually spoken to the Imperious leader in the old series by Centurions. It seemed to give this particular Eight a leadership role.

==== Boomer ====
[[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Sharon "Boomer" Valerii]] first appears as a Raptor pilot aboard the ''Galactica''. Her true nature as a Cylon was revealed at the end of the miniseries. She acted as a [[sleeper agent]], unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without realizing what she is doing. She was revealed to be an Eight in the episode "Downloaded".

==== Athena ====
The other significant Eight, [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Athena" Agathon|Sharon "Athena" Agathon]], married [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]], rebelled against the Cylons and joined forces with the Colonials. Her child with Helo, a daughter named [[Hera Agathon|Hera]], is the first Cylon/human hybrid. Such a child is the subject of a Cylon prophecy. Its importance increased as it was a 'child born of love'. Shortly after Hera's birth, Roslin decides to mislead the Cylons into believing the child has died. Her plan involves lying to Athena and Helo, and giving the child to an adoptive mother, Maya. While aiding the Colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on New Caprica, Athena sneaks into a Cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on New Caprica. She is discovered by D'Anna, who informs her that Hera is still alive, citing strange dreams and a prophecy by a human mystic as proof. Athena, believing this to be a ruse, [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] D'Anna. During the exodus from New Caprica, Hera's caregiver is killed and D'Anna finds the baby. Boomer later tells Athena that Hera lives. Athena has Helo kill her (Athena), allowing her to download into a new body within the Cylon fleet. With the help of Caprica Six, she rescues Hera and returns to ''Galactica''.

Eight is described as "weak" by Baltar's Head Six, and Eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other Cylons. However, they fully supported the destruction of the Colonies. The actions of Boomer and an Eight who had a duplicitous affair with [[Felix Gaeta]] on New Caprica make it clear that Eights are capable of homicide and betrayal. Eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from Cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family. They vote to save humanity in the Cylon civil war that Boomer starts. She hesitates for a while when Cavil influences her, but in the end chooses to support the humans, even if it means that she must give up her life.

Athena becomes completely assimilated in human culture. Her child and husband become her life's focus. She is the only Cylon to create a family. The Eight's perceived fragility camouflage great strength and direction. In one episode, Athena hardwires herself to Galactica, hacks into a Cylon fleet and shuts them down.

Eights are played by [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]].

== Final Five {{Anchor|Final Five}} ==
Cavil killed and boxed the Final Five. Later he resurrected them, purged their memories and sent them to live among the humans. The other six models had no knowledge of the Final Five's identities, presumably blocked by Cavil, though they were aware of the existence of five absent models who were not to be spoken of. When D'Anna (a Three) attempts to learn their identities, Cavil boxes her entire model line as punishment. In the final episode of the third season, four of the final five are revealed to be characters with long histories on the ''Galactica''. Their purpose, and how and why they were hidden from the rest of their kind, is a major plot point of the fourth and final season when Ellen Tigh is revealed to be the fifth member.[[File:Battlestar Galactica 3x10 The Passage - Final Five.jpg|thumb|The "Final Five" Cylons drawn in a crude sketch by Three]]

=== Backstory ===
The Final Five were Cylon models who could not be named or researched by skinjobs ("[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]"). They were the original humanoid Cylons, born 2,000 years before the series, on Earth, as part of the Thirteenth Tribe. ("[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]") They were born to Cylon parents through sexual reproduction, rather than built. They were the researchers who rebuilt the Cylon resurrection technology that had been abandoned when the Thirteenth Tribe gained the ability to procreate. Saul and Ellen were married at the time, while Tyrol and Foster were in love and planned to marry ("[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]").

While on Earth the Final Five learned of the upcoming attack on the Colonies from beings ("Angels") only they can see. They placed the resurrection technology on a ship in Earth orbit. When the nuclear attack kills them, they resurrect on the ship and head for the Colonies to warn them. They arrive during the [[First Cylon War]], unbeknownst to the humans, and make a deal with the Centurions: stop the war and they will help them build human bodies. They build the first model, One (Cavil), who helps them build seven other models ("[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]").

Cavil then kills and boxes the Five and removes the memory of their identities from the other Cylons. He later unboxes them, replacing their memories. Cavil periodically seeds them among the human populations starting with Saul, and then Ellen, to show them the evils of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Other Cylons do not talk about the Five ("[[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]").

=== Identities ===
Saul Tigh ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) and Galen Tyrol ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) are ''Galactica'' officers, while Samuel T. Anders ([[Michael Trucco]]) is an athlete on Caprica. Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) is a political operative who is rescued from Caprica and works for Roslin. Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), is the fifth member, as Saul later realizes as more of his memory returns. ("[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]") Ellen resurrected after she is poisoned by Saul for giving rescue mission plan to Cavil on New Caprica. This restores her memory of her life as a Cylon ("[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]").

=== Story ===
The Five awaken when they begin to hear strange music. This seems to affect other Cylons. A Raider scans Anders and disengages an attack. Aboard ''Galactica'', Caprica Six tells Roslin that she can feel the Final Five and that they are near. ("[[He That Believeth In Me]]") Twos, Sixes and Eights believe that the Raiders called off the attack because they sensed the Final Five, something with which the Ones, Fours and Fives disagree. This disagreement leads directly to the Cylon Civil War, in which the Twos, Sixes, and Eights rebel ("Six of One"). A standoff between ''Galactica'' and the rebel Baseship exposes the four as Cylons to the humans, but Lee Adama, in his capacity as acting President, grants them amnesty as part of an alliance ("[[Revelations (Battlestar Galactica)|Revelations]]").

Only Anders and Ellen regain their complete memories: when Anders gets shot in the head, it seems to break Cavil's block on his memory, while Ellen's resurrection restores all of her memories. Cavil had planned for the Five to die in the destruction of the Colonies, download, regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity (''The Plan''). Instead, four of the Final Five survive the destruction of the Colonies without resurrecting (Tigh and Tyrol were on ''Galactica'' and Tory and Anders survived through luck) while Cavil kept Ellen alive so she could suffer more and learn her "lesson". Cavils' plan thus fails, as all of the Five (with the possible exception of Foster) maintain their loyalty to humanity.

They play a major role in ending the second war, taking a prominent role in the Battle of The Colony, especially Anders who acts as ''Galactica's'' Hybrid and shuts down the Colony's weapons and Hybrids. The Five also nearly bring a peace between human and Cylon by exchanging resurrection technology (which can only be rebuilt by the combined knowledge of the Five) for peace.

They see each other's memories and Tyrol learns that Tory had murdered his wife. In a rage, he strangles her, shattering the temporary peace, although a fortuitous nuclear explosion and Cavil's subsequent suicide effectively ends the war moments later.

After escaping and reaching a new Earth, Anders flies the fleet into the Sun, destroying it and himself, leaving only three of the Final Five alive.

== Hybrids ==
{{Main|Cylon Basestar#The Hybrid|Cylon Basestar#The First Hybrid}}
The Hybrids resemble human beings inside an immersion tank similar to a Cylon rebirthing tank. The Hybrids are [[cyborg]]s, consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to biological elements. The Hybrid is not one of the "thirteen models". It represents a step on the path from mechanical Centurion, to partially bio-mechanical Raider, to Hybrid, to skinjob. Hybrids are so integrated into the basestar's functionality that they are, for all practical purposes, its brains.

Hybrids continually speak what most of the humanoid Cylons consider to be gibberish, although there is some difference of opinion on this point. Many Cylons believe a hybrid's conscious mind is completely mad and the functions it performs are part of a deeper state of mind in connection with the ship. Caprica Six states that the Conoy model believes that every word a hybrid says is channeled from the Cylon god. A Hybrid is not allowed to vote in the Cylon democratic process, though it sometimes objects to the resulting decisions, for example, leaving another basestar full of disease-infected Cylons to their fates.&lt;ref name="A Measure of Salvation"&gt;{{cite episode | episodelink=A Measure of Salvation (Battlestar Galactica) | title=A Measure of Salvation | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Hybrid, considered the ''First Hybrid'' in Cylon lore, was the result of experiments on humans during the First Cylon War and appears to be more coherent and prophetic than the others. It went rogue as early as the end of the First War, and is protected by model 0005 Cylons called Guardians, who consider it their god. According to the skinjobs, the First Hybrid and its Guardians are legends. The Colonial Fleet accidentally clashes with the Guardians, destroying them, the First Hybrid along with its basestar. The First Hybrid has the appearance of an old man, whereas the standard Hybrids look like young women and are identical.

After he is shot in the head and enters a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]], [[Samuel Anders]] is connected to a datastream and as a result develops Hybrid-like abilities, whereupon he acts as ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Hybrid. When hooked up, he speaks and acts like a Hybrid. This shows that apparently under special circumstances, normal Cylons, or at least the Final Five, can become Hybrid-like beings.

The Basestar Hybrids are played by Tiffany Lyndall-Knight. The First Hybrid is played by [[Campbell Lane]].

== Religion ==
Humanoid Cylons, except for the Cavil models, follow a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]. [[Religious fanaticism]] partially motivates their attempted genocide of humanity. Despite their origins the Cylons believe themselves to be spiritual beings. This monotheism seems to share some of the characteristics as the [[Abrahamic religion]]s: belief that God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, that he will one day deliver [[divine retribution]] and that he intervenes in the mundane world. Their beliefs are different from the Abrahamic religions in that they deal with issues such as consciousness, [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and [[reincarnation]].

Moore said that this spirituality comes when a species becomes [[Sentience|sentient]] and [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] – questioning faith and religion and about what happens after death.&lt;ref name="beliefnet"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The different Cylon models have slightly different ways of talking about and dealing with their god, reflecting the different aspects of humanity that each Cylon model reflects.&lt;ref name="beliefnet" /&gt; [[Brother Cavil|Ones]] do not all believe in God and can be [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[Atheism|atheist]]. In contrast, Twos are fanatically religious.

== Vulnerabilities ==
Some Cylons are physically stronger than humans. While this is obvious with respect to Centurions, the extent to which the Twelve are also is unclear. In the miniseries, William Adama fought with a Two who, despite suffering from the effects of radiation, proved to be stronger. The Two managed to break off a metal pipe to use as a club and lift Adama off the floor with one arm. Another Two was able to break apart a pair of metal handcuffs while under interrogation ("Flesh and Bone"). A Six engaged Kara Thrace hand-to-hand and proved to be exceptionally fast, agile and strong ("Kobol's Last Gleaming II"). Despite this Cylons are vulnerable to most of the same things as humans. The Two who fought Adama was beaten to death with a flashlight, while the Six who fought Thrace was impaled by a piece of [[rebar]]. While the Twelve may match or exceed human strength, they do not display superhuman powers or resilience. Cylon skin appears just as vulnerable to breaking as human skin, bleeding just as a comparable wound would in a human.

Cylons' mental faculties are sufficiently similar to those of a human to allow for manipulation. Cain and Thrace exploited this fact while 'interrogating' Cylons. The experience of death (even with resurrection) is traumatic and can leave deep emotional damage.

Cylons are susceptible to an ancient [[virus]] that can be transmitted by rodents to which humans are immune, [[lymphocytic choriomeningitis|lymphocytic encephalitis]]. This virus was carried on a beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe at the Lion's Head Nebula millennia before and disrupts all organic Cylon technology including Raiders, Hybrids (which in turn disrupts Centurions) and the skinjobs. The humans speculate that the beacon was accidentally contaminated when someone sneezed. The Cylons believe that a critical symptom of this virus, a harmful [[bioelectric]] [[feedback]], can be transmitted during a download and attempt to prevent infected Cylons from downloading. The only immune Cylon is Athena, who had given birth to a half-human child and thus 'inherited' human antibodies from her offspring (although it is unclear whether she retained this immunity after downloading).

[[Dr. Cottle]] developed a vaccine after some Twelves were infected on a basestar near the Lion's Head Nebula. The disease requires regular booster shots to keep an infected Cylon healthy. The Cylons failed to develop a cure or a vaccine to the virus.

Cylons' silica pathways are affected by certain forms of radiation, such as that surrounding Ragnar Anchorage. It is assumed but not stated that this radiation affects all of the skinjobs as the station was chosen as a refuge by Commander Adama before he learned of the existence of biomechanical models. The radiation had deleterious effects on the Two they found at Ragnar Anchorage but not on Adama. This suggests that humans are not vulnerable to this type of radiation.

[[Plutonium]] is used for Baltar's Cylon Detector because its radiation affects humans and Cylons differently. The detector was dropped as a method of exposing hidden Cylons early in Season 2 as the revelation that Boomer (a test subject) was a Cylon convinced the command staff that the detector did not work.

On October 29, 2005 he defeated Sod Kokietgym by unanimous decision, handing Looknongyangtoy his first career loss.&lt;ref&gt;Knish, Joey (2006-10-20) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061120222818/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/4518/daniel-ponce-leon-lion-den/ Daniel Ponce De Leon In The Lion's Den]. thesweetscience.com&lt;/ref&gt; He has defended his [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[junior featherweight]] title eight times against Gerson Guerrero, Reynaldo Lopez, Sod Kokietgym twice, [[Al Seeger]], [[Gerry Peñalosa]], [[Rey Bautista]] and Eduardo Escobedo. Ponce de León's first loss was a unanimous decision loss to [[Celestino Caballero]] on February 17, 2005.

===Super featherweight contention===
On March 5, 2011, De Leon moved up to the super featherweight division to face undefeated prospect [[Adrien Broner]]. The fight was expected to be a showcase bout for the younger and larger Broner, however, De Leon proved to be more competitive than anticipated as Broner was awarded a highly disputed ten round unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;LaBate, Chris (2011-03-05) [http://www.boxingscene.com/adrien-broner-decisions-daniel-ponce-de-leon-ten--36670 Adrien Broner Decisions Daniel Ponce De Leon in Ten – Boxing News].

===WBC featherweight champion===
In an upset, Ponce de Leon emerged victorious over WBC featherweight champion Jhonny Gonzalez, coming away with an eighth-round unanimous technical decision victory before a sold-out crowd at Saturday night's Showtime-televised event at the MGM Grand.

The bout ended when a nasty gash emerged over the right eye of Gonzalez (52–8, 45 KOs), of Mexico City, after which it was determined that Gonzalez could not continue, they went to the scorecards and he won via: 79–72, 79–72, 77–74, all for Ponce de Leon. Ponce de Leon fought Abner Mares in the [[Floyd Mayweather vs. Robert Guerrero|Mayweather-Guerrero]] undercard on May 4, 2013 and got knocked down in the second and ninth rounds en route to a TKO loss at 2:20 of the ninth round, losing his WBC featherweight title in the process.

'''Emile Frank Verlaine Dechaineux''', [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (3 October 1902&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1944) was an [[Australia]]n mariner who reached the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He was killed by a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] aircraft in what is believed to have been the first ever ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack, in the lead-up to the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].

==Biography==
[[File:HMAS Australia bridge.jpg|300px|thumb|Dechaineux (second right) on the bridge of [[HMAS Australia (1927)|HMAS ''Australia'']] in September 1944.]]

Dechaineux was born in [[Launceston, Tasmania]], to a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born father, Florent Vincent Emile Lucien Dechaineux, and an Australian mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dechaineux-emile-frank-verlaine-9940 Australian Dictionary of Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Jervis Bay]]  at the age of 14, graduated three years later, and was promoted to [[Midshipman]] in 1920. In the first half of the 20th century, the RAN worked very closely with the British [[Royal Navy]] (RN), frequently exchanging personnel. Dechaineux spent much of the 1920s training with the RN as a torpedo officer and naval air observer.

In September 1932 Dechaineux achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander. In 1935 he was appointed Squadron Torpedo Officer, on board [[HMAS Canberra (1927)|HMAS ''Canberra'']]. The following year he married Mary Harbottle. In 1937, Dechaineux returned to the UK to attend the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] and in June he was promoted to [[Commander]].

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Dechaineux was attached to the RN Tactical and Minesweeping divisions until April 1940. Then, as the commander of the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vivacious|HMS ''Vivacious'']], he made five trips to assist [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of Dunkirk.

On 26 May the ship was allocated to Dynamo. At first, deployed from Dover, on 27 May the ship patrolled the beaches off Dunkirk, providing general anti-aircraft cover and protecting against fast E-boat attacks while scores of vessels crossed the mercifully semi-calm Channel in evacuation. The pleasure steamer ''Mona’s Isle'', for example, now fitted out as an armed boarding vessel, was amongst the many.  But her machineguns were no match for the attacking aircraft and occasional ship of the enemy: she was bombed as she reached the open sea outside Britain, and 40 on board were killed. This was the new and dangerous world of Dechaineux in action for the first time.

The next day the destroyer made two trips from Dunkirk to Dover, bringing out 326 men in the first trip and 359 in the second; one can only imagine the crowding of every interior space and her weather deck by so many men. Two days later another 537 men were safely landed in the British port.  On 31 May the vessel came under fire from shore batteries off Bray and sustained 15 casualties. Dechaineux received a minor wound to his forehead and a piece of shrapnel tore the back of his trousers   In a letter to his wife he remarked “I am very grateful that the ship was heading away from the gunfire, rather than towards it!”  On 1 June another 427 men were brought back to Dover.

On 3 June the destroyer was directed to take part in Operation OK, which sank blockships, to provide a temporary wharfage point, in Dunkirk Harbour. Vivacious safely brought the crews of these ships back across the Channel.  Altogether the destroyer brought out a total of 1,649 passengers from Dunkirk during five voyages. The evacuation lasted nine days, and safely brought hundreds of thousands of men back to Britain. Four years later, many would return for the D-Day landings. Dechaineux had proved his worth during his baptism of fire, not only by commanding the ship through battle, but also through the effective leadership of his men.  He was destined for greater things.

On 25 September 1940 he was given command of the brand new Hunt-class escort destroyer, HMS Eglington. After working up to satisfactory operational capability in Scapa Flow – where the ship and her captain were assessed by RN experts – the last months of the year were spent on North Sea convoy escort duties, as was 1941, although on 4 October the ship carried out a brief search for a German destroyer reported minelaying off South Foreland.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tom. [[The Submarine Six.]] Adelaide: Avonmore Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[[London Gazette]]: [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=35204&amp;geotype=London&amp;gpn=3745&amp;type=ArchivedSupplementPage&amp;all=&amp;exact=&amp;atleast=&amp;similar= (Supplement) no. 35204, page 3745], 27 June 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Dechaineux returned to Australia later in 1941, as Director of Operations at the Navy Office in Melbourne. In June 1943, following the outbreak of [[Pacific War|war with Japan]], he was given command of the tactical (destroyer) component of RAN-[[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Task Force 74]]. From his immediate command, [[HMAS Warramunga (I44)|HMAS ''Warramunga'']], Dechaineux commanded operations in waters around Australia and [[New Guinea]], including support for amphibious landings, such as those in the [[Admiralty Islands]]. He was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on 31 December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[London Gazette]]: [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=36326&amp;geotype=London&amp;gpn=229&amp;type=ArchivedIssuePage&amp;all=&amp;exact=&amp;atleast=&amp;similar= (Supplement) no. 36326, page 229], 11 January 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 1944, Dechaineux was given command of the [[heavy cruiser]] [[HMAS Australia (1927)|HMAS ''Australia'']], the flagship of both the RAN and Task Force 74, under the overall force commander Commodore [[John Augustine Collins|John Collins]]. The ''Australia'' supported Allied landings at [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] in [[Dutch New Guinea]] and on the islands of [[Biak]], [[Noemfoor]] and [[Morotai]].

On 21 October 1944, HMAS ''Australia'' was supporting [[Battle of Leyte|the landings in Leyte Gulf]]. Off [[Leyte (island)|Leyte Island]], gunners from HMAS ''Australia'' and [[HMAS Shropshire|HMAS ''Shropshire'']] fired at and hit a Japanese aircraft. Initially, the plane flew away from the ships, but it subsequently turned and dived into ''Australia''. The plane struck the superstructure of the ''Australia'' above the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]]. Although the 200&amp;nbsp;kg (440 pound) bomb carried by the plane failed to explode, burning fuel and debris were spewed over a large area. Dechaineux was disembowelled by shrapnel and died a few hours later. He was buried at sea that night.  Another 30 crew members died as a result of the attack; among the wounded was Commodore Collins.

The US government posthumously appointed Dechaineux an Officer of the [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name="adb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130675b.htm|title=Dechaineux, Emile Frank Verlaine (1902 - 1944) |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the Australian government announced that a new [[Collins class submarine]] would be named [[HMAS Dechaineux|HMAS ''Dechaineux'']] in his memory.&lt;ref name="adb1" /&gt; It was launched in 1998 in the presence of Dechaineux's widow, Mary Purbrick, and his son, former RAN Commodore Peter Dechaineux.

He was the son of Thomas Strange of [[Berkshire]] and studied medicine at [[Liverpool]] and [[University College London|University College]] in [[London]]. Strange came to Ontario in 1869. A long-time militia medical officer, he served as a deputy surgeon general for the Canadian militia from 1893 to 1896 and was [[coroner]] for [[York County, Ontario|York County]]. Strange was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the House of Commons in 1896. He died a year later at the age of 52.

The community of [[Strange, Ontario|Strange]] was named in his honour after he secured a post office for the community in 1880.

{{nihongo|'''Game Freak Inc.'''|株式会社ゲームフリーク|[[Kabushiki gaisha]] Gēmu Furīku|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[video game developer]], best known as the primary developer of the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series of [[role-playing video game]]s published by [[Nintendo]].

==History==
[[File:The Story of Satoshi Tajiri.webm|thumb|An animated history of how Satoshi Tajiri came to conceive ''Pokémon'']]
Predating the video game company, ''Game Freak'' was a self-published [[Video game journalism|video game magazine]] created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] and [[Ken Sugimori]] in the 1980s. Tajiri wrote and edited the text and Sugimori illustrated. Tajiri also used "Game Freak" as his pen name when he wrote as a freelance writer to publications such as ''Family Computer Magazine'' and ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]''.&lt;ref name=famimaga198901&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Family Computer Magazine|script-title=ja:ぼくたちゲーセン野郎|language=Japanese|author=[[Satoshi Tajiri]]|url=https://twitter.com/chou_nosuke/status/606052702246666241|date=1989-01-06|pages=114–115|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=famitsu198604&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Famitsu|Biweekly Famicom Journal]]|script-title=ja:ビデヲゲーム通信|language=Japanese|author=[[Satoshi Tajiri]]|url=https://twitter.com/chou_nosuke/status/612229058202505216/photo/1|date=1986-08-01|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 1989, Tajiri and Sugimori started a video game development company with the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/pokemon-creators-fanzine-fetches-high-price/ | work=Wired | first=Chris | last=Kohler | title=Pokémon Creators' Fanzine Fetches High Price | date=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COLUMN: 'Game Mag Weaseling': Just Checking In|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/04/column_game_mag_weaseling_just.php|publisher=GameSetWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/pokemon-creators-fanzine-fetches-high-price/ |title=Pokémon Creators' Fanzine Fetches High Price &amp;#124; GameLife |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gifford |first=Kevin |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/04/column_game_mag_weaseling_just.php |title=COLUMN: 'Game Mag Weaseling': Just Checking In |publisher=GameSetWatch |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Game Freak's first games was the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] action and puzzle game ''Quinty'', which was released in North America as ''[[Mendel Palace]]''.

'''HMS ''A3''''' was an {{sclass2-|A|submarine (1903)|0}} [[submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century.

==Design and description==
''A3'' was a member of the [[A-class submarine (1903)|first British class of submarines]], although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the [[lead ship]], {{HMS|A1}}. The submarine had a length of {{convert|105|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12|ft|9|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|10|ft|8|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|190|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|206|LT|t}} submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 11 [[other ranks (UK)|ratings]].&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder {{convert|450|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] [[petrol engine]] that drove one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged the propeller was driven by a {{convert|150|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7|kn}} underwater. On the surface, ''A3'' had a range of {{convert|320|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}};&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt; submerged the boat had a range of {{convert|30|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|5|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Akermann, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as doing so that they had to compensate for their weight by an equivalent weight of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''A3'' was built at [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]] and was commissioned on 13 July 1904. She was accidentally rammed while surfacing by the [[submarine tender]] {{HMS|Hazard|1894|2}} in the [[English Channel]] off the [[Isle of Wight]] on 2 February 1912 and sank with the loss of all on board.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author=Innes McCartney|title=Lost Patrols: Submarine Wrecks of the English Channel|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disasters of the Deep A Comprehensive Survey of Submarine Accidents &amp; Disasters |last=Gray |first=Edwyn |authorlink=Edwyn Gray |year=2003|publisher=Leo Cooper|isbn=0-85052-987-5 |pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck was salvaged and subsequently sunk as a gunnery target in the English Channel near [[Isle of Portland|Portland Bill]] on 12 May 1912, where she remains today.

'''Haraldr Óláfsson''' (died 1248) was a thirteenth-century [[King of Mann and the Isles]], and a member of the [[Crovan dynasty]].{{#tag:ref|Since the 1990s, academics have accorded Haraldr various patronymic names in English secondary sources: ''Arailt mac Amhlaíbh'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#M9|McLeod (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aralt mac Amlaíb Duib'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#D8|Duffy (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harald Olafsson'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#C4|Crawford (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harald Óláfsson'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#W5|Williams (1997)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Haraldr Óláfsson''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#M13|McDonald (2012)]]; [[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]]; [[#M7|McDonald (2007a)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]]; [[#B6|Bandlien (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} He was one of several sons of [[Olaf the Black|Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles]], although the identity of his mother is uncertain. When his father died in 1237, Haraldr succeeded to the kingship as a fourteen-year-old, and held the kingship for about a decade afterwards.

Early in his reign, Haraldr was forced to contend with an apparent coup perpetrated by a kinsman and perhaps an otherwise unknown younger brother. Following this, Haraldr was then ejected from Mann by envoys of his father's overlord, [[Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway]], who probably took action against Haraldr because the former had refused to render him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]]. Unable to overcome Hákon's supporters in the Isles, Haraldr eventually submitted to Hákon in Norway, and remained there for about two or three years before being restored in the Isles.

Unlike his  immediate royal predecessors, who appear to have favoured the title ''rex insularum'', Haraldr appears to have preferred ''rex mannie et insularum''. Three [[charter]]s from Haraldr's reign are known, two of which are recorded to have borne a waxen [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], depicting a galley on one side and a lion on the other. Haraldr reigned during a period of competing claims to overlordship of the Isles by the [[King of England|English]], [[King of Norway|Norwegian]], and [[King of Scotland|Scottish Crowns]]. Like his father before him, and a younger brother after him, Haraldr was [[knighted]] by [[Henry III, King of England]]. The act itself brought Haraldr closer within the orbit of the English Crown. Late in 1247, however, Haraldr returned to Norway and married Hákon's daughter, Cecilía, and thereby bound himself closer to the Norwegian Crown. Whilst attempting to return to the Isles in the autumn of 1248, the newly-wed's ship was lost at sea south of [[Shetland]] in a tidal race known as Sumburgh Roost. News of Haraldr's demise appears to have reached Mann by the spring of 1249, whereupon his younger brother, [[Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson (died 1249)|Rǫgnvaldr]], succeeded to the kingship.

Haraldr was evidently a popular and capable king who appears to have garnered much of his support from the Hebridean portion of his realm. His untimely death, however, led to the continuation of the vicious kin-strife which had wracked the Crovan dynasty during his father's [[floruit]]. The chaos brought about by Haraldr's demise appears to have contributed to the invasion of [[Argyll]], and near conquest of the Hebrides, by [[Alexander II, King of Scotland]].

==Background==

[[File:Haraldr Óláfsson (map).png|alt=Map of north-west Europe|thumb|Locations relating to Haraldr.]]

Haraldr was a son of [[Olaf the Black|Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#C7|Cochran-Yu (2015)]] p. 40; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]]; [[#P8|Power (2005)]] p. 34; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] p. 77 tab. 4.1; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 192 tab. i; [[#M12|McDonald (1997)]] p. 259 tab. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Crovan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of Haraldr's mother is less certain. Óláfr is known to have had two wives. His first marriage was to "''{{lang|la|Lauon}}''", a woman who was likely a member of [[Clann Somhairle]], possibly a daughter of either [[Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill]] or [[Domhnall mac Raghnaill]], or else a daughter of their father, [[Raghnall mac Somhairle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#C7|Cochran-Yu (2015)]] p. 36; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 27 tab. 1, 116&amp;ndash;117; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 81&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Óláfr's second wife was Cairistíona, daughter of [[Fearchar mac an tSagairt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 27 tab. 1; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 81&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no contemporaneous source names Haraldr's mother,&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 79 n. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; the thirteenth&amp;ndash;fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'' states that Óláfr died in 1237, and specifies that Haraldr was fourteen-years-old at the time. This would place his birth in about 1222 or 1223, at about the time that Óláfr married his second wife,&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 79 n. 48, 171; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 82; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 507; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 94&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that either woman could have been Haraldr's mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[#C7|Cochran-Yu (2015)]] p. 40; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haraldr reigned during an apparent lull in an ongoing and vicious struggle over the kingship fought between two rival branches of the Crovan dynasty.&lt;ref name="McDonald pp. 87, 90"&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; This kin-strife had its origins in the late twelfth century, on the death of Haraldr's paternal grandfather, [[Guðrøðr Óláfsson|Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the king was succeeded by [[Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson]]. Although the latter was Guðrøðr Óláfsson's eldest son, and had the support of the Islesmen, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's mother was an uncanonical wife or concubine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 70&amp;ndash;71, 72&amp;ndash;73; [[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Haraldr's father, on the other hand, was the product of canonically recognised marriage, and may well have been Guðrøðr Óláfsson's chosen successor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 70&amp;ndash;72; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]]; [[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of imprisonment, Rǫgnvaldr had Óláfr marry Lauon, the sister of his own wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 78&amp;ndash;79; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]]; [[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Óláfr, however, managed to have the union nullified, and married Cairistíona.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 79; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the half-brothers turned to outright warfare in the 1220s, in which Rǫgnvaldr's son, [[Guðrøðr Dond]], was captured and mutilated by Óláfr.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 79&amp;ndash;80; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]]; [[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]]; [[#G3|Gade (1994)]] p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Rǫgnvaldr was slain battling Óláfr in 1229, after which the latter gained complete control of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]]; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1230s, during a period of heightened tensions between the [[Kingdom of Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish realms]], Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond temporarily shared control of the Crovan dynasty's partitioned realm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 158&amp;ndash;158; [[#M1|McNamee (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the latter was killed in 1231, Óláfr assumed control of the entire kingdom, and ruled it peacefully until his own death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M1|McNamee (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Haraldr also ruled during a period of competing claims to the overlordship of the Isles,&lt;ref name="Stringer 2004"&gt;[[#S6|Stringer (2004)]]; [[#H2|Helle (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt; a region comprising the [[Hebrides]] and [[Isle of Man|Mann]], known in the Norse world as ''{{lang|non|Suðreyjar}}'' (the "Southern Islands") due to its geographical position in relation to [[Norway]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#G2|Grohse (2013)]] pp. 257 fig. 1, 258; [[#M13|McDonald (2012)]] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reign of [[Magnús berfœttr, King of Norway]], a king who conquered [[Earldom of Orkney|Orkney]], the Isles, and possibly [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] before his death in 1103, the [[King of Norway|Norwegian Crown]] appears to have claimed ultimate authority in the Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]] p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, on several occasions during the reigns of Haraldr's royal predecessors, leading Islesmen sought recognition and protection from Norwegian monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]] pp. 106&amp;ndash;108.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruler of Norway during Haraldr's [[floruit]] was [[Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway]], a formidable ruler who spent the latter part of his reign focused on foreign policy and strengthening royal authority throughout far-flung Norse colonies such as the Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#H2|Helle (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the [[King of Scotland|Scottish Crown]], in the person of [[Alexander II, King of Scotland]], consolidated control over Scotland's western seaboard, and moved to extend Scottish influence further into the Isles.&lt;ref name="Stringer 2004"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Henry III, King of England]] also had an interest in the Isles, and worked to bring the Crovan dynasty closer under the orbit of the [[King of England|English Crown]].&lt;ref name="Barrow 1981 p. 111"&gt;[[#B4|Barrow (1981)]] p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death, Haraldr succeeded to the kingship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87, 106, 171; [[#P8|Power (2005)]] p. 46; [[#D8|Duffy (1993)]] p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the reign of his father, who temporarily ruled a partitioned kingdom, and endured years of near catastrophic kin-strife, Haraldr appears to have ruled a whole kingdom, and his kingship does not seem to have suffered from serious dynastic discord.&lt;ref name="McDonald pp. 87, 90"/&gt; Haraldr's young age at the time of his accession, and the fact that he had a potential rival in the person of Haraldr Guðrøðarson, suggests that Haraldr had been designated successor during his father's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 171&amp;ndash;172.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after his accession, the ''Chronicle of Mann'' records that he sailed into the Hebridean portion of the kingdom, and left a kinsman named Lochlann as governor on Mann. Lochlann's tenure on the island led to factional strife, and when Haraldr made his return the following spring, the chronicle states that Lochlann fled the island for [[Wales]], taking with him his [[foster-son]], Guðrøðr Óláfsson.

Later in 1238, the chronicle reveals that envoys of Hákon expelled Haraldr from Mann because the latter had refused to render [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to his overlord in Norway. Hákon's delegates in the Isles&amp;mdash;a certain Gospatric, and Giolla Críost mac Muircheartaigh&amp;mdash;are described by the chronicle to have seized control of the island, and taken tribute which was due to the Norwegian king.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] p. 51; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]] pp. 107, 108 n. 28; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87, 151; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] pp. 79&amp;ndash;80; [[#W5|Williams (1997)]] p. 260; [[#B4|Barrow (1981)]] p. 111; [[#J2|Johnsen (1969)]] pp. 26&amp;ndash;27, 26 n. 8; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 512; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; By sending such emissaries&amp;mdash;men apparently without any hereditary claim to the kingdom&amp;mdash;Hákon ignored other potential claimants, such as other members of the Crovan dynasty and members of Clann Somhairle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]] pp. 107, 108 n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Less than a decade before, Hákon had demonstrated Norwegian overlordship in a similar fashion by conferring kingship upon [[Óspakr-Hákon]] whilst ignoring other claimants.

Although Haraldr attempted to oust Hákon's representatives on several occasions, his successive invasions of Mann from the Hebrides ultimately proved unsuccessful, and the chronicle indicates that he finally journeyed to Norway to render his submission. After a stay of about two or three years in Scandinavia, the chronicle reports that Haraldr became reconciled with Hákon, who restored him to the kingship. The source reveals that the boundaries of his kingdom were carefully defined by Hákon as the islands which had been previously ruled by Haraldr's father, his uncle (Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson), and his paternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] p. 51; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#B2|Beuermann (2010)]] pp. 107&amp;ndash;108; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87, 151; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] pp. 79&amp;ndash;80; [[#J2|Johnsen (1969)]] p. 27, 27 n. 1; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 512; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 96&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian king, therefore, not only deliberately excluded the island territories ruled by Clann Somhairle, but limited the possibility of Haraldr becoming in drawn into alignment with Scottish interests like some leading members of Clann Somhairle had been.&lt;ref name="O4"/&gt; Upon his return to the Isles, the chronicle states that the Manxmen rejoiced at his arrival; and declares that he afterwards reigned quietly and peacefully, enjoying an alliance of friendship with both the English and Scottish Crowns.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W5|Williams (1997)]] p. 260; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 533; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 98&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acta and honours==

[[File:Harald Olafsson, King of Mann and the Isles (seal 03).png|alt=Illustration of a mediaeval charter and seal|thumb|upright|left|Seventeenth-century illustration of a [[royal charter|charter]] and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of Haraldr.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 128&amp;ndash;129 fig. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest member of the Crovan dynasty known to have utilised a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] is Haraldr's paternal grandfather, who attached such a device to a confirmation charter granted in about 1154.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 204; [[#O2|Oliver (1861)]] pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Although none of the original seals borne by the Crovan dynasty have survived, several were documented by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century [[antiquarian]]s. In regards to Haraldr himself, one such antiquarian named [[Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton|Christopher Hatton]] not only transcribed two of Haraldr's charters, but made drawings of the seals which were attached to them. The devices themselves were in poor condition by Hatton's time, as his illustrations show portions of them broken away. It is clear, however, that the seals bore a lion on one side, and a [[clinker-built]] galley with sails furled on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 55&amp;ndash;56, 204&amp;ndash;205; [[#R3|Rixson (1982)]] pp. 127&amp;ndash;128.&lt;/ref&gt; About a century later, the charters and seals, along with other priceless documents of the [[Cottonian Library]], were destroyed by fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 55&amp;ndash;56, 162, 204&amp;ndash;205; [[#C5|''Cotton Manuscripts'' (n.d.)]] p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Waxen seals affixed to acta not only served to authenticate the written documents, but also physically symbolise the authority and significance of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Hákon formally confirmed the kingship of [[Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles]], Haraldr's younger brother and eventual royal successor, the Norwegian king is said by the ''Chronicle of Mann'' to have done so "by the protection of his seal".&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 99, 152; [[#R3|Rixson (1982)]] p. 127; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 578; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 108&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt; To the kings of the Crovan dynasty, whose military strength laid in the power of armed galley-fleets, the symbol of such a vessel upon their seals represented the strength and authority they held in the Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 204&amp;ndash;206; [[#R3|Rixson (1982)]] p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Haraldr's charters to which a seal was attached was a grant to the monks of [[Furness Abbey]] concerning mining rights on Mann, the use of a depot at "''{{lang|la|Bakenaldwath}}''" (probably [[Ronaldsway]]), and the freedom from tolls and customs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#M7|McDonald (2007a)]] p. 49; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 45, 193, 195, 219; [[#O2|Oliver (1861)]] pp. 79&amp;ndash;81; [[#P2|''PoMS, H1/17/3'' (n.d.)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The record of this document is the earliest evidence for mineral exploitation on the island, an industry that expanded throughout the island by the century's end.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In another charter, Haraldr pledged the protection of the abbey's ships and goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 195; [[#O2|Oliver (1861)]] pp. 77&amp;ndash;78; [[#P4|''PoMS, H1/17/1'' (n.d.)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His amiable interactions with the English abbey contrasted the apparent aggression of his father, who was warned by the English king not to harm the monks or their property.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 194&amp;ndash;195.&lt;/ref&gt; In a further charter, evidenced from a sixteenth-century copy, Haraldr confirmed his father's earlier grant of the lands of "''{{lang|la|Balhamer}}''" (probably Ballaharry), and the churches of St Ninian of "''{{lang|la|Ballacgniba}}''" and St Runius (all located in the [[List of parishes of the Isle of Man|Manx parish]] of [[Marown]]), to [[Whithorn Priory]] in [[Galloway]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#N1|Neville; Simpson (2012)]] p. 198 § 171; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 195&amp;ndash;196; [[#M8|Megaw (1950)]] p. 176; [[#P7|''PoMS, H1/17/2'' (n.d.)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of the twenty royal charters known to have been issued by the Crovan dynasty, only three can be assigned to Haraldr's reign.&lt;ref name="M4"&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|One of the total twenty cannot be assigned to any particular ruler.&lt;ref name="M4"/&gt;|group=note}}

Like his father before him, and his brother Magnús after him, Haraldr was [[knighted]] by Henry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 215, 216&amp;ndash;217.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle claims that the event took place in 1247, and elaborates that Haraldr returned home with "much honour, and great gifts".&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 215; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 84; [[#J2|Johnsen (1969)]] p. 27, 27 n. 2; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 542; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 98&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary English administrative records, however, reveal that the deed took place early in 1246. Specifically, a letter of safe-conduct, issued by the English king on 9 January 1246, orders that Haraldr was to be given safe-passage through England until [[Pentecost]] (27 May 1246).&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 215; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 84; [[#J2|Johnsen (1969)]] p. 27, 27 n. 2; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 542 n. 3; [[#C1|''Calendar of the Patent Rolls...''

The style apparently preferred by Haraldr's father was ''{{lang|la|rex insularum}}''.

In the autumn of 1247, Haraldr again voyaged to Norway, as evidenced by the ''Chronicle of Mann'' and the thirteenth-century ''[[Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar]]''.

Whilst Haraldr was still in Norway, the saga states that two leading members of Clann Somhairle arrived at Hákon's court, with each seeking the kingship of the Isles: [[Eóghan of Argyll|Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 83; [[#P8|Power (2005)]] p. 46; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] p. 80; [[#S3|Sellar (2004)]]; [[#M9|McLeod (2002)]] p. 30; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] pp. 203&amp;ndash;204, 206; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 547&amp;ndash;548; [[#D3|Dasent (1894)]] pp. 264&amp;ndash;266 (§ 259); [[#V2|Vigfusson (1887)]] pp. 254&amp;ndash;255 (§ 259).&lt;/ref&gt; Although 1247 was also the year of Hákon's royal coronation, and it is possible that the arrival of the Clann Somhairle dynasts was a result of the reimposition of Norwegian overlordship (as appears to have been the case with Haraldr), there may have been other reasons for the arrival of Eóghan and Dubhghall.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 1247 was also the year that a prominent member of Clann Somhairle, called "Mac Somhairle" in [[Irish annals|Irish sources]], was slain in Ireland battling the English.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]]; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Various Irish sources style Mac Somhairle ''{{lang|ghc|rí Airer Goidel}}'' and ''{{lang|ghc|tigerna Airer Goidel}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 165; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of this Clann Somhairle dynast is uncertain, although he is most likely to have been Dubhghall's father, Ruaidhrí.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] pp. 80, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} The knighting of Haraldr the year previous may well have entailed some act of submission to the Henry,&lt;ref name="O4;D7-5152;W1-8384"&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] pp. 51&amp;ndash;52; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that Hákon had consequently recognised Mac Somhairle's kingship in the Isles in response to Haraldr's acceptance of English overtures.&lt;ref name="W1-8384"&gt;[[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; An alliance with a ruler of the Isles would have certainly benefited Henry's ongoing military operations in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] p. 56; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that it was such a pact that had prompted Mac Somhairle's involvement against the English.&lt;ref name="W1-8384"/&gt; Haraldr's subsequent marriage to Cecilía, therefore, may have been a successful attempt by Hákon to lure Haraldr back to his side.&lt;ref name="O4;D7-5152;W1-8384"/&gt;

Haraldr is said to have drowned nearby in [[Sumburgh Roost]], a dangerous [[tidal race]] called ''{{lang|non|Dynröst}}'' by ''Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar'', now known to Shetlanders as Da Roost.]]

In 1248, the ''Chronicle of Mann'', ''Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar'', and the Icelandic annals indicate that Haraldr and Cecilía drowned whilst voyaging from Norway to the Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2015)]]; [[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] p. 52; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#M13|McDonald (2012)]] pp. 143&amp;ndash;144; [[#W6|Wærdahl (2011)]] p. 49; [[#T1|Thomson (2008)]] p. 140; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 52, 87&amp;ndash;88; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] p. 84; [[#P8|Power (2005)]] p. 46; [[#W5|Williams (1997)]] p. 118; [[#S5|Storm (1977)]] p. 132; [[#D9|Duncan; Brown (1956–1957)]] p. 207; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 449&amp;ndash;550, 550 nn. 1&amp;ndash;3, 551; [[#V3|Vigfusson (1878)]] p. 374; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the wreckage of their vessel washed ashore from the south, the saga specifically states that the ship was thought to have been lost south of [[Shetland]] in ''{{lang|non|Dynröst}}'', a treacherous [[tidal race]] otherwise known in more modern times as [[Sumburgh Roost]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#M13|McDonald (2012)]] pp. 143&amp;ndash;144; [[#W7|Waugh, D (2009)]] p. 112; [[#C2|Crawford (1997)]] pp. 19&amp;ndash;20; [[#B4|Barrow (1981)]] p. 111; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 449&amp;ndash;550, 550 nn. 1&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; and Da Roost,&lt;ref&gt;[[#W3|Waugh, DJ (2001)]] p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; lying between [[Sumburgh Head]] and [[Fair Isle]] ({{gbmapping|HU405070}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#C2|Crawford (1997)]] pp. 19&amp;ndash;20; 20 fig. 7; [[#M10|Martin; Wignall (1975)]] p. 156; [[#U1|''Unknown: Sumburgh Head'' (n.d.)]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A nineteenth-century account of this perilous passage runs as follows: "There appears to be a strong [[Ocean current|current]] setting to the eastward in the sea between [[Orkney]] and Shetland, and in shaping a course from the main land of Scotland to Shetland some allowance ought to be made for this. Indeed, probably the best method of making the passage would he to keep the Orcadian land aboard till you reach the [[Start Point, Sanday|Start Point]] at the extremity of that Archipelago, and from thence steer a course for Sumburgh Head, keeping to the westward of the Fair Isle. The only thing to be avoided in taking this plan, is getting involved in the furious tide race, known as Sumburgh Roost: this, as we found, extends some miles to the south of the Shetland Islands, and in rough weather the sea is frightful, even in calm weather the danger is considerable, and there are instances narrated of vessels which have been {{sic|dis|masted}} in the swell, and kept vibrating backwards and forwards in these seething tides for weeks at a time. In passing the Roost you should either keep a good offing or steer close to the shore: the latter being I believe the surest method of avoiding the heavy {{sic|over|falls}}".&lt;ref&gt;[[#J1|JAL (1858)]] p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Amongst those drowned was [[Laurence, Archdeacon of Mann]], a man who had recently been elected [[Bishop of the Isles]] by the chapter of Mann. Although Laurence had presented himself in Norway to Haraldr and [[Sigurðr tapsi Indriðason|Sigurðr tapsi Indriðason, Archbishop of Niðaróss]], the chronicle reveals that Haraldr had postponed his consecration until the former could be publicly elected in the Isles before king, clergy, and people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#W2|Woolf (2003)]] p. 178; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 546&amp;ndash;547; [[#D4|Dowden (1912)]] p. 278; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haraldr's death led to what was the final stage of inter-dynastic strife amongst his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87&amp;ndash;88, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; News of Haraldr and Cecilía's death does not appear to have reached Mann until the spring of 1249.&lt;ref name="O4"/&gt; According to the chronicle, Haraldr's younger brother, Rǫgnvaldr, succeeded to the kingship on 6 May 1249, only to be slain on 30 May by a man who appears to have been an accomplice of Rǫgnvaldr and Haraldr's cousin, Haraldr Guðrøðarson. With Rǫgnvaldr out of the way, Haraldr Guðrøðarson successfully seized the throne, and replaced Haraldr's former supporters with proponents of his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] pp. 87&amp;ndash;88, 96; [[#W5|Williams (1997)]] p. 260; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 550, 553&amp;ndash;554; 557&amp;ndash;558; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 100&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the chronicle, one of the men who suffered under Haraldr Guðrøðarson's regime was a certain chieftain called "''{{lang|la|Dofnaldus}}''". This man is stated to have been held in high esteem by Haraldr, but held a prisoner by Haraldr Guðrøðarson.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M4|McDonald (2007b)]] p. 99; [[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 78&amp;ndash;82; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 566&amp;ndash;567; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 102&amp;ndash;105.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the identity of this man is uncertain, he could be identical to Domhnall, the eponym of [[Clann Domhnaill]]. If such an identification is correct, and if Haraldr's mother was indeed Lauon of Clann Somhairle, the captive Dofnaldus would have been a close kinsman of Haraldr (perhaps a maternal uncle or maternal grandfather). In fact, Haraldr seems to have relied upon Hebridean support as opposed to Manx support during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#W1|Woolf (2007)]] pp. 78&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the chronicle makes note of three sons of a certain Niall who supported Haraldr's cause early in his reign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 507&amp;ndash;509; [[#M11|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 94&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these men were related to a certain Domhnall mac Néill,&lt;ref name="O4"/&gt; an obscure figure who faced the brunt of a Scottish royal army in 1221. The latter's patronym suggests that he may have had Hebridean&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#O6|Oram (2005)]] pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ulster]] connections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O6|Oram (2005)]] pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The maritime disaster in which Haraldr and Cecilía lost their lives demonstrates some of the difficulties faced by the [[King of Norway|Norwegian Crown]] in maintaining control of the far-flung Norse colonies west over sea.&lt;ref name="Barrow 1981 p. 111"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The term "west over sea", used in saga-literature, denotes the relative direction of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in relation to Norway.|group=note}} Not only did the calamity deprive the Islesmen of a capable king, but cost the Norwegian Crown a closely connected advocate in the region.&lt;ref name="O4"/&gt; Upon learning of the catastrophe, Hákon quickly sent Eóghan west over sea to temporarily take up the kingship of the Isles on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] p. 52; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#S3|Sellar (2004)]]; [[#C6|Carpenter (2003)]] ch. 10; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Eóghan, however, was not only a Norwegian dependant in the Isles, but an immanent Scottish [[magnate]] on the mainland.&lt;ref name="O4;S3;C6-6"&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#S3|Sellar (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt; For several years the [[King of Scotland|Scottish Crown]] appears to have attempted to acquire the Hebrides from Norwegian overlordsip, and expand its authority in [[Argyll]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#D7|Dahlberg (2014)]] pp. 52&amp;ndash;54; [[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] p. 80; [[#C6|Carpenter (2003)]] ch. 10; [[#B4|Barrow (1981)]] p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent cooling of relations between Eóghan and Alexander,&lt;ref name="O4"/&gt; along with Haraldr's later demise,&lt;ref&gt;[[#O4|Oram (2013)]]; [[#B3|Brown (2004)]] p. 80; [[#T1|Thomson (2008)]] p. 140; [[#B4|Barrow (1981)]] p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting kin-strife concerning his succession,&lt;ref&gt;[[#B3|Brown (2004)]] p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and Eóghan's subsequent acceptance of royal powers on Hákon's behalf, could all have contributed to the massed invasion into Argyll by Scottish royal forces within the year.&lt;ref name="O4;S3;C6-6"/&gt; After Alexander demanded Eóghan renounce his allegiance to Hákon, and ordered him to hand over certain mainland and island fortresses, Eóghan apparently withdrew into the northern Hebrides.

'''Jean''', also known as the '''Vitagraph Dog''' (1902–1916), was a female collie that starred in [[silent films]]. Owned and guided by director [[Laurence Trimble]], she was the first canine to have a leading role in motion pictures. Jean was with [[Vitagraph Studios]] from 1909, and in 1913 went with Trimble to England to work with [[Florence Turner]] in her own independent film company.

==Life and career==
[[File:Jean-Vitagraph-1912.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Jean in 1912]]
Around 1908, [[Maine]] resident and writer [[Laurence Trimble]] sold an animal story to a New York [[magazine]].&lt;ref name="The Big V"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} In 1909 Trimble visited [[Vitagraph Studios]] in New York while doing research for a series of articles called "How Movies Are Made". As he chatted with the sole assistant working under [[Rollin S. Sturgeon]], head of the scenario department, he learned that a story of special interest to producer [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert E. Smith]] had been set aside because it required a dog that could act—not simply do tricks, but to behave naturally on command. Trimble scanned the script and said he could train any dog to do what was needed.&lt;ref name="Marian"/&gt;{{Rp|44}}

Trimble asked if there were any dogs around, and was told about a stray that hid in the garage and came out only to snatch scraps left by members of the crew. Trimble spent an hour coaxing the frightened dog out of hiding, and another half-hour winning his confidence. Smith was brought in and saw the dog perform the action the script required. "Your dog is wonderful," Smith told Trimble, "but he's too small"—explaining that it would be impossible to see a small dog in [[medium shot]]s, one of Vitagraph's filmmaking innovations. "Oh, he isn't my dog," Trimble replied. He told Smith that the little dog was a stray, suggested that he take him home as a pet, and said, "Tomorrow I'll bring you the right dog for the picture." The next morning he arrived with his dog, a tri-color [[Scotch Collie]] named Jean.&lt;ref name="Marian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trimble |first=Marian Blackton |editor1-last=Slide |editor1-first=Anthony |date=1985  |title=J.

[[File:Playmates.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:09|''[[c:File:Playmates.webm|Playmates]]'' (1912), a film that survives]]
"Jean was equal in popularity to Vitagraph's human stars, [[Florence Turner]] and [[Maurice Costello]]," wrote film historian [[Anthony Slide]].&lt;ref name="The Big V"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} Jean was soon starring in her own films, all directed by Trimble. One-reelers and two-reelers with titles such as ''[[Jean and the Calico Doll]]'', ''Jean and the Waif'' and ''Jean Goes Fishing'' were made by Trimble as their troupe filmed along the coastline in his native Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gallo |first=Joe |date=March 2000 |title=Flashback: New England Director Larry Trimble |url=http://www.imaginenews.com/Archive/2000/MAR_2000/Text/FEAT06.htm |magazine=Imagine Magazine |location= |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trimble became a leading director at Vitagraph, directing most of the films made by Turner and [[John Bunny]], as well as those made by Jean.&lt;ref name="The Big V"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} Actress [[Helen Hayes]] recalled in a 1931 interview with ''The New York Times'' that as an eight-year-old she had roles in two of the 1910 films. "I had long curls and they let me play the juvenile lead in two pictures in support of Jean, the collie," Hayes said.

'''Lena Baker''' (June 8, 1900 – March 5, 1945)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bishop.house.gov/media-center/congressional-record-statements/in-honor-of-lena-baker-posthumously|title=In Honor of Lena Baker (Posthumously)|date=January 3, 2011|work=Congressman Sanford Bishop|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[African American]] maid in [[Cuthbert, Georgia]] who was convicted of [[capital murder]] of her white employer, Ernest Knight. She was executed by the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Baker was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by electrocution. &lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lohr |first=Kathy |title=Ga. Woman Pardoned 60 Years After Her Execution |work=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4818124 |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The slaying and execution came during a decades-long period of state suppression of civil rights of black citizens in Georgia by the white-dominated society. It had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised blacks]] since the turn of the century, and imposed legal racial segregation and second-class status. At the time of the trial, a local newspaper reported that Baker was held as a "slave woman" by Knight, and that she shot him in self-defense during a struggle.&lt;ref name="phillips"/&gt; 

In 2005, sixty years after her execution, the state of Georgia granted Baker a full and unconditional [[pardon]]. A biography was published about Baker in 2001, and it was adapted for the feature film ''[[The Lena Baker Story]]'' (2008), chronicling the events of her life, trial, and execution.

==Early life==
Lena Baker was born June 8, 1900, to a family of [[sharecroppers]] and raised near [[Cuthbert, Georgia]]. Her family, which included three siblings, moved to the county seat when she was a child. As a youth, she and her siblings all worked as farm laborers; she chopped cotton for a farmer named J.A. Cox.&lt;ref name="crime2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Seamus |last=McGraw |title=Missing Mamma: The Lena Baker Story: The Pursuit of Justice - truTV dramatization  |work=The Crime Library |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/lena_baker/2.html |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
By the 1940s, Baker was the mother of three children and worked as a maid to support her family. In 1944, Baker started working for Ernest Knight, an older white man who had broken his leg. He owned a [[gristmill]] and, after they started a sexual relationship, he would keep her there imprisoned for days at a time in "near slavery."&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;[http://www.blackcommentator.com/40/40_guest_commentary.html Guest Commentary: Lela Bond Phillips, "The Lena Baker Story: Execution in a small town"], ''The Black Commentator,'' May 2003, accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's son and townspeople disliked their relationship, and tried to end it through threatening Baker.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; One night an argument between the two ensued, during which Knight threatened Baker with an iron bar. As she tried to escape, they struggled over his pistol and she shot and killed him. She immediately reported the incident and said she had acted in [[self-defense]].

==Trial and execution==
Lena Baker was charged with [[capital murder]] and stood trial on August 14, 1944. The trial was presided over by Judge William "Two Gun" Worrill, who kept a pair of pistols in view on his judicial bench.&lt;ref name="crime2" /&gt; 
At her trial, Baker testified that Knight forced her to go with him on that Saturday evening of April 29. The town disliked their sexual relationship and the county sheriff had warned her to stay away from Knight, or risk being sent to jail. But she was afraid of Knight's physical abuse; he had forced relations on her. His son had also beat her on another occasion, warning her to stay away from his father.&lt;ref name="phillips"/&gt; Baker said she got away from Knight that night and slept in the woods. As she returned to Cuthbert the next morning, Knight cornered her, taking her to the gristmill and locking her in. When Knight returned, Baker told him she was leaving. According to Baker, they "tussled over the pistol," after he threatened her with an iron bar.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; She immediately reported it to J.A. Cox, the county coroner who had previously employed her.

The all-white, all-male jury rejected Baker's plea of self-defense and convicted her of capital murder by the end of the first day of the trial.&lt;ref name="crime2" /&gt; This charge carried an automatic death sentence. In addition to the legal racial segregation imposed by the white-dominated Georgia legislature, it had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] since the turn of the century, which disqualified them from jury service. After Baker's court-appointed counsel, W.L. Ferguson, filed an appeal, he dropped Baker as a client.&lt;ref name="crime2" /&gt;

Governor [[Ellis Arnall]] granted Baker a 60-day reprieve so that the Board of Pardons and Parole could review the case, but in January 1945 it denied Baker clemency.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; She was transferred to [[Georgia State Prison]] at Reidsville on February 23, 1945.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lena Baker Case |work=History and Archaeology &gt;&gt; Progressive Era to World War II, 1900-1945 |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2917 |publisher=The New Georgia Encyclopedia |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=What I done, I did in self-defense, or I would have been killed myself. Where I was I could not overcome it. God has forgiven me. I have nothing against anyone. I picked cotton for Mr. Pritchett, and he has been good to me. I am ready to go. I am one in the number. I am ready to meet my God. I have a very strong conscience.|author=Baker's last words&lt;ref name="crime2" /&gt;}}

Baker was executed on March 5, 1945.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; She was buried in an unmarked grave behind Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where she had sung in the choir.

==Posthumous recognition and legacy==
In 1998, members of the congregation arranged for a simple headstone for her grave.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; That year two articles were published about her case.&lt;ref&gt;Woolner, Ann. "Condemned in a Day," ''Fulton County Daily Report,'' March 9, 1998; Woolner, Ann. "Lena Baker: Postscript," ''Fulton County Daily Report,'' March 16, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, descendants of Baker's family began to mark the anniversary of her death and Mother's Day at her graveside. That year Baker's grandnephew, Roosevelt Curry, requested an official pardon from the state, aided by the Georgia-based prison advocacy group, Prison and Jail Project. 

In 2005, the Parole Board granted Baker a full and unconditional pardon.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crime2" /&gt; Commentators have suggested that in 1945, the Board of Pardons and Parole could have lowered her charge to voluntary [[manslaughter]], which would have carried an average 15-year sentence and saved her life.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Younge |title=Pardon for maid executed in 1945 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/17/usa.garyyounge1 |work=The Guardian |date=August 17, 2005 |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Executed US maid to be pardoned |date=August 16, 2005 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4155732.stm |accessdate=August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
In 2001 Lela Bond Phillips, a professor at [[Andrew College]], published a biography, ''The Lena Baker Story'' ({{ISBN|978-1930897076}}) This was adapted as a [[The Lena Baker Story|feature film of the same name]], released in 2008.

'''Leonardo Marini''' (1509 in [[Chios]] – 11 June 1573 in [[Rome]]) was a [[theologian]] and [[Italy|Italian]] [[archbishop]] of the [[Dominican Order]] of [[Catholic Church]].

==Biography==
Born on the island of [[Chios]], in the [[Aegean Sea]], to a noble [[Genoa|Genoese]] family. He entered the [[Dominican Order]] and studied theology.

Marini failed to be bishop of [[Perugia]] when Pope Paul III died before he could elect him, but his successor, [[Pope Julius III]] appointed him the administrator of the diocese of [[Mantua]] and bishop of [[Diocese of Laodicensis in Phrygia]] (March 5, 1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09669a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Marina|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as [[papal diplomat]] to [[Emperor Charles V]], and in 1560 [[Pope Pius IV]] appointed him bishop of [[Lanciano]] (and archbishop in 1562). He was [[papal legate]] to the [[Council of Trent]]. After being transferred to [[Alba]] (1566), appointed [[apostolic visitor]] to twenty-five dioceses of Italy.

He collaborated on the formation of the [[Roman Catechism]] and was a member of the [[Roman Breviary]] reform commission (1568) and of the [[Roman Missal]] (1570). On behalf of Pius IV, he reviewed the rules and constitutions of the Clerics Regular of St. Paul ([[Barnabites]]).

'''Lev Iakovlevich Karpov''' (April 18 (30), 1879, Kiev; January 6, 1921, Moscow) was a Russian Chemist and [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary.
Karpov, the son of a sales clerk, became a member of the Communist Party in 1897. He studied chemistry at the [[Moscow Higher Technical School]] graduating in 1910&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;{{cite web|title=Karpov, Lev Iakovlevich|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Karpov,+Lev+Iakovlevich|work=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Fralex|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After moving to [[Voronezh]] he became involved with the [[Northern Russian Workers’ Union]].  In 1915 he was appointed director of Bondjuschski Sawod in [[Mendeleyevsk]] ([[Tatarstan]]), the oldest chemical factory in Russia, established in 1868, which was later renamed the [[Chemical Plant Karpov]] after him. After the [[october revolution]] he founded the Central Chemical Laboratory (now Karpow-Institute for Physical Chemistry) in Moscow in 1918 and was appointed several high-ranking positions in the soviet administration. He is buried at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. 

[[Leonid Krasin]] spoke at his funeral suggesting that science would be able to restore the dead back to life:
:''"I am certain that the time will come when science will become all- powerful, that it will be able to recreate a deceased organism. I am certain that the time will come when one will be able to use the elements of a person's life to recreate the physical person. And I am certain that when that time will come, when the liberation of mankind, using all the might of science and technology, the strength and capacity of which we cannot now imagine, will be able to resurrect great historical figures- and I am certain that when that time will come, among the great figures will be our comrade, Lev Iakovlevich."''&lt;ref name=Tumarkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tumarkin|first=Nina|title=Religion, Bolshevism, and the Origins of the Lenin Cult|journal=Russian Review|year=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=35–46|doi=10.2307/128733|jstor=128733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcus Loew''' (May 7, 1870 &amp;ndash; September 5, 1927) was an American [[business magnate]] and a pioneer of the [[motion picture]] industry who formed [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's Theatres]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio (MGM).

==Life and career==
Loew was born in New York City, into a poor [[Jew]]ish family, who had emigrated to [[New York City]] a few years previously from Austria and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Caso, Frank. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=88 "Marcus Loew."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced by circumstances to work at a very young age and had little formal education. Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the [[penny arcade]] business. Shortly after, in partnership with [[Adolph Zukor]] and others, Loew acquired a [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and [[movie theater]]s in the United States.

By 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Joseph Schenck]], and [[Nicholas Schenck]].

[[Image:1914 MarcusLoew his 42ndSt office NYC.png|thumb|left|Marcus Loew in his office, ca.1914]]
By 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the [[American Music Hall]], Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, [[Broadway Theatre (41st Street)|Broadway Theatre]] (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, [[Herald Square Theatre]], Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq. Theatre, National Theatre (149th St.), Plaza Theatre, 7th Ave. Theatre (124th St.), Shubert Theatre, Brooklyn, and the Yorkville Theatre.&lt;ref name="TheatricalGuide"&gt;Cahn-Leighton Theatrical Guide, 1913-1914&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of New York, he managed the [[Columbia Theatre (Washington, D.C.)]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Headley - ''Motion Picture Exhibition in Washington, D.C.''  1999 1476608512 p250 "... as he began to expand his movie empire. In October 1919, Loew and Walter Brownley of Washington purchased the Columbia and two buildings on 12th Street for half a million dollars. The Columbia was one of the big moneymakers among ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7369&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Theatre (Boston)]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)]].&lt;ref name="TheatricalGuide"/&gt;

Loew found himself faced with a serious dilemma: his merged companies lacked a central managerial command structure. Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co.&lt;ref&gt;Directory of directors in the city of New York, 1917-1918&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Poor's and Moody's manual, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Loew purchased [[Metro Pictures|Metro Pictures Corporation]]. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled [[Goldwyn Picture Corporation]] which at that point was controlled by theater impresario [[Lee Shubert]]. Goldwyn Pictures owned the "[[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]]" trademark and studio property in [[Culver City, California]]. But without its founder [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president [[Nicholas Schenck]] needed in New York City to help manage the large [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new [[Los Angeles]] entity.

Loew recalled meeting a film producer named [[Louis B. Mayer]] who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per-picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] executive, [[Irving Thalberg]]. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production.

Mayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key [[director (film)|director]]s such as [[Fred Niblo]] and [[John M. Stahl]], and up-and-coming actress [[Norma Shearer]], later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades.

While immediately successful, Loew didn't live  to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 57 at his country home in [[Glen Cove, New York]]. Reporting his death, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] called him "the most beloved man of all show business of all time".&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Marcus Loew Wept For|date=September 7, 1927|page=1|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety87-1927-09/Variety87-1927-09#page/n0/mode/1up|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the Maimonides Cemetery in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a grave|8126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his very significant contribution to the development of the motion picture industry, Marcus Loew has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1617 Vine Street. To this day, the Loew name is synonymous with movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sobel, The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition (Weybright &amp; Talley 1974), luca 7, Marcus Loew: An Artist in Spite of Himself {{ISBN|0-679-40064-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin George Guise''' (12 March 1780 – 23 November 1828), also later known as '''Jorge Martín Guisse''', was a British naval officer who served in [[Royal Navy]] in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.  He later served in the Chilean Navy during the [[Peruvian War of Independence]] and, as Vice-Admiral, in the Peruvian Navy in the [[Gran Colombia–Peru War]], during which he was killed.

==Biography==
He was a younger son of Sir John Guise, 1st Baronet, of [[Elmore Court]], Gloucester, and Elizabeth Wright,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Mosley |title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage |edition=107th |volume=Vol.2 |location=Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. |publisher=Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd. |year=2003 |page=1702 |url= http://www.thepeerage.com/p42825.htm#i428244 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the Royal Navy, receiving a commission as a lieutenant on 6 March 1801,&lt;ref name="DBS"&gt;{{Cite web |first=David Bonner |last=Smith |title=Commissioned Sea Officers of the Royal Navy |url= http://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_crewman&amp;id=7492 |year=2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taking part in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.&lt;ref name="markham"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.markham.edu.pe/student.cfm?p=student_houses_guise.html&amp;m=student_houses.html |title=Vice Admiral Martin Guise  |work=Markham College |year=2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the 14-gun brig {{HMS|Liberty|1779|2}} between 1811 and 1813,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Winfield |first1=Rif |title=[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]] 1714–1792 |year=2007 |publisher=Seaforth Publishing |isbn=978-1-84415-700-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which captured the American ship ''Freeman'' on 29 July 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=17318 |date=30 December 1817 |page=2683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guise was promoted to commander 29 March 1815.&lt;ref name="DBS"/&gt;

When Guise heard of the [[South American wars of independence]] he resigned from the Navy, bought his own ship, HMS {{HMS|Hecate|1809|2}}, and set sail never to return to Britain. He arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] and quickly came to an agreement with  [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] to join the Chilean Navy. Guise's role in the battles that followed was significant, in spite of frequent, bitter disagreements with Cochrane.{{refn|group=note|Cochrane is highly critical of Guise, once accusing him, along with Captains Spry and Worcester, of forming a "cabal" against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Thomas |last=Cochrane |title=Narrative of Services in the Liberation of Chili, Peru and Brazil, from Spanish and Portuguese Domination |chapter=Chapter I |location=London |publisher=James Ridgway |year=1859 |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14914  |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was his contribution to the attack on the Spanish ''[[Esmeralda (1791)|Esmeralda]]'' in [[Callao]] that made its capture possible.&lt;ref name="markham"/&gt;

After the war and in poor health, he retired to [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], [[Lima]] where he married the young [[Lima|Limenian]], Juana Valle Riestra. But his civilian life was short. When [[Gran Colombia–Peru War]] broke out in 1829, he was asked to take command of the Peruvian Navy. Appointed Vice-Admiral, his fleet captured [[Guayaquil]] but he was killed by a sniper during the battle.&lt;ref name="markham"/&gt;

His body was brought to [[Callao]] in honour and he was buried there in the clothes of a [[Franciscan]] monk. In 1926 his remains were transferred to the [[Panteón de los Próceres]].&lt;ref name="markham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hammond.swayne.com/independ.htm#Admiral%20Martin%20George%20Guise Independence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208072338/http://www.hammond.swayne.com/independ.htm#Admiral%20Martin%20George%20Guise |date=8 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the four [[House system|houses]] of [[Markham College]], Lima, is named in his honour,&lt;ref name="markham"/&gt; as is ''Liceo Naval Almirante Guise'', a school founded in 1964 for the children of Peruvian naval officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lnag.edu.pe/inf_general/res_historica.html |title=Historica |work=Liceo Naval 'Almirante Guise' |year=2012  |accessdate=11 October 2013|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mesenchymal–epithelial transition''' ('''MET''') is a reversible biological process that involves the transition from motile, multipolar or spindle-shaped [[mesenchymal cell]]s to planar arrays of polarized cells called [[epithelia]].  MET is the reverse process of [[epithelial–mesenchymal transition]] (EMT).  Unlike epithelial cells – which are stationary and characterized by an apical-basal polarity, [[tight junction]]s, and expression of cell-cell adhesion markers such as [[E-cadherin]], mesenchymal cells do not make mature cell-cell contacts, can invade through the [[extracellular matrix]], and express markers such as [[vimentin]], [[fibronectin]], [[N-cadherin]], [[Twist transcription factor|Twist]], and [[SNAI1|Snail]].&lt;ref name="pmid18343170 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baum B, Settleman J, Quinlan MP | title = Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states in development and disease | journal=Semin Cell Dev Biol | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–308 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18343170 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12189386"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thiery JP. | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in tumour progression | journal=Nat Rev Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 442–54 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12189386 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1038/nrc822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  METs occur in normal development, cancer [[metastasis]], and induced [[pluripotent stem cell]] reprogramming.
__TOC__

==In development==
During [[embryogenesis]] and early development, cells switch back and forth between different cellular phenotypes via MET and its reverse process, [[epithelial–mesenchymal transition]] (EMT).  Developmental METs have been studied most extensively in embryogenesis during [[nephrogenesis]],&lt;ref name="pmid9124036"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Davies JA. | title = Mesenchyme to epithelium transition during development of the mammalian kidney tubule | journal=Acta Anatomica | volume = 156 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–201| year = 1996 | pmid = 9124036 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1159/000147846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs in somitogenesis,&lt;ref name="pmid15363416"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakaya Y, Kuroda S, Katagiri YT, Kaibuchi K, Takahashi Y | title = Mesenchymal-epithelial transition during somitic segmentation is regulated by differential roles of Cdc42 and Rac1 | journal=Dev Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–38 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15363416 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; cardiogenesis,&lt;ref name="pmid10645959"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakajima Y, Yamagishi T, Hokari S, Nakamura H | title = Mechanisms involved in valvuloseptal endocardial cushion formation in early cardiogenesis: roles of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) | journal=Anat Rec | volume = 258 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–27 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10645959 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(20000201)258:2&lt;119::AID-AR1&gt;3.0.CO;2-U }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hepatogenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid21347296"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Li B, Zheng YW, Sano Y, Taniguchi H | title = Evidence for mesenchymal-epithelial transition associated with mouse hepatic stem cell differentiation | journal=PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = e17092 | year = 2011 | pmid =21347296 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017092 | pmc=3037942 | editor1-last = Abdelhay | editor1-first = Eliana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the mechanism in which MET occurs during each organ morphogenesis is similar in that epithelium-associated genes are upregulated and mesenchyme-associated genes are downregulated, each process has a unique signaling pathway to induce MET and these changes in gene expression profiles.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Nephrogenesis===
One example of this, the most well described of the developmental METs, is kidney [[ontogenesis]].  The mammalian kidney is primarily formed by two early structures: the ureteric bud and the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which form the collecting duct and nephrons respectively (see [[kidney development]] for more details).  During kidney ontogenesis, a reciprocal induction of the ureteric bud epithelium and nephrogenic mesenchyme occurs.  As the ureteric bud grows out of the Wolffian duct, the nephrogenic mesenchyme induces the ureteric bud to branch.  Concurrently, the ureteric bud induces the nephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around the bud and undergo MET to form the renal epithelium, which ultimately forms the nephron.&lt;ref name="pmid8395349"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreidberg JA, Sariola H, Loring JM, Maeda M, Pelletier J, Housman D, Jaenisch R | title = WT-1 is required for early kidney development | journal=Cell | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 679–91 | year = 1993 | pmid =8395349 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90515-R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Growth factors, integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and protooncogenes, such as ''c-ret'', ''c-ros'', and ''c-met'', mediate the reciprocal induction in metanephrons and consequent MET.&lt;ref name="pmid10508232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horster MF, Braun GS, Huber SM | title = Embryonic Renal Epithelia: Induction, Nephrogenesis, and Cell Differentiation | journal=Physiol Rev | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 1157–91| year = 1999 | pmid = 10508232 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somitogenesis===
Another example of developmental MET occurs during [[somitogenesis]].  Vertebrate somites, the precursors of axial bones and trunk skeletal muscles, are formed by the maturation of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  The PSM, which is composed of mesenchymal cells, undergoes segmentation by delineating somite boundaries (see [[somitogenesis]] for more details).  Each somite is encapsulated by an epithelium, formerly mesenchymal cells that had undergone MET.  Two [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho family GTPases]] – [[Cdc42]] and [[Rac1]] – as well as the transcription factor [[Paraxis]] are required for chick somitic MET.&lt;ref name="pmid15363416"/&gt;

==In cancer==
While relatively little is known about the role MET plays in cancer when compared to the extensive studies of EMT in tumor metastasis, MET is believed to participate in the establishment and stabilization of distant metastases by allowing cancerous cells to regain epithelial properties and integrate into distant organs.&lt;ref name="pmid18539112"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Weinberg RA | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis | journal=Dev Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 818–26| year = 2008| pmid = 18539112 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2008.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate MET as one of many potential therapeutic targets in the prevention of metastases.&lt;ref name=Patt2016&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/aad3680 Activation of PKA leads to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and loss of tumor-initiating ability. March 2016.] doi=10.1126/science.aad3680&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to preventing metastasis is known as differentiation-based therapy or [[differentiation therapy]].

==In iPS  cell reprogramming==
A number of different cellular processes must take place in order for somatic cells to undergo reprogramming into [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS cells).  iPS cell reprogramming, also known as somatic cell reprogramming, can be achieved by ectopic expression of Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc (OKSM).&lt;ref name="pmid16904174"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal=Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 652–5| year = 2006| pmid = 16904174| url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon induction, mouse fibroblasts must undergo MET to successfully begin the initiation phase of reprogramming.  Epithelial-associated genes such as E-cadherin/Cdh1, Cldns −3, −4, −7, −11, Occludin (Ocln), Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Epcam), and Crumbs homolog 3 (Crb3), were all upregulated before [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], a key transcription factor in maintaining pluripotency, was turned on.  Additionally, mesenchymal-associated genes such as Snail, Slug, Zeb −1, −2, and N-cadherin were downregulated within the first 5 days post-OKSM induction.&lt;ref name="pmid20621051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samavarchi-Tehrani P, Golipour A, David L, Sung HK, Beyer TA, Datti A, Woltjen K, Nagy A, Wrana JL | title = Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming | journal=Cell Stem Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–77 | year = 2010| pmid = 20621051| url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addition of exogenous TGF-β1, which blocks MET, decreased iPS reprogramming efficiency significantly.&lt;ref name="pmid20621050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li R, Liang J, Ni S, Zhou T, Qing X, Li H, He W, Chen J, Li F, Zhuang Q, Qin B, Xu J, Li W, Yang J, Gan Y, Qin D, Feng S, Song H, Yang D, Zhang B, Zeng L, Lai L, Esteban MA, Pei D | title = A mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition initiates and is required for the nuclear reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts | journal=Cell Stem Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–63 | year = 2010| pmid = 20621050 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings are all consistent with previous observations that [[embryonic stem cell]]s resemble epithelial cells and express E-cadherin.&lt;ref name="pmid18343170 "/&gt;

Recent studies have suggested that ectopic expression of Klf4 in iPS cell reprogramming may be specifically responsible for inducing E-cadherin expression by binding to promoter regions and the first intron of ''CDH1'' (the gene encoding for E-cadherin).&lt;ref name="pmid20621050"/&gt;

J Mikola, Oecologia, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;) is a feeding behavior consisting of eating [[microbe]]s, especially [[bacteria]], and practiced by animals of the [[mesofauna]], [[microfauna]] and [[meiofauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Rates of metazoan meiofaunal microbivory: a review. PA Montagna, Vie et Milieu, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Energetics of detritivory and microbivory in soil in theory and practice.

PA Montagna, Handbook of methods in aquatic microbial ecology …, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In food webs of [[ecosystem]]s, microbivores can be distinguished from [[detritivore]]s, generally thought playing the roles of decomposers, as they don't consume decaying dead matter but only living microorganisms.

Microbivorous animals include some soil [[nematode]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Life cycle of the microbivorous Antarctic Dry Valley nematode Scottnema lindsayae (Timm 1971). A Overhoff, DW Freckman, RA Virginia - Polar Biology, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Organic and inorganic nitrogenous losses by microbivorous nematodes in soil.

MC Savin, JH Görres, DA Neher, JA Amador - Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[springtail]]s or [[fly|flies]] such as ''[[Drosophila sharpi]]''.

A well known example of microbivorous nematodes is the model roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' which is maintained in culture in labs on agar plates, fed with the 'OP50' ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strain of bacteria.

== Use of term in robotics ==
There is also an use of the term 'microbivore' to qualify the concept of [[robot]]s autonomously finding their energy in the production of bacteria. [[Robert Freitas]] has also proposed microbivore robots that would attack pathogens in the manner of white blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MindRDR''' is a [[Google Glass]] app created by [[This Place (agency)|This Place]], a [[London]], [[Seattle]] and [[Tokyo]] based user experience agency. MindRDR connects a [[Neurosky]] MindWave Mobile portable [[EEG]] monitor to Google Glass and uses the EEG signal to control functionality on Google Glass. MindRDR is the first app to use a [[brain computer interface]] with Google Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2687205/Google-Glass-app-gives-users-TELEKINETIC-powers-Software-lets-photos-share-online-power-thought.html|title=Take photos with your MIND: Google Glass gains telekinetic abilities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MindRDR app can use the EEG signals to take a photo using the Google Glass camera, and then can share the picture to [[Twitter]] or [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10958566/Google-Glass-gets-mind-control-app.html|title=Google Glass app gives users 'telekinetic' powers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MindWave EEG sensor measures brainwaves and the MindRDR app interprets these brain waves as an input signal for activation of hardware on Google Glass; with high levels of concentration being used as a positive user gesture, and relaxation as a negative user gesture.

== User interface ==

Within the app, users are presented with a live feed if the viewfinder with a [[Graphical user interface|graphical]] overlay - a vertical line with a scale at the side and options to exit the app or take a photo at the top and bottom. The vertical line moves up and down the screen dependent on the signal from the EEG monitor, with higher levels of [[neural oscillation|brain waves]] associated with [[Beta wave|concentration]] moving the bar towards the top, and higher levels of brain waves associated with [[Alpha wave|relaxation]] moving the bar towards the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/smart-glasses/1400569/the-truth-about-google-glass-mind-control|title=The truth about Google Glass mind control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once concentration levels get high enough, the camera captures a picture and the image remains on screen with the bar moving to allow the user to share to Twitter with a positive response, or discard the photo with a negative response.

== Possible uses ==

The creators of MindRDR suggest that this tool could be used to help people with severe physical disabilities, such as [[locked-in syndrome]] and [[quadriplegia]] interact with the digital world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/22687/google-glass-mindrdr-app-does-it-work|title=Google Glass MindRDR app: Does it work?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there has been no research published as yet to show its efficacy.

== Technical background ==
{{main|Electroencephalography}}
[[File:NeuroSky MindWaveDiagram Low.jpg|thumb|right | Diagram of a basic NeuroSky headset.]]
The human [[brain]] is made up of billions of interconnected [[neurons]]; the patterns of interaction between these neurons are represented as thoughts and emotional states.  Every interaction between neurons creates a minuscule electrical discharge; alone these charges are impossible to measure from outside the skull.  However, the activity created by hundreds of thousands concurrent discharges aggregates into waves which can be measured.

Different brain states are the result of different patterns of neural interaction.  These patterns lead to waves characterized by different amplitudes and frequencies; for example waves between 12 and 30 hertz, Beta Waves, are associated with concentration while waves between 8 and 12 hertz, Alpha Waves,  are associated with relaxation and a state of mental calm. (The contraction of muscles is also associated with unique wave patterns, isolating these patterns is how some NeuroSky devices detect blinks.)

All electrical activity produces these waves (even light bulbs), thus all electrical devices create some level of ambient “noise”; this “noise” interferes with the waves emanating from the brain, this is why most EEG devices will pick up readings even if they are not on a person's head. Measuring mental activity through these waves is like trying to eavesdrop on a conversation at a loud concert. In the past, EEG devices circumvented this problem by measuring these signals in environments where electrical activity is strictly controlled and increasing the signal strength of the data coming from the brain through the application of a conductive solution.  [[File:NeuroSky Blink3 Thumb.jpg|thumb|left | Raw Brainwaves and Power Spectrum]] However, most people don’t have rooms in their house devoid of electronic devices nor do they want to apply a conductive liquid to their head every time they use a BCI device. NeuroSky has developed complex [[algorithm]]s built into their products which filter out this “noise”.&lt;ref name='eightyone'/&gt; NeuroSky's white paper claims the ThinkGear technology has been tested at 96% as accurate as that within research grade EEGs.&lt;ref name="eightyseven"/&gt;&lt;ref name='nintysixprecent'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ballantinesbiz.com/NeuroSky/NeuroSky_David_080410.html |title= NeuroSky's Brain Computer Interface - Bridging the Gap Between Research, Academia, and the Consumer |accessdate=2010-07-31 |work= Ballantinesbiz.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeuroSky is also selling non-contact sensors to research institutions.  These are dry [[electrodes]] that can measure brainwaves millimeters from the scalp and thus can easily be worn over hair.&lt;ref name='mindcap'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.neurosky.com/Documents/Document.pdf?DocumentID=20214030-b4ec-424e-9948-7633ca602743 |title= A user-friendly SSVEP-based brain–computer interface using a time-domain classifier |accessdate=2010-07-31 |last= Luo |first= An|work= J.

== Neurosky Partnerships ==

While NeuroSky produces its own direct to consumer products, it is primarily a chip developer and manufacturer.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  NeuroSky assists other companies in incorporating BCI technology into their products and supplies them with the specialized hardware required to do so. Because of this, who NeuroSky partners with and has partnered with shapes the public's adoption of BCI technology.

'''US [[Archery]] team:''' The first use of NeuroSky's technology was by the USA Olympic Archery team to improve their game.  The coaches and archers testimony to the effectiveness of NeuroSky technology as a training tool played a large part in spurring the future development of early NeuroSky tech.
It was found that elite archers had a state of both mental calm and concentration when they released while mid-level archers lacked a state of mental calm yet had a high concentration.&lt;ref name='five'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/peripherals/2010/08/11/control-your-pc-with-your-mind/2|title= The many uses of mind control |accessdate=2010-07-31 |date=2010-08-11|last=Gee|first=Alastair|work=Bit-Tech.net|publisher=Bit-Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='games paper'&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187595210900010X  |title= Turning shortcomings into challenges: Brain–computer interfaces for games |accessdate=2010-07-31 |last= Nijholt Anton |first= Anton |work= Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment  |publisher= Entertainment Computing |doi=10.1016/j.entcom.2009.09.007 |volume=1 |pages=85–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding allowed coaches like [[Kisik Lee]], Guy Krueger, and Mel Nichols to train mid-level archers to reach that mind state (of being able to concentrate on what they need to do while staying relaxed).&lt;ref name=' three '/&gt;&lt;ref name="five"/&gt;&lt;ref name='twentynine'&gt;{{cite news|url= http://cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2010/02/04/sr.baldwin.mind.control.cnn|title= How the mind can move objects |accessdate=2010-07-31 |date=2010-02-05|work=The Situation Room|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NeuroSky has hinted on numerous occasions that it is either producing or interested in producing publicly available products that allow one to train in a similar way for other sports, with golf mentioned specifically.&lt;ref name='twentythree'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFX5erlEyE4|title= NeuroSky - Games for Health |accessdate=2010-07-31 |date=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife's name was Hera Lani [[Tuladhar]].

Nhuchhe Ratna had been an anti-Rana activist for a long time, and was a dedicated participant in the revolution that erupted in 1950. In the winter of that year, the decade-old movement to end the rule of the hereditary Rana prime ministers spread to various towns across [[Nepal]]. Protests were held frequently. On 25 December 1950, a massive demonstration was brought out in Kathmandu. The police tried to break up the march by beating up the protesters with batons. Nhuchhe Ratna was in the procession and was severely thrashed by the police. He died the same night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shrestha |first1=D.B. | last2=Singh |first2=C.B. | last3=Singh |first3=C.E. |year= | title= The history of ancient and medieval Nepal in a nutshell: With some comparative traces of foreign history, Volume 2 |edition= |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=QL0cUsHPEorRrQe2tYDwBg&amp;id=ZrcLAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=nhuchhe |accessdate=28 August 2013 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first= Shiva Bahadur | year=2008 | title= Nepal, Struggle for Democracy |publisher= Adhyayan Publishers And Distributors |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=tsQcUvavOoeErAfhx4DIAg&amp;id=rlRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=nhuchhe |accessdate=28 August 2013 |page=47|isbn=9788184350289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was held the next day, with a throng of marchers joining the procession from his home at Asan to the [[cremation ground]] at Karnadeep on the banks of the [[Bishnumati River]]. After the funeral, the accompanying crowd stoned and set on fire an army lorry.

The Rana oligarchy ruled Nepal from 1846 until 1951. During this time, the [[Shah dynasty|Shah king]] was reduced to a figurehead and the prime minister and other government positions were hereditary. [[Jang Bahadur Rana]] established the Rana dynasty in 1846 by masterminding the [[Kot massacre]] in which about 40 members of the nobility including the prime minister and a relative of the king were murdered. The massacre took place at the armory at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]]. Jung Bahadur declared himself prime minister and assumed all powers after that.

'''North Shore Hospital''' is a large [[public hospital]] in [[Takapuna]], New Zealand, serving the northern part of [[Auckland]]. Located on Shakespeare Road near [[Lake Pupuke]], it is administered by the Waitemata [[District Health Board]], which provides health services to approximately 600,000 residents of the North Shore, Waitakere and Rodney districts of Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/my-dhb/waitemata-dhb|title=Waitemata DHB - Ministry of Health NZ |accessdate=7 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency Department]] staff at North Shore see more than 60,000 cases each year.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Facilities==
The hospital provides up to 600 [[surgery|surgical]] and general medical treatment beds. It has twelve  [[operating theatre]]s (one specialised in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] care), an emergency department, a 50-bed Assessment and Diagnostic Unit, an [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care]] centre, an Elective Surgery Centre and a [[Cardiology|coronary care]], as well as a [[maternity]] and [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|special care baby unit]].&lt;ref name="NSH"/&gt;

The hospital also provides [[endoscope|endoscopy]], [[radiology]], [[pathology]], [[anaesthetic]], [[gynecological]], general surgery, a cardiac catheter lab and [[mental health]] services through the onsite Marinoto and He Puna Waiora units. Visiting specialists cover a number of further medical sub-disciplines. Two of the wards specialise in assessment, treatment and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of [[Old age|older patients]] over 65 years of age.&lt;ref name="NSH"&gt;[http://www.healthpoint.co.nz/default,51123.sm North Shore Hospital] (database entry on healthpoint.co.nz website. Accessed 2008-06-21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and staffing==
In 2007, North Shore Hospital repeatedly reported 100% occupancy rates and difficulties in finding enough staff. This is alleged to be partly due to North Shore City's affluence, with the catchment area having some of the highest average incomes in New Zealand, as well as scoring high on other social indicators. As the District Health Board funding scheme distributes money based on these indicators, it has been claimed that it receives much less funding per population served than hospitals in other areas of the country.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10450352"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hospitals/news/article.cfm?c_id=500846&amp;objectid=10450352 |title=Editorial: Hospital funding not fair |date=9 July 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues with staff shortages and overcrowding, repeatedly discussed in the press during the middle of 2007, have led two North Shore [[National Party of New Zealand|National]] MPs to inquire into the issue, noting that a 'crisis of confidence' had developed, which was generating more concern from locals 'than anything else in recent times'.&lt;ref&gt;''Hospital worries'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Thursday 12 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 North Shore Hospital opened an Assessment and Diagnostic Unit (ADU) designed to improve overcrowding and patient flow through the North Shore Emergency Department, and increase inpatient bed capacity. [[Waitemata DHB]] has since made improvements against the NZ Ministry of Health's Shorter Stays in ED target.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/6771819/Hospital-bounces-back-from-troubles&lt;/ref&gt; From July to September 2009 61% of patients were admitted, discharged or transferred from an emergency department within six hours.  For the same period in 2013, 95% of patients were admitted, discharged or transferred within six hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/health-targets/how-my-dhb-performing&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15660">An '''obligate parasite''' or '''holoparasite''' is a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[organism]] that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable [[host (biology)|host]]. If an obligate parasite cannot obtain a host it will fail to [[reproduction|reproduce]]. This is opposed to a [[facultative parasite]], which can act as a parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have [[evolution|evolved]] a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts. Holoparasites and some hemiparasites are obligate.

It is advantageous for the parasite to preserve the health of their host when this is compatible with their nutritional and reproductive requirements, except when the death of the host is necessary for transmission.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"&gt;Combes, C. (1997) Fitness of Parasites: Pathology and Selection ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''27''' (1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
Obligate parasitism is exhibited in a range of organisms, with examples in [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[parasitic plant|plants]], and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"&gt;Balashov, Yu.S. (2011) Parasitism and Ecological Parasitology. ''Entomological Review'' '''91''' (9): 1216-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to complete their development without passing through at least one parasitic stage which is necessary to their life-cycle.

Whether one regards [[virus]]es as living organisms or not, they cannot reproduce except by means of resources within living cells, and accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as obligate [[intracellular parasite]]s.

Among the [[Vespidae]] family, ''[[Vespula austriaca]]'' is an example of an obligate parasite; its common host is ''[[Vespula acadica]]''.&lt;ref name= "venom"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25084514|title = Venoms of a Parasitic and Two Nonparasitic Species of Yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Schmidt|first = J.O|date = 1984|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 316–322|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Reed|first2 = H.C|last3 = Akre|first3 = R.D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the genus ''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]]'', ''[[Bombus bohemicus|B. bohemicus]]'' is an obligate parasite of  ''B. locurum'', ''B. cryptarum'', and ''B. terrestris.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Host-parasite interaction==

===Life-cycle===
[[Parasitic life cycle]]s involve the exploitation of at least one host. Parasites that infect a single species are said to have '''direct''' life-cycles.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"&gt;May, R.M. &amp; Anderson, R.M (1979) Population biology of infectious diseases. ''Nature'' '''280''': 455-461.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[hookworm]] species ''[[Necator americanus]]''. Parasites that infect more than one host are said to have a '''complex''' or '''indirect''' life-cycle.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"/&gt; For example, the [[Malaria]] plasmodium.

====Intermediate or final Host====
An '''[[Intermediate host|intermediate]]''' or '''secondary''' host is exploited by the parasite only for a short transition period. A '''final''' or '''primary''' host is exploited by the parasite and is the only location in which the parasite is able to reach maturity and if possible, reproduce sexually.
For example, ''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]'' uses [[Ramshorn snail]] as its first intermediate host, amphibians and fish as second intermediate hosts and birds as definitive hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, B. A. &amp; Johnson, PTJ. (2011) Disease and extended phenotype: Parasites control host performance and survival through induced changes in body plan. ''PLoS ONE'' '''6'''(5):1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic permanence===
Obligate parasites may not necessarily spend all of their time behaving as parasites. When a parasite is '''permanent''', a number of generations occur in or on the host of an infested individual. [[head louse|Head lice]] are an example of this. '''Temporary''' parasites are organisms whose parasitic mode of life is limited to a few or even one stage of development.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"/&gt; An example of this is the larval stage of [[harvest mite]]s, while the adult stage is non-parasitic.

===Location on host===
The parasite may live outside of the host '''[[Parasitism#types|ectoparasite]]'''; for example, a [[tick]]. Alternatively, the parasite may live within the host  '''[[Parasitism#types|endoparasite]]'''; for example, the [[Trematoda|fluke]]. 
An obligate parasite that does not live directly in or on the host, but rather acts at a distance {{ndash}} for example, a [[cuckoo]] which hatches and is raised by non-relatives {{ndash}} is known as a [[brood parasite]].

===Invasion strategies===
In order to establish infestation in a susceptible host, obligate parasites must evade defences before, during and after entry into the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2069674| year = 1991| author1 = Hall| first1 = B. F.| title = Strategies of obligate intracellular parasites for evading host defences| journal = Immunology Today| volume = 12| issue = 3| pages = A22–7| last2 = Joiner| first2 = K. A.| doi = 10.1016/S0167-5699(05)80007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the wide range of obligate parasite types, it is impossible to identify a general invasion strategy.   [[Intracellular parasite]]s use various strategies to invade cells and subvert cellular signalling pathways. Most bacteria and viruses undergo passive uptake, where they rely on the host cell for uptake. However, [[apicomplexa]]ns engage in active entry.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, L. D. (2004) Parasite invasion strategies. ''Science'' '''304'''(5668): 284-253.&lt;/ref&gt; One obligate wasp parasite,'' [[Polistes atrimandibularis]]'', infiltrates their hosts' colony by modifying their chemical signature to match that of the hosts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf43/anzf43-531.pdf|title = Polistes Wasps and Their Social Parasites: An Overview|last = Cervo|first = Rita|date = December 2006|journal = Ann. Zool. Fennici|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tricks the host wasps into thinking the parasite is one of their own.

====Evasion of host defences====
A number of [[intracellular parasite#obligate|obligate intracellular parasites]] have evolved mechanisms for evading their hosts cellular defences, including the ability to survive in distinct [[cellular compartment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackstadt, T. (1998) The diverse habitats of obligate intracellular parasites. ''Current Opinion in Microbiology'' '''1''': 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the mechanisms that hosts employ in their attempt to reduce the replication and spread of pathogens is [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). Some obligate parasites have developed ways to suppress this phenomenon, for example ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;Laliberté, J. &amp; Carruthers, V.B. (2008) Host cell manipulation by the human pathogen ''toxoplasma gondii''. ''Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences'' '''65''': 1900-1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manipulation of host behaviour==
Changes in a host’s behaviour following infection with obligate parasites are extremely common.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' ''' 5''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual behaviour observed in infected individuals is noted, and if its complexity suggests that this behaviour will benefit the transmission of the parasite, then this is said to be an example of [[adaptive behaviour|adaptive]] manipulation.&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"&gt;Hughes, D. (2013) Pathways to understanding the extended phenotype of parasites in their hosts. ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''216''': 142-147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a difficulty in demonstrating changes in behaviour are the result of a selective process favouring transmission of the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Combes, C. (1991) Ethological aspects of parasite transmission. ''The American Naturalist'' '''138''' (4): 866-880.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these changes may merely be a side-effect of infection.&lt;ref&gt;McNair D. M. &amp; Timmons E. H. 1977. Effects of ''Aspiculuris tetraptera'' and ''Syphacia obvelata'' on exploratory behaviour of an inbred mouse strain. ''Laboratory Animal Science'' '''27''':38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most behaviour changes have not been demonstrated to lead to [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] gains in either the host or the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''25''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this behaviour is the attraction of rats to cat urine after infection with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berdoy, M.F., Webster, J. P &amp; MacDonald, D. W.  (2000) Fatal Attraction in rats infected with ''Toxoplasma gondii''. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' '''267''':1591-1594.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended phenotype===

In some cases the behaviour we observe in an organism is not due to the expression of their genes, but rather to the genes of parasites infecting them. This behaviour is an [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"/&gt;

===Evolution of host behaviour manipulation===

Three main evolutionary routes have been suggested for the appearance of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. The first is a ''parasite driven'' scenario Of manipulation, while the second and third are ''host driven'' scenarios of manipulation.
#Manipulation ''sensu stricto'' (extended phenotype- abhorrent behaviour displayed by parasitised hosts results from the expression of the parasites genes) this capacity could have been the product of natural selection in an ancestral parasite with the trait.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"&gt;Adamo, S. A. (2012) The strings of the puppet master: How parasites change host behaviour in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[mafia]]-like strategy- retaliation for non-compliance (eg.[[great spotted cuckoo]] and [[magpie]]) magpies that eject the cuckoos eggs from their nest suffer a much greater rate of cuckoo predation.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"/&gt;
#The exploitation of compensatory responses induce host compensatory responses since these may at least partially match with the transmission routes of parasites. E.g. the sexually transmitted ectoparasite ''Chrysomelobia labidomerae'', parasitizing the leaf beetle host ''[[Labidomera clivicollis]]''~ infected males exhibit increased sexual behaviour and as a result enhance inter- and intra- sexual contacts (copulation and competition) which provide more opportunities for parasite transmission.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"&gt;Abbot, P. &amp; Dll, L. M. (2001). Sexually transmitted parasites and sexual selection in the milkweed leaf beetle, ''Labidomera clivicollis''. ''Oikos'' '''92''': 91-100&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been suggested that  [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]] behaviours are not adaptive, but are [[exaptation|Exaptative]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. &amp; Vrba, E.S. (1982) Exaptation: a missing term in the science form. ''Paleobiology.'' '''8''':4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; While they may have a benefit for the parasitic organism, they did not arise with the intention of this benefit.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"/&gt;

==Parasitic mimicry in brood parasites==
The [[cowbird]] and [[cuckoo]] require the nests and parental care of other [[passerines]] in order for their young to [[fledge]]. These are known as [[brood parasite]]s. The parasitic bird species mimics egg patterns and colours of the host species, which reduces egg rejection.&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M., &amp; Robinson, S.K. (1984) Population dynamics of avian brood parasitism. ''The American Naturalist'' '''126'''(4):475-494.&lt;/ref&gt; The chicks of some species are able to manipulate host behaviour by making rapid calls that mimic the sound made by up to four of the host chicks.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, R. M., &amp; Davies, N. B. (1999). How selfish is a cuckoo chick? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''58''':797-808.&lt;/ref&gt; Mimicry of the host species also occurs in the paper wasp species ''[[Polistes semenowi]]'' and ''[[Polistes sulcifer]]'' and the bumblebee species ''[[Bombus bohemicus]]'', with the parasite changing its proportions of cuticular hydrocarbons, species- and colony-specific identifying chemicals, to match that of the usurped host species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kreuter, Kirsten; Elfi Bunk (November 23, 2011). "How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction". ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''66''' (3): 475–486. doi:10.1007/s00265-011-1294-z. Retrieved 21 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, M.F., Dani, F.R., Cervo, R., Dapporto, L., Turillazzi, S. (2001). “Recognition of social parasites as nestmates: adoption of colony-specific host cuticular odours by the paper wasp parasite Polistes sulcifer”. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 268: 2253–2260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cervo, R. (2006). ''Polistes'' wasps and their social parasites: an overview. ''Ann. Zool. Fennici'', 43, 531-549.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several butterfly species will also exhibit brood parasitic behavior. An example is ''Niphanda fusca,'' a butterfly that will released cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to trick the host ant, ''C. japonicus,'' into adopting the larva as their own in their own nest. The ant will then raise the larva of the butterfly, feeding it directly from mouth-to-mouth, until it pupates.&lt;ref&gt;Masaru K Hojo, Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Toshiharu Akino, Susumu Yamaguchi, Mamiko Ozaki, Ryohei Yamaoka (2009). Chemical disguise as particular caste of host ants in the ant inquiline parasite Niphanda fusca (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae).

It is proposed that this mimicry has evolved through two processes: either as coevolutionary responses to host defences against brood parasites or modifying pre-existing host provisioning strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Langmore, N. E. &amp; Spottiswoode, C. N. (2012) Visual Trickery in avian brood parasites in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between the parasite and host young for parental resources might lead to exaggeration of the aspects of the signal that most effectively exploit host parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hauber, M. E. &amp; Kilner, R. M. (2007) Coevolution, communication and host-chick mimicry in parasitic finches: who mimics whom? ''Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''61''': 497-503.&lt;/ref&gt; The parasitic young are likely to experience stronger selection for exaggerated signals than host young, because they are unrelated to the other chicks in the nest and therefore under selection to behave more selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtensten, G. (2001). Low success of shiny cowbird chicks parasitizing rufous-bellied thrushes: chick-chick competition or parental discrimination? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''61''':401-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of obligate parasitism==
Current theory in [[evolutionary biology]] indicates that host-parasite relationships may evolve towards equilibrial states of severe disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, P.W. (1983). Host-parasite relations, vectors, and the evolution of disease severity. ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''14''':465-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  This differs from the conventional belief that [[commensalism]] is the ideal equilibrium for both the host and parasite.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"/&gt;

[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] '''Patrick Campbell''' (1779–1857) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] army officer and diplomat born in [[Duntrune Castle|Duntrune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Was Who in Egyptology… |last=Dawson |first=Warren Royal |authorlink=Warren Royal Dawson |author2=Uphill, Eric Parrington |year=1972 |publisher=[[Egypt Exploration Society]] |location=London |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-85698-031-2 |oclc=3241760 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Campbell was born into a military family. His father was Neil Campbell (1736–1791), and his two older brothers were James Campbell (1773–1799) and Neil Campbell (1776–1827), all of whom served in the military. Patrick Campbell's service started under [[Ralph Abercromby]] in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. In 1800 he became [[Brigade Major]] to the [[Royal Artillery]] in [[Gibraltar]]. In 1809, he volunteered to serve with the [[Spanish Army]] in the [[Peninsular War]], and took part in several battles, notably the [[Battle of Talavera]]. In 1811 he raised and commanded a Spanish Light Infantry Regiment, and in 1813–14 he commanded a Spanish Brigade in the field and was promoted [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and awarded the [[Order of Charles III]] as well as the [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand]]. However, he ended his military career in 1823, and entered the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]]. He was appointed Secretary of Legation in [[Colombia]] on the 29 of December in 1826, and then Agent and Consul-General in [[Egypt]] on the 7 of January in 1833. He retired on the 13 of August in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Foreign Office List and Diplomatic and Consular Year Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc9kGajk1NUC&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate=2009-07-05 |year=1857 |publisher=Harrison and Sons |location=London |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Campbell's Chamber" in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] was named in his honour by its discoverer [[Giovanni Battista Caviglia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Letters of Richard Cobden: 1815–1847 |last=Cobden |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cobden |last2=Howe |first2=Anthony |last3=Morgan |first3=Simon |last4=Bannerman |first4=Gordon |editor-last=Howe |editor-first=Anthony |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-921195-1 |oclc=155756063 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4nHiAXjtu4C&amp;pg=PA87 |accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pokémon Pikachu''', also known as {{nihongo|'''Pocket Pikachu'''|ポケットピカチュウ}} in Japan, is a series of portable ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[digital pet]]s (similar to [[Tamagotchi]]) featuring the famous yellow electric-type Pokémon, [[Pikachu]]. Released on March 27, 1998, in Japan (November 2, 1998,&lt;ref name="FilmAnc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo: Press Release|url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/110698.html|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=February 21, 2018|date=November 5, 1998|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990218041314/http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/110698.html|archivedate=February 18, 1999|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in North America), it was intended as an exercise toy and mentioned by [[Guinness World Records]] as the most popular exercise toy of its time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Gameplay==
The first release of the device is simply called "Pokémon Pikachu." A yellow unit resembling a [[Game Boy]], it features a black and white LCD screen used to display animations of Pikachu's activities. The second release, '''Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS''', is available in clear and silver casing with a color display featuring more animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/other/pokemonpikachu2gs.jsp |title=Customer Service &amp;#124; Other Systems - Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both of the Pokémon Pikachu incarnations differ slightly from more traditional portable virtual pets in that Pikachu does not need to be fed, watered, or cleaned up after. Instead, the Pokémon Pikachu unit can be strapped to a belt and used as a [[pedometer]]. With every step it counts, the Pokémon Pikachu credits its user with "watts," which are a sort of currency used to buy Pikachu presents. Twenty steps on the pedometer will reward the player with one watt. As the player grows closer to Pikachu, more activities become available. However, if neglected, Pikachu will become angry and eventually refuse to recognize the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheats.ign.com/objects/853/853386.html |title=Pokemon Pikachu 2 GS - LCD games - IGN |website=Cheats.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS features an infrared port for interacting with [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'']],  and ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'' via the Mystery Gift option, which uses the [[Game Boy Color]]'s built-in [[infrared]] communication port. This mode allows players of the Game Boy titles to trade their Pokémon Pikachu's watts for items to use in the Game Boy game. Although there is a limitation on how much the Mystery Gift mode can be used between Game Boy cartridges, Pokémon Pikachu's only limit is that of available watts. Watts can also be sent to other ''Pokémon Pikachu 2'' units.

==Other models==
''Pokémon'' and its character Pikachu are not the only media franchises that are used by this Nintendo-made device. [[Sakura Taisen]], a media franchise of [[SEGA]] and licensed by [[Red Entertainment|RED Entertainment]] released a virtual-pet with pedometer in the same style as the Pokémon Pikachu 2 called Pocket Sakura (ポケットサクラ). It was released alongside Sakura Taisen GB; they were developed by [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]]. Sega could not publish either of them because they were rivals at the time with Nintendo, so publishing was handled by [[Media Factory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jupiter.co.jp/product/game/other/pokesaku.html |title=ポケットサクラ |website=Jupiter.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Sanrio]], responsible for the [[Hello Kitty]] franchise, licensed to Nintendo the development of the Pocket Hello Kitty. This featured a similar design to the first Pokémon Pikachu, with a game based on Hello Kitty and her friends, available in a pink-colored case.

==Pokéwalker==
A device similar to the Pokémon Pikachu, called the [[Pokéwalker]], comes packaged with [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] and communicates directly with the game cards via infrared. It allows the player to transfer one Pokémon at a time from their ''HeartGold'' or ''SoulSilver''. The user is able to catch Pokémon and find items by spending watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/06/08/pokemon-gold-silver-remakes-let-you-train-pokemon-by-walking/|title=Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes let you train Pokémon by walking|last=Fletcher|first=JC|date=June 8, 2009|website=Joystiq.com|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rastafari''', sometimes termed '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] and related fields have classified it as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]]. There is no centralized authority in control of the movement and much heterogeneity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastas refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]].  Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement has survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. The majority of practitioners are of black African descent, although a minority come from other racial groups.

==Definition==

[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} a [[new social movement]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} or as a [[social movement]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=136}} The scholar of religion Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the sociologist Ernest Cashmore as a [[cult]],{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} while scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} 
Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an "authentic" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}}
Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was "emerging" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71–72}}
Many Rastas themselves, however, do not regard it as a religion, instead referring to it as a "way of life".{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92}}&lt;ref name=Glazier&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen D. Glazier|authorlink1=Stephen D. Glazier|editor1-last=Juergensmeyer|editor1-first=Mark K.|editor2-last=Roof|editor2-first=Wade Clark|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761927297|page=614|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA614&amp;dq=Rastafari+spiritual%7Creligion+%22way+of+life%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Rastafari%20spiritual%7Creligion%20%22way%20of%20life%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2017|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that—for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]—Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158–160}} 

The term "Rastafari" derives from the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie; the term "Ras" means a duke or prince, while "Tafari Makonen" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Many commentators—including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1pp=2, 103|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=152}}—refer to the movement as "Rastafarianism".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, "Rastafarianism" is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of "isms" or "ians" (which they see as a typical part of "[[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]" culture), dislike being labelled as an "ism" or "ian" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen D. Glazier]], ''Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as "insensitive".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8–9}}

Rastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}}

==Beliefs==

[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]] was established by [[Ed Forchion]]]]
Rastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as "Rastalogy".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} The scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds described Rastafari as having "a fairly cohesive worldview";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were "fluid and open to interpretation".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Because it has no systematic theology or highly developed institutions, the sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]] stated that it was "extremely difficult to generalise" about Rastas and their beliefs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=49}} Based on his research in Ghana, the scholar of religion Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of "a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''" displaying a "shifting eclecticism".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history.{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}

Emphasis is placed on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49–50, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma "is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}

Rastafari belief is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=111|2a1=Sibanda|2y=2016|2p=183}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black history and their place as God's favoured people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} They believe that the Bible was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of [[Amharic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=127}} For Rastas, the Bible is therefore viewed as the key to understanding the past and the present and for predicting the future.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} It is also regarded as a source book from which they can form their religious practices.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=127}} The Bible's final book, the [[Book of Revelation]], is widely regarded as the most important part for Rastas, having a particular significance for their situation.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=73}}

However, Rastas also believe that the true meaning of the Bible has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those who wanted to deny black Africans their history.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=74|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=64|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127}} They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=74}} They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the "book within".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}} Common texts used for this purpose include [[Leonard Howell]]'s 1935 work ''[[The Promised Key]]'', [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]]' 1924 book ''[[Holy Piby]]'', and [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] 1920s work, the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]''.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}}

===Jah Rastafari and Jesus of Nazareth===

Rastafari are [[monotheism|monotheists]], worshiping a singular God whom they call [[Jah]]. Rastas view Jah in the form of the [[Holy Trinity]] – [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The term "Jah" is a shortened version of "[[Jehovah]]", the name of God in English translations of the Old Testament.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=24|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=83}}

As well as regarding Jah as a deity, Rastas also believe that Jah is inherent within each human individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=6|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=12}} This belief is reflected in the aphorism, often cited by Rastas, that "God is man and man is God".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Due to the view that God exists within everyone, Rastas believe that all members of the religion are intrinsically connected, and thereby regard statements like "you and I" as being insignificant.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}}
As a result, Rastas speak of "knowing" Jah, rather than simply "believing" in him.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=65}} In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}}  In believing that human beings have an inner divinity within themselves, Rastas help to cultivate a bastion against the uncertainty and insecurity that exists within society and societal institutions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=12}}

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] is an important figure in Rastafari.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} However, practitioners reject the traditional depiction of Jesus present in Christianity, particularly the depiction of him as a white European, believing that this is a perversion of the truth.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=106}} They believe that Jesus was a black African and that he was a Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} Christianity is treated with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors and the oppressed cannot share the same God,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} with many Rastas taking the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually [[the Devil]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=46}} often referring to it as having perpetrated "mental enslavement".{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}} One recurring saying among Rastafari is that "The Pope is Satan".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=93}} Jesus is given particular prominence among a Rastafari denomination known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Rastas belonging to this group refer to Jesus as Yahshua and Yesus Kritos, and believe that his second coming is imminent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Accordingly, they do not share the view of other Rastas that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}}

===Haile Selassie===

From Rastafari's origins, the religion was intrinsically linked with Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, who ruled as Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974.{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=960|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} He remains the central symbolic figure in Rastafari ideology,{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=94}} and although all Rastas hold him in esteem, precise interpretations of his identity differ.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} The Makonnen dynasty, of which Haile Selassie was a member, claimed descent from the Biblical figures [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]], a belief that many Rastas share.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=44|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=960}} However, historians agree that this alleged [[Solomonic dynasty|"Solomonic" lineage]] was broken multiple times in history, and probably a 13th-century [[invented tradition]] to justify [[Yekuno Amlak]]'s new reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=Philip |date=2015 |title=Ethiopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |page=46 |isbn=9781841629223 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understandings of how Haile Selassie relates to Jesus differ among Rastas.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} Many, although not all, view the Ethiopian king as [[Second Coming]] of Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 964}} In this, Haile Selassie is also believed to be the [[messiah]] predicted in the Biblical [[Old Testament]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=15–16, 66|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=966|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=32–33}} and as the manifestation of God in human form,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} and therefore "the living God".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=65|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=264}} Some perceive him as part of a [[Trinity]], alongside God as Creator and the [[Holy Spirit]], which is sometimes referred to among Rastas as "the Breath within the temple".{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} Among those Rastas claiming a link between the two figures, some point to the belief that both Jesus and Haile Selassie were descendants from the royal line of [[David]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}}  Rastas also cite their interpretation of chapter 19 in the Book of Revelation.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} 

Other Rastas see Selassie as embodying Jesus' teachings and essence but not being the reincarnated Jesus himself.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=964}} From this perspective, Haile Selassie is perceived as a messenger or emissary of God rather than a manifestation of God himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Middleton|1y=2006|1p=159|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=34}} This attitude may be more pervasive among Rastas living in Africa itself, who are more familiar with the realities of the continent's political problems.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} Rastas holding to this view sometimes regard the deification of Haile Selassie as naïve or ignorant;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} there are various Rastas who went from believing that Haile Selassie was both God incarnate and the Second Coming of Jesus to seeing him as something distinct.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=968}}

[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by Rastas to be the reincarnation of Christ.]]
On being crowned, Haile Selassie was given the title of "King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastas use this title for Haile Selassie alongside others, such as "Almighty God", "Judge and Avenger", "King Alpha and Queen Omega", "Returned Messiah", "Elect of God", and "Elect of Himself".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=66}} Rastas also view Haile Selassie as a symbol of their positive affirmation of Africa as a source of spiritual and cultural heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}}

During the 1960s, many Jamaican Rastas professed the belief that Haile Selassie would never die.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} The 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie by the military [[Derg]] and his subsequent death in 1975 resulted in a crisis of faith for many Rastas.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=59|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=36–37}} Some practitioners left the movement altogether.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=63}} Others remained, and developed new strategies for dealing with the news. Some Rastas believed that Selassie did not really die and that claims to the contrary were Western misinformation.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37|3a1=Middleton|3y=2006|3p=158}} To bolster their argument, they pointed to the fact that no corpse had been produced; in reality, Haile Selassie's body had been buried beneath a toilet in his palace, remaining undiscovered there until 1992.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} To support their claim of his continued survival, some Rastas claimed that Selassie was now living under a new name, Abba Keddus or Abba Keddus Keddus Keddus.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah, ''Rastafari – The New Creation'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective within Rastafari acknowledged that Haile Selassie's body had perished, but claimed that his inner essence survived as a spiritual force.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=253|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=37}} A third response within the Rastafari community was that Selassie's death was inconsequential as he had only been a "personification" of Jah rather than Jah himself.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=60}}

During his life, Selassie described himself as a devout Christian.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}}
In a 1967 interview when a Canadian interviewer mentioned the Rastafari belief that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=William David|title=Dread Jesus|date=1998|publisher=SPCK Publishing|isbn=978-0281051014|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; he responded by saying: "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement".&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLeod|first1=Erin C.|title=Visions of Zion: Ethiopians and Rastafari in the Search for the Promised Land|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-1479882243|pages=70–71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yN9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22I+also+met+certain+Rastafarians.+I+told+them+clearly+that+I+am+a+man,+that+I+am+mortal,+and+that+I+will+be+replaced+by+the+oncoming+generation,+and+that+they+should+never+make+a+mistake+in+assuming+or+pretending+that+a+human+being+is+emanated+from+a+deity.#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20also%20met%20certain%20Rastafarians.%20I%20told%20them%20clearly%20that%20I%20am%20a%20man%2C%20that%20I%20am%20mortal%2C%20and%20that%20I%20will%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20oncoming%20generation%2C%20and%20that%20they%20should%20never%20make%20a%20mistake%20in%20assuming%20or%20pretending%20that%20a%20human%20being%20is%20emanated%20from%20a%20deity.&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===

[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]
According to Clarke, Rastafari is "concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica, while at the same time making a determined effort to create an identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Rastas equate blackness with the African continent and thus endorse a form of [[Pan-Africanism]].{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} Practitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]—God's chosen people in the [[Old Testament]]—and believe that black Africans or Rastas are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=129|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=17|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=111|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=38}}
Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Rastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in "Babylon", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38–40}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175–176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term "Babylon" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} In the [[New Testament]], "Babylon" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}

For Rastas, Babylon is regarded as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} Rastas regard the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term "suffering" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism "Chant down Babylon".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Practitioners are often critical of Western resource extraction from Africa, seeing it as a form of exploitation akin to the Atlantic Slave Trade.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, again regarding this as a Babylonian development.{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} Rastas often expect white-dominated society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens it is seen as confirmation of the correctness of their faith, thus strengthening their convictions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}

[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|Map of Ethiopia, the "Zion" of the Rastas]]
Rastas view "[[Zion]]" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with "Babylon", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} In doing so, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

By the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change in view was influenced by observation of the [[1983-1985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42}} The term "liberation before repatriation" began to be used within the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=33|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=172|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} Some Rastas seek to transform Western society so that they may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of "Ethiopia"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}

There is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's [[chosen people]], meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Influenced by Garvey, many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing the black African race to be superior to other racial groups.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an "implicit potential" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not "intrinsic" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European could ever be a legitimate Rasta,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} while others believe that an "African" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African "attitude" or "spirit".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}

====Salvation and paradise====

Rastafari has been characterised as a [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=7–8|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=248–249}} for it espouses the idea that the present age will come to an apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} With Babylon destroyed, Rastas believe that humanity will be ushered into a "new age".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=129}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that this would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} In this Day of Judgement, Babylon will be overthrown,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} and Rastas would be the chosen few who survive.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=134}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in Daniel 2: 31–32.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}
In Rasta belief, the end of this present age would be followed by a millennium of peace, justice, and happiness in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} The righteous will live in paradise in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} Those who had supported Babylon will be denied access to paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}}
The Rasta conception of salvation has similarities with that promoted in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}}

Rastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=76}}
Barrett observed some Jamaican Rastas who believed that those Rastas who did die had not been faithful to Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}}
In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=75}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional religion]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=73}}

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===

[[File:Rasta Man Barbados.jpg|thumb|Rastaman in [[Barbados]], wearing the Rastafari colours of green, gold, red and black on a [[rastacap]].]]
Most Rastas share a pair of fundamental moral principles known as the "two great commandments".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} These are love of God and love of neighbour.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} Rastafari promotes the idea of "living naturally",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the "natural" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and as a result have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}}

Rastafari promotes what it regards as the restoration of black manhood, believing that men in the African diaspora have been emasculated by Babylon.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=96}} Rastafari espouses [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] principles,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=13|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=241|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=95}} and promotes the idea that women should submit to male leadership.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=96}} External observers—including scholars like Cashmore and Edmonds{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=95}}—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure during their period of [[menstruation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly;{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved toward greater gender equity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the [[Book of Leviticus]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} and in the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}}

Rasta women usually wear clothing that covers their head and masks their body contours, in a manner akin to [[hijab|traditional Islamic clothing]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Long skirts are usually worn rather than trousers,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} and women are expected to cover their head while praying.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} Rasta discourse legitimises this female dress code with the claim that it is necessary to prevent women attracting men; it also endorses this female dress code as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}

[[File:Rasta Shop – Seaside, Oregon.jpg|thumb|left|Rasta Shop, Oregon]]
As it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari was not monogamous.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted to have multiple female sex partners, while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88}} although there are many Rastas who are legally married.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=78–79}} Rasta men refer to their female partners as "queens",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=109}} or "empresses",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}} while the males in these relationships are known as "kingmen".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87–88}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=103–104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at home.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Rastafari typically rejects [[feminism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=178–179|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87}} although since the 1970s there have been increasing numbers of Rasta women calling for greater gender equity within the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=107}} Clarke encountered Rasta women in Britain who expressed feminist sentiment and criticised [[sexism]] within the religion,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} while the scholar Terisa E. Turner encountered black feminists in Kenya who were appropriating Rastafari and redefining its content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}

Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=209|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas also typically express [[homophobia|hostile attitudes to homosexuality]], regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} In the 1960s, the scholar Sheila Kitzinger suggested that this horror of homosexuality "may be an indication of a heterosexuality which is not markedly pronounced" among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=35}} The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested that there were likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178–179}}

Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas do not typically vote and derogatorily dismiss politics as "politricks".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} Similarly, some Ghanaian Rastas were reported as refusing to vote in the [[Ghanaian general election, 2000|2000 general election]], believing that salvation would only come through livity, not political activity.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=164}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the political left that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=175–176, 179}} Most of these Jamaican practitioners have rejected both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] as models of economic development.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=225}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance has been involved in campaigns promoting [[social justice]], [[environmental justice]], and democratic elections.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165–167}} In the example of Grenada, many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979, although Marxist-Leninist factions later turned against them.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}

==Practices==

The cultural and religious practices of Rastafari are referred to as "livity" by Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}}
Rastafari has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}} There are individuals who are regarded as elders within the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} This is an honorific title bestowed upon those who have attained a good reputation among Rastas because of their exemplary conduct.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities among Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}

===Grounding===

[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rastas in the West African country of Liberia]]
The term "grounding" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban those who contravene the rules that they set forth.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}

One of the central activities that takes place at groundings is "[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments that are presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56–57}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} Cashmore observed that in England, Rastas arrived and left throughout the reasoning session.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=10–11}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} Barrett suggested that the most common example had "all the structure of a classical ritual prayer".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} This prayer involves supplication of God, the supplication for the hungry, sick, and infants, calls for the destruction of the Rastas' enemies, and then closes with statements of adoration.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Princes shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand unto God. Oh thou God of Ethiopia, thou God of divine majesty, thy spirit come within our hearts to dwell in the parts of righteousness. That the hungry be fed, the sick nourished, the aged protected, and the infant cared for. Teach us love and loyalty as it is in Zion.|source=— Opening passage of a common Rasta prayer{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} }}

The largest groundings were known as "groundations" or "grounations" in the 1950s, although were subsequently re-termed "Nyabinghi Issemblies".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=58–59}} The term [[Nyabinghi]] is adopted from the name of a mythical African queen.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=59}} Several dates are often selected for Nyabinghi Issemblies, particularly those associated with Ethiopia and Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} These include Ethiopian Christmas (7 January), the day on which Haile Selassie visited Jamaica (21 April), Selassie's birthday (23 July), Ethiopian New Year (11 September), Selassie's coronation day (2 November).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} Some Rastas also organise Nyabinghi Issemblies to mark Jamaica's Emancipation Day (1 August) and [[Marcus Garvey]]'s birthday (17 August).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}}

Nyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as "temples" or "tabernacles"—which are specifically constructed for the purpose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders to do so, and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=60–61}} The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} During the daytime, those Rastas attending the event engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}
Nyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They also help to confirm Rastas' convictions in the veracity of Rastafari teaching.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}

===Spiritual use of cannabis{{anchor|Cannabis}}===

{{See also|Cannabis and religion}}
[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|right|Rastafari man carrying a basket]]
Clarke stated that the "principle ritual" of Rastafari was the smoking of ganja, or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} Among the names that Rastas give to the plant are ''callie'', ''Iley'', "the herb", "the grass", and "the weed".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} When smoked in ritual contexts, Rastas often refer to it as "the holy herb".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} In addition to smoking it, Rastas also ingest cannabis in a tea, as a spice in cooking, and as an ingredient in medicine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}
Cannabis is usually smoked during groundings,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} although some Rastas smoke it almost all of the time.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} Others have criticised this practice, believing that use of the drug should be restricted to groundings.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}}
However, not all Rastas use ganja,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=53}} explaining that they have already achieved a higher level of consciousness and thus do not require it.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

Rastas argue that the use of ganja is promoted in the Bible, specifically in Genesis 1: 29, Psalms 18:8, and Revelation 22:2.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} Rastas portray cannabis as the supreme herb,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and regard it as having healing properties.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=48, 55}} They also eulogise it for inducing feelings of "peace and love" in those taking it,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows the smoker to discover their inner divinity, or "InI consciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=49, 55}} Some Rastas express the view that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts perceived immoral practices, such as same-sex sexual relations, in society.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}}

When meeting in a grounding, Rastas typically remove their head gear first.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} Rastas most often smoke cannabis through a form of large cigarette known as a [[spliff]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=130|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56}} This is often rolled together while a prayer is offered to Jah; only once this is completed is the spliff then lit, enabling it to be smoked.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} At other times, cannabis is smoked not in a spliff but in a [[bong|water pipe]] referred to as a "chalice".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} There are different styles of chalices used by Rastas, including [[kutchie]]s, [[chillum (pipe)|chillum]]s, and [[steamer (appliance)|steamer]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} The pipe is passed in a counter-clockwise direction around the assembled circle of Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}}

[[File:Cannabis Plant.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A flowering cannabis plant]]
By the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as "[[Cannabis sativa|dagga]]"&lt;ref&gt;Hamid, ''The Ganjah Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana'', introduction, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 130 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also referred to as "the healing of the nation", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', pp. 35, 85; Edmonds, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various methods of transmission that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. One possible source was the African diasporic religion of [[Kumina]], based on the practices of [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] enslaved people and [[indentured labourers]] who were brought to Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas Parish]], where a prominent early Rasta, [[Leonard Howell]], lived during the period he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}

A second possible source was the use of cannabis in various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought the use of cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} One Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} It is also possible that its adoption was also influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91–92}}

According to many Rastas, the [[Legal issues of cannabis|illegality of cannabis]] in many nations is evidence of [[persecution of Rastafari]]. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth&amp;nbsp;– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=128}}

===Music===

[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the Lion of Judah]]
Rastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} In performing it, Rastas also reaffirm their rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}

The bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}

As Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to the Rastafarians' social and political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like "Another Moses" and "Babylon Gone" reflecting this Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as "Reincarnation" and "Tribute to Marcus Garvey".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}
Rasta ideas began to feature in the lyrics of [[mento]] songs, such as [[Lord Lebby]]'s "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=115}} 

1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than had previously been present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' "[[African Herbsman]]" and "Kaya", and [[Peter Tosh]]'s "Legalize It" referenced marijuana use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' "[[Rivers of Babylon]]" and [[Junior Byles]]' "Beat Down Babylon" referenced the Rastafarian belief in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Its popularity led to the emergence of "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who adopted the cultural trappings of Rastafari—such as dreadlocks and marijuana use—without sharing the religion's beliefs.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their faith.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two have come to be widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection between them is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}

===Language and symbolism===

{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}
In the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as "dreadtalk", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}}
Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92–93}} They believe that the [[English language]] is a tool of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=46}} and thus by formulating their own language are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the English language.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} for whom—according to Barrett—Rasta rhetoric can be "meaningless babbling".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}

[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975–1987).svg|thumb|left|Garvey adopted the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for his movement; Rastas in turn adopted the tricolour]]
When greeting one another, Rastas often say "Peace and Love".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=269}} Rastas make wide use of the pronoun "I".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use "I" in place of "me", "I and I" in place of "we", "I-ceive" in place of "receive", "I-sire" in place of "desire", "I-rate" in place of "create", and "I-men" in place of "[[Amen]]".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as "InI Consciousness" or "Isciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as "Haile Selassie I", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word "downpression" in place of "oppression" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with "up" being phonetically akin to the "opp-".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour "livicate" over "dedicate" because "ded-" is phonetically akin to the word "dead".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}}

Rastafarians often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolises the blood of martyrs, the black symbolises the skin of Africans, and the green represents the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the Lion of Judah, also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}

===Diet===
{{Main|Ital}}

[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast; ackee, plantain, boiled food, breadfruit, and mango-pineapple juice]]
Rastas seek to produce food "naturally",{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} eating what they call [[ital]], or "natural" food.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=141|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} This is often produced [[Organic farming|organically]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} and locally.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} Most Rastas adhere to the [[kosher|dietary laws]] outlined in the Old Testament's [[Book of Leviticus]], and thus avoid eating pork or crustaceans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=49}} Other Rastas remain totally [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} and also avoid the addition of any additives, including sugar and salt, to their food.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=141|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} Rasta dietary practices have come under ridicule from non-Rastas; in Ghana for example, where food traditionally includes a high meat content, the Rastas' emphasis on vegetable produce has led to the humorous comment from other Ghanaians that Rastas "eat like sheep and goats".{{sfn|White|2010|p=309}} In Jamaica, Rasta practitioners have commercialised ital food, for instance by selling fruit juices prepared according to Rasta custom.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=267}}

Rastafarians typically avoid food produced by non-Rastas or from unknown sources.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=85|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=142|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=48}} Rasta men also refuse to eat food prepared by a woman while she was menstruating.{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=142}} They also avoid [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=85|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=131}} [[cigarettes]],{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=131|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} and hard drugs such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}

===Dreadlocks===

{{Main|Dreadlocks}}
[[File:Dreadlocked rasta.jpg|thumb|right|Rasta man with tuff dreads]]
Through their use of language, dress, dreaded hair, and lifestyle Rastas seek to draw a clear boundary between themselves and non-Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} One of the "distinguishing mark[s] of the movement" is the formation of hair into [[dreadlocks]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} The formation of dreadlocks is Biblically inspired, legitimised by reference to the [[Book of Numbers]] (6: 5–6).{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke|1y= 1986|1p=89|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3p=43}} They are regarded as marking a covenant that the Rastas have made with God,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} and are also regarded as a symbol of strength linked to the hair of the Biblical figure of [[Samson]].{{sfnm |1a1=Clarke|1y=1986 |1p= 90 |2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137}}  Sometimes this dreadlocked hair is then shaped and styled, often inspired by a lion's mane symbolising Haile Selassie, who is regarded as "the Conquering [[Lion of Judah]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=90 |2a1= Edmonds |2y=2012|2pp= 44, 45}} For Rastas, the wearing of dreads is a symbolic rejection of Babylon and a refusal to conform to its norms and standards regarding grooming aesthetics.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=157|2a1=Clarke |2y= 1986 |2p= 90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} They also reflect a commitment to the Rasta idea of 'naturalness'.{{sfn|Edmonds |2012 |p=44}} Rastas are often critical of black people who straighten their hair, believing that it is an attempt to imitate white European hair and thus reflects alienation from a person's African identity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 44}}

There are Rastas who do not wear their hair in dreadlocks; within the religion they are often termed "cleanface" Rastas.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=140}} Some Rastas have also joined the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Christian organisation to which Haile Selassie belonged, and these individuals are required to not wear their hair in locks by the Church.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1pp=62–63|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=53}} Many Rastas also grow their beards long.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 92}}  In reference to Rasta hairstyles, Rastas often refer to non-Rastas as "baldheads",{{sfn |Edmonds|2012|p=45}} while those who are new to Rastafari and who have only just started to grow their hair into dreads are known as "nubbies".{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p=140}} Members of the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastas conceal their dreadlocks within turbans.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |pp= 257–58}} The [[tam o' shanter (cap)|tam]] headdress worn by many Rastas is coloured green, red, black, and yellow to symbolise allegiance and identification with Ethiopia.{{sfn |Clarke |1986|p= 13}}

From the beginning of the Rastafari movement in the 1930s, adherents typically grew beards and tall hair, perhaps in imitation of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} The wearing of hair as dreadlocks then emerged as a Rasta practice in the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Within the oral culture of the movement, there are various different claims as to how this practice was adopted.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} One claim is that it was adopted in imitation of certain African nations, such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Somalis]], or [[Oromo people|Oromo]], or that it was inspired by the hairstyles worn by some of those involved in the anti-colonialist [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} An alternative explanation is that it was inspired by the hairstyles of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[sadhus]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp= 42–43}}

It has been suggested (e.g., Campbell 1985) that the first Rasta locks were copied from Kenya in 1953, when images of the independence struggle of the feared [[Mau Mau Uprising|''Mau Mau'' insurgents]], who grew their "dreaded locks" while hiding in the mountains, appeared in newsreels and other publications that reached Jamaica. However, a more recent study by Barry Chevannes&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, 1998, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; has traced the first hairlocked Rastas to a subgroup first appearing in 1949, known as Youth Black Faith.

[[File:Rastafarian Man In Rasta Cap.jpg|thumb|left|Rastafari man in rastacap]]
The wearing of dreadlocks has faced opposition from other sectors of society; in Jamaica during the mid-20th century, teachers and police officers used to cut off the dreads of Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=139}}  In the United States, several public schools and workplaces have lost lawsuits as the result of banning locks. [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights. More recently, in 2009, a group of Rastafari settled a federal lawsuit with the Grand Central Partnership in New York City, allowing them to wear their locks in neat ponytails, rather than be forced to "painfully tuck in their long hair" in their uniform caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| via = The Associated Press |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/08/2009-08-08_rastafarians_win_suit_allowing_them_to_bare_dreadlocks_at_work.html |title=Rastafarians win suit allowing them to bare dreadlocks at work | work =NY daily news |date= August 8, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreadlocks remain socially stigmatised in many societies; in Ghana for example, they are often associated with the homeless mentally ill, with such associations of marginality extending onto Ghanaian Rastas.{{sfn|White|2010|p=310}}

Dreadlocks and Rastafari-inspired clothing have also been worn for aesthetic reasons by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 90}} For instance, many reggae musicians who do not adhere to the Rastafari religion wear their hair in dreads.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p= 245}}  Many non-Rastafari of African descent wear locks as an expression of pride in their ethnic identity, or simply as a hairstyle, and take a less purist approach to developing and grooming them. The wearing of dreads also has spread among people of other ethnicities. Locks worn for stylish reasons are sometimes referred to as "bathroom locks", to distinguish them from the kind that are purely natural. Rastafari purists also sometimes refer to such dreadlocked individuals as "wolves", as in "a wolf in sheep's clothing", especially when they are seen as trouble-makers who might potentially discredit or infiltrate Rastafari.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of dreadlocks has also contributed to the negative view of Rastafari held by many non-Rastas, who regard it as wild and unattractive.{{sfn|Barrett |1997|p= ix}}

== History ==

The Rastafari movement developed out of the legacy of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], in which over ten million Africans were enslaved and transported from Africa to the Americas between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} On the island, the enslaved Africans were divided into a stratified system, with field workers on the lowest rung and house servants above them.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}} With slavery abolished, formerly enslaved Africans and Afro-Jamaicans became free peasants.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} In the three decades after emancipation, the [[Free Villages|Free Village]] system proliferated across Jamaica as non-conformist missionaries, particularly Baptist, purchased land from the large owners and sold it as smaller plots to former slaves.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=4}}

Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860–61.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans—who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions—to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}

===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===

[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Garvey, a prominent African nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]
According to the scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from "the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to "intellectual and conceptual frameworks" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain "fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} 

In the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29–34|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75–76|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54–56}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32–33}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}

Also spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, "Ethiopia" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as "Ethiopian"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34–35}}

Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41–42}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}

A rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to "look to Africa" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38–39}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was "legendary".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as "a great coward" who rules a "country where black men are chained and flogged."{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;E. David Cronon, ''Black Moses'', University of Wisconsin Press, Madison (1955), 1966, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} with many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari "emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the "most important" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}

===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930–1949===

[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|right|Selassie I in the 1930s]]
Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Christian clergymen, among them Leonard Percival Howell, Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert, Henry Archibald Dunkley, and Hinds, claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]] (5:2–5; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} Clarke stated that "to all intents and purposes this was the beginning" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}}

Over the following years, a number of street preachers—most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]—began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett |1y= 1997 |1p=81|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=9}} Howell has been described as the "First Rasta",&lt;ref&gt;''The First Rasta: Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism'', Helene Lee, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "leading figure" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke |1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85–86 |3a1= Edmonds |3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p= 25 |2a1= Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86 |4a1= Edmonds |4y= 2012|4pp=13–14}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3pp=14–15}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}

In 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p= 47|3a1= Barrett |3y= 1997 |3p= 89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the [[Book of Revelation]] (19:11–19).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 47}}

===Subsequent development: 1950–present===

Rastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}

[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]
In the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}
Backlash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became "folk devils" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28–29|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95–98|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29–30|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98–99|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19–20}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}

At the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158–160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82–83|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing_charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}

Whereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as "Uptown Rastas".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25–26}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}} 

[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta vendor in the United States, 2013]]
In the mid-1970s, the international popularity of reggae exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who—according to Cashmore—"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} The popularity of reggae led to a growth in "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but whom did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by these developments, believing that the popularity of reggae had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to break from the past and move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=105, 108–111}} Manley described Rastas as a "beautiful and remarkable people",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the "rod of correction", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=91–92|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121–122}}

Enthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and then that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastafarians in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful than Rastafari at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so—[[Judith Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]—maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29–30}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} Since the mid-1990s, however, there was a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which have attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30–31}}

==Organization==

Rastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Centralised and hierarchical structures are avoided by Rastas because they want to avoid replicating the formal structures of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52–53}} Rastas also tend to avoid hierarchic and bureaucratic structures because of the ultra-individualistic ethos that the religion promotes with its ideas about inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santeria]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to fashion a pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88–89}}

===Mansions of Rastafari===

{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}
Within Rastafari, there are distinct groups which display particular orientations.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} There are often referred to as "houses" or "mansions", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states "In my father's house are many mansions".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====House of Nyabinghi====
The House of Nyabinghi is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was a manifestation of God and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to make any compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Bob Marley whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}} According to Cashmore, the Nyabinghi House is "vehemently anti-white".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} It is probably the largest Rastafari group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====Bobo Ashanti====
The Bobo Ashanti sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/boboshanti.shtml |title=Bobo Shanti (Bobo Shanti Congress or Ethiopia Black International Congress) |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards, who served as the group's high priest, until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} Male members of the group are divided into two categories: the "priests" who conduct religious services and the "prophets" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and thus are superior to white Europeans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Bob Ashanti practitioners will often refuse to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Members of this sect are recognisable by their attire, which include long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of Bob Ashanti Rastas have lived outside the Bull Bay commune, but continue to regard the latter as a place of [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}}

====Twelve Tribes of Israel====
The Twelve Tribes of Israel sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=227|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/twelvetribes.shtml |title=Twelve Tribes of Israel |website=BBC |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded himself as the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], one of [[Jacob]]'s twelve sons, and his followers thus refer to him as "Prophet Gad", "Brother Gad", or "Gadman".{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=962|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity in its beliefs;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Barrett stated that there was "only a thin line dividing the sect from true Christianity".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=231}} Practitioners are often dubbed "Christian Rastas" because they believe Jesus is the messiah and only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which month in the [[Hebrew calendar]] they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66–67}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Some Rastas regarded the Twelve Tribes as a heretical group for its views.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} 

The Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term "middle-class Rastas" and "uptown Rastas" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961–962}}

====Church of Haile Selassie====
The Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68–69}} In [[New York (state)|New York]], the group have established prison chaplains.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

====Fulfilled Rastafari====
Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus Christ through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa—for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal—and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=— Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}

As of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}
Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}

The Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that "whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance."{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}} Benard was of the view that because of its stances on capitalism, European hegemony, and white racism, Rastafari is "easily incorporated into other nations with similar histories of European oppression".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=90}}
According to sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], Rastafari "helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In the religion's early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94–95}}

===Conversion and deconversion===

Rastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go "trodding" to meet with newly converted Rastas in order to instruct them in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On examining the Rasta movement in England during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that Rastas had not converted instantaneously to the belief system, but rather had undergone "a process of drift" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of the central importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}}
Rastas often claim that—rather than [[religious conversion|converting]] to the religion—they were actually always a Rasta and that their actual embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}}

They regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the "insight" to recognise the importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Rastas often regard themselves as being the "enlightened ones" who have "seen the light".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57–58}} English Rastas have for instance expressed criticism of black Britons who have not embraced the religion, stating that they have been "brainwashed", "misguided by European Christianity", and "blinded by Babylon".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=38}}

Some Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among the British Rastas whom he communicated with, he found that some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some of these British ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rasta belief failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to the industrialised and materialistic society in the UK.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some of British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and musical outlets insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}

===Jamaica and the Caribbean===

Barrett described Rastafari as "the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica."{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}}
As of the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of these individuals were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]] in order to "drink from the source".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}

In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified themselves as Rastafari.&lt;ref name="state2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimated that in the 2000s they formed "about 5% of the population" of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters AlertNet ([[Reuters Foundation]]):[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/countryprofiles/216645.htm?v=details Jamaica] (citing "NI World Guide 2003/2004"); ''The world guide: a view from the south'', [[New Internationalist]] Publications, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=1ETNTK_bCtTNjAevpqzXBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=qertAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rastafarians+per+cent#search_anchor p. 312] ("Rastafarians 5 per cent")&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica's Rasta population were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most Jamaican Rastas remain Afro-Jamaican, it has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2–3}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although since that point it attracted many middle-class members.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} By the 1980s, there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=241}} The majority are male.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} These Rastas are predominantly ex-Christians.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=3}}

During the 1970s, Rastafari ideas were spread through much of the eastern Caribbean through the growing popularity of reggae.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} Rasta ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views then prevailing in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} A number of Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}}

Reggae was introduced to Cuba in the 1970s by Jamaican students.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} By the 1980s, underground reggae parties were being held in Havana and Santiago.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} Foreign Rastas who were studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with this reggae scene and helped to ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}}

===Africa===

Since the founding of Rastafari, some practitioners have followed through with their belief in resettlement in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} The West African states of Ghana and Nigeria have been particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Ghana's status as the first African country to gain independence from European colonial rule (in 1957) made it an attractive place for members of the African diaspora to migrate to; its first post-independence President, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], encouraged this as part of his Pan-African ethos. Among the Caribbean immigrants to arrive in the country during the 1960s were Rastafarians, while some native Ghanaians also converting to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306–307}} When asked as to why they chose Ghana as a new home, several of the Rasta arrivals described it as the "gateway to the continent";{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} others cited its political stability and affordability as making it ideal for settlement.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=160}} For his Pan-African efforts, Nkrumah has come to be regarded as a heroic figure among many Rastas, although other Ghanaians have been critical of what they perceive as excess idolisation of the former president.{{sfn|White|2010|p=313}} The largest congregation of Ghanaian Rastas has been in southern parts of the country, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana, especially in the towns of [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] and [[Bolgatanga]].{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154–155}} Non-Ghanaian Rastas living in the country have nevertheless complained of social ostracism, unemployment, and legal prosecution for ganja possession;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=161}} Ghanaians who were not Rastas often accuse the Rastas of being "drop-outs", "too Western", and "not African enough".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161–162}}

[[File:Rasta Mural, Sheshemane (11417146756).jpg|thumb|left|Rasta mural in Ethiopia]]
In the 1960s, a Rasta community established itself in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available for members of the African diaspora by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}

By the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}}
Several Rastafari orders have also been established in Zimbabwe, all of which send representatives to the Rastafari Association of Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}}

At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}

===Western countries===

During the 1950s and 1960s, [[British African-Caribbean people|several thousand Caribbean migrants settled in the United Kingdom]], some of whom brought Rastafari with them.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} This social structure allowed for the promotion of in-gang associations and the restrictions of contacts with Babylon.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s as a result of reggae's popularity.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} In that same decade it also faced increasing opposition, being regarded as a criminal sub-culture by both much of the press,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} and by the police, resulting in complaints of police harassment.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74–75}} 

According to Clarke's research, the majority are from black working-class families who practiced Pentecostalism, although a small number are from white families.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=53–54}} Cashmore found that the majority of British Rastas were male and that most had few or no educational qualifications.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=76, 78}} He also found that around 50% of them were unemployed, and 45% employed in manual occupations; only 5% were in more skilled jobs or higher education.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=70}} In 1986, there were an estimated 5000 Rastas living in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=14}} Clarke believed that there were "probably fewer members" at this time then there had been at the start of the 1980s, with the movement declining following Marley's death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=61}} According to the [[2001 United Kingdom Census]] there are about 5000 Rastafari living in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/ataglance/glance.shtml |title=Rastafari at a glance |publisher=BBC |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke described Rastafari as a numerically small but "extremely influential" component of black British life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}}

Rastafari was also established in various continental European countries, among them the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and France, gaining a particular foothold among black migrant populations but also attracting a growing number of white converts.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=83}}
Rasta communities were also established in two French cities that had substantial black populations, [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=98}} In the Netherlands, it attracted converts within the [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Surinamese migrant community]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

Rastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} As with the case in the UK, American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded their religion as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}}

===Australasia and Asia===

Rastafari attracted membership from within the [[Māori people|Maori]] population of New Zealand,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=173|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90}} and the Aboriginal population of Australia.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

A small Rasta community developed in [[Japan]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/history.shtml |title=Religions – Rastafari: Rastafarian history |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by a practitioner named Jah Hiro.{{sfn|King|2002|p=101}}

[[File:Mn roy2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Philosopher and political activist M.N. Roy (1887–1954), author of ''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution.'']]
'''''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution''''' is the last major work by [[India]]n [[humanism|humanist]] philosopher and political activist [[M. N. Roy]]. Deemed by some to be his "magnum opus," the book was published in two volumes, with the final manuscript readied for the press in the spring of 1952.

The first volume appeared in August 1952 with the second volume published posthumously in May 1955. The work is a survey of the development of Western political thought as reflected through the prism of Roy's personal philosophical ideas and includes a presentation of his own original thinking about a so-called "New Humanism."

Roy]] began work on what would be his final major project, ''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution,'' in 1948.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Ramendra Nath, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/roy_mn/ Manbendra Nath Roy (1887—1954),"] Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Roy's process of research, writing, and revision would continue for nearly half a decade, with the final typescript prepared for the press in April 1952.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt;

In introducing his work, Roy asserted that modern civilization faced a "cultural and moral crisis" that compelled thoughtful people to seek a return to society's "humanist tradition."&lt;ref name=RoyI-v&gt;M.N. Roy, ''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution: Volume One.'' Calcutta: Renaissance Publishers, 1952; pg. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy attributed this crisis to a negative byproduct of the 19th Century victory of [[skepticism]] and [[empiricism]] over other more immutable and [[determinism|deterministic]] belief systems — a process which not only "set human spirit free" but which also ushered in new forms of subjugation.&lt;ref name=RoyI-v /&gt; "If empiricism deposed reason from the seat of the supreme judge, pragmatism subordinated moral values to practical considerations," Roy declared.&lt;ref name=RoyI-v /&gt;

''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution'' was in some ways an extension of an argument begun by Roy in his 1946 book, ''Beyond Communism to Humanism,'' in which the centralism and deterministic economic basis of Marxism was rejected as well as the atomized society associated with [[individualism]], in favor of a loosely structured "radical democracy" of self-governing local units which administered society at a local level, coordinating a cooperative economy.&lt;ref&gt;"Manabendra Nath Roy, 1887–1954," in Robert Benewick and Philip Green (eds.), ''The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers.'' London: Routledge, 1998; pp. 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to move past Marxism, Roy presented his book as a grand "humanist interpretation of cultural history" which also sought to "outline a comprehensive philosophy which links up social and political practice with a scientific metaphysics of rationality and ethics."&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution: Volume One,'' pg. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[File:Roy-reasonromanticism-dj.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Dust jacket of the Indian first edition of Volume Two of ''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution,'' published posthumously in 1955.]]
Roy's book attempted to systematically review the development of Western political philosophy from the birth of modern thought through the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emergence of 19th Century [[Romanticism]] and [[Liberalism]] as a reforming ethos, as well as the [[Marxism|Marxist]] response. Roy perceived Marxism at an impasse and posited his own theory of a "New Humanism" as an alternative to what he characterized as the "Crisis of the Twentieth Century."

===Critical response===

''Reason, Romanticism and Revolution'' proved to be Roy's best-known work, generating critical attention in European intellectual circles during the decade of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Narisetti8&gt;Innaiah Narisetti, ''M.N. Roy: Radical Humanist: Selected Writings.'' New York: Prometheus Books, 2004; pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy's work was lauded as "thorough" and "brilliant" by philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] in his 1955 book, ''[[The Sane Society]].''&lt;ref name=Narisetti8 /&gt;

[[image:Sadbook.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The cover of Michael Rosen's ''Sad Book'', illustrated by Quentin Blake.]]

'''''Sad Book''''' is a book by [[Michael Rosen]] and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]]. The book's topic is dealing with grief. Although it is marketed as a children's book, Rosen explicitly mentions on the inside book jacket that it is for everyone. The book chronicles Rosen's grief of the loss of his son Eddie, who died of [[meningitis]] aged 18.&lt;ref&gt;Dina Rabinovitch [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/24/booksforchildrenandteenagers.dinarabinovitch "Author of the month: Michael Rosen"], ''The Guardian'', 24 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosen said that the book arose after a group of children asked him questions about his son's death and they were able to discuss it in a "matter-of-fact" way.&lt;ref name=bradbury&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradbury|first1=Lorna|title='Sometimes sad is very big. All over me'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3636036/Sometimes-sad-is-very-big.-All-over-me.html|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 Jan 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a picture of Rosen looking happy, with text explaining that he is sad and only pretending to be happy. The book frequently uses a disconnect between text and image to communicate the complex feelings of grief.&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite web|title=MICHAEL ROSEN'S SAD BOOK|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7636-2597-9|website=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the book discusses the different feelings that bereavement brings, and ways of coping with them including distracting oneself and expressing feelings through writing. It also describes how Rosen found his despair lifting and how he was able to deal with his grief and think about the good times he had with his son.&lt;ref name=bradbury/&gt;

== Critical reaction==
''The Guardian'' found it very sad, but highly recommended it, saying, "''Sad Book'' doesn't hide the darkness. It doesn't try to pretend that suffering and sadness are easy to bear. But it does at least show that it's okay to feel bad sometimes."&lt;ref name=jordison&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordison|first1=Sam|title=Darkness in literature: Sad Book by Michael Rosen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/darkness-literature|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=The Guardian|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' considered whether it was suitable for children, and felt that parents would need to use the book as a stimulus for discussion and would have to explain some of its ideas.&lt;ref name=bradbury/&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' praised it for its candour and said it "will resonate with – and help – anyone mourning a loss or dealing with an indefinable sadness".&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;

[[File:VM 4680 Wuchang seed shops.jpg|thumb|A street full of seed shops in [[Wuhan]], China, a few blocks from [[Wuchang Railway Station]]]]
'''Seed companies''' produce and sell [[seed]]s for [[flower]]s, [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s to the
amateur [[gardener]]. The production of seed is a multibillion-dollar business, which uses
growing facilities and growing locations worldwide. While most seed is produced by large
specialist growers, large amounts are produced by small growers that produce only one to a few
crop types. These larger companies  supply seed both to commercial resellers and wholesalers.
The resellers  and wholesalers sell to vegetable and fruit growers, and to companies who package
seed into packets and sell them on to the amateur gardener.

Most seed companies or resellers that sell retail,  produce a catalog – generally published 
during early winter for seed to be sown the following spring. These catalogs are eagerly
awaited by the amateur gardener, as during winter months there is little that can be done in the
garden, so this time can be spent planning the following year’s gardening. The largest collection of nursery and seed trade catalogs in the [[United States|U.S.]] is held at the [[National Agricultural Library]]. The earliest catalogs there date from the late 18th century, with most published from the 1890s to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.nal.usda.gov/guide-collections/henry-g-gilbert-nursery-and-seed-trade-catalog-collection "Guide to the Collections: Henry G. Gilbert Nursery and Seed Trade Catalog Collection."] [[National Agricultural Library]], Special Collections. Retrieved April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shakers]] were among the earliest [[Shaker Seed Company|commercial producers of garden seeds]]; the first seeds sold in paper packets were produced by the [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District|Watervliet Shakers]].&lt;ref name=Deming&gt;''Work and worship among the Shakers: their craftsmanship and economic order,''  Edward Deming Andrews, Faith Andrews, Courier Dover Publications, 1982,  p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Landmarks of American women's history, Chapter: Watervliet Shaker Historic District, Page Putnam Miller, Oxford University Press US, 2003, pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed companies produce a huge range of seeds from highly developed [[F1 hybrid]]s to open
pollinated wild species.  Many gardeners like to stick to old familiar varieties but each year seed
companies produce new varieties for gardeners to try. They have extensive research facilities to
produce plants with better genetic materials that result in improved uniformity and gardening
appeal. These improved qualities might include disease resistance, higher yields, dwarf habit and
vibrant or new colors. These improvements are often closely guarded to protect them from being
utilized by other producers, thus plant cultivars are often sold under their own names and by
international laws protected from being grown for seed production by others.	
Along with the growth in the [[allotment (gardening)|allotment movement]], and the increasing
popularity of gardening, there have emerged many small independent seed companies. Many of
these are active in seed [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and encouraging diversity. They
often offer [[List of organic gardening and farming topics|organic]] and open
[[Pollination|pollinated]] varieties of seeds as opposed to hybrids. Many of these varieties are
heirloom varieties. The use of old varieties will continue to maintain diversity in the
[[horticulture|horticultural]] [[gene pool]]. There is a good case for amateur gardeners to use
older (heirloom) varieties as the modern seed types are often the same as those grown by
commercial producers, and so characteristics which are useful to them (e.g. vegetables ripening
at the same time) may be unsuited to home growing.

== History ==
Until 1924, US farmers received seed from the federal government's extensive free seed program that distributed millions of packages of seed annually.  At its high point in 1897, over 2 million packages of seed were distributed to farmers.  Even at the time the program was eliminated in 1924, it was the third largest line item in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s budget.

In 1930, seed companies were not primarily concerned with varietal production, but were still trying to successfully commodify seeds.  There was no need to protect seed breeding at that time because there were few markets for seeds.  Seed companies first priority was simply to establish a market, and they continued to view the congressional distribution as a principal constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Susan A. Schneider, Food, Farming, and Sustainability p. 563-64 (2011) (discussing J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., 534 U.S. 124 (2001))&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seed packets and seed information ==
[[Image:South Central Farm 1.jpg|thumb|A farmer's son holding out seeds]]
Generally, seed packets labels includes: 
* Common plant name and the [[botanical]] name (in parentheses).
* Space and deep: how deep to place the seeds in the [[soil]], space between plants (from one row to the other one and from one plant to the other one in the same row).
* [[Height]]: approximate [[height]] the plant will reach when mature.
* [[Soil]]: type of soil the plant prefers.
* [[Water]]: It can indicate "keep the soil lightly [[Moisture|damp]]", "bottom water the plant", "drench the soil with water", "daily [[misting]] of water" and "almost dry out before re-watering".
* [[Sun]]: full direct sunlight, partial sun, diffused sunlight, or grows well in the [[shade (shadow)|shade]].
* Door: if the plant is best suited for growing [[Indoor]], [[Outdoor]] or Both.
* Live: [[perennial plant|Perennial]] or [[annual plant|annual]].
* [[Planting]], [[germination]] and [[harvest]] period: This information can be indicated by months or [[4 (number)|quarters]] of the year.
* Special requirements, if necessary.
This information can be represented graphically.

The mission started on November 16, 1973 with the launch of three astronauts on a [[Saturn IB]] rocket from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida and lasted 84 days, one hour and 16 minutes. A total of 6,051 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by Skylab 4 astronauts performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, observation of the [[Comet Kohoutek]] and other experiments.

The manned Skylab missions were officially designated ''Skylab 2'', ''3'', and ''4''. Mis-communication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading ''Skylab I'', ''Skylab II'', and ''Skylab 3'' respectively.&lt;ref name=numbering /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/naming_spacecraft.html|title=Naming Spacecraft: Confusion Reigns|last=Pogue|first=William|publisher=collectSPACE|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Skylab controversy}}
The all-rookie astronaut crew arrived aboard Skylab to find that they had company – three figures dressed in flight suits. Upon closer inspection, they found their companions were three dummies, complete with Skylab 4 mission emblems and name tags which had been left there by [[Al Bean]], [[Jack Lousma]], and [[Owen Garriott]] at the end of [[Skylab 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Photo-sl3-113-1587|url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/skylab/skylab3/html/sl3-113-1587.html|website = spaceflight.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things got off to a bad start after the crew attempted to hide Pogue's early [[space sickness]] from flight surgeons, a fact discovered by mission controllers after downloading onboard voice recordings.  Astronaut office chief [[Alan B. Shepard]] reprimanded them for this omission, saying they "had made a fairly serious error in judgement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/18/archives/skylab-astronauts-are-reprimanded-in-1st-day-aboard-learned-from.html |title=Skylab Astronauts Are Reprimanded In 1st Day Aboard |last=Wilford |first=John Noble |date=November 18, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The crew had problems adjusting to the same workload level as their predecessors when activating the workshop. The crew's initial task of unloading and stowing the thousands of items needed for their lengthy mission also proved to be overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/19/archives/astronauts-try-to-make-up-time-skylab-3-lehind-schedule-as-result.html |title=Astronauts Try to Make Up Time |date=November 19, 1973| agency=Associated Press |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule for the activation sequence dictated lengthy work periods with a large variety of tasks to be performed, and the crew soon found themselves tired and behind schedule.

Seven days into their mission, a problem developed in the Skylab [[Control moment gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[attitude control]] system, which threatened to bring an early end to the mission. Skylab depended upon three large gyroscopes, sized so that any two of them could provide sufficient control and maneuver Skylab as desired. The third acted as a backup in the event of failure of one of the others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/24/archives/a-skylab-gyroscope-fails-leaving-only-2-for-control.html |title=A Skylab Gyroscope Fails, Leaving Only 2 for Control |date=November 24, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The gyroscope failure was attributed to insufficient [[lubrication]]. Later in the mission, a second gyroscope showed similar problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/08/archives/gyro-on-skylab-is-erratic-officials-are-not-alarmed.html |title=Gyro on Skylab Is Erratic; Officials Are Not Alarmed |date=December 8, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/04/archives/skylab-gyroscope-falters-puzzling-ground-engineers.html |title=Skylab Gyroscope Falters, Puzzling Ground Engineers |date=January 4, 1974 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=United Press International |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but special temperature control and load reduction procedures kept the second one operating, and no further problems occurred.

On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], Gibson and Pogue accomplished a 6½ hour spacewalk. The first part of their spacewalk was  spent deploying experiments and replacing film in the solar observatory. The remainder of the time was used to repair a malfunctioning antenna.  During the experience, Gibson remarked, "Boy if this isn't the great outdoors!  Inside, you're just looking out through a window.  Here, you're right in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/23/archives/2-astronauts-fix-skylab-antenna-space-walk-for-repairs-and.html |title=Two Astronauts fix Skylab Antenna |date=November 23, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew reported that the food was good, but slightly bland. The quantity and type of food consumed was rigidly controlled because of their strict diet. Although the crew would have preferred to use more condiments to enhance the taste of the food, and the amount of salt they could use was restricted for medical purposes, by the third mission the NASA kitchen had increased the availability of condiments, and salt and pepper was in liquid solutions (granular salt and pepper brought aboard by the second crew was little more than "air pollution").  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.voicesofoklahoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pogue_Transcript.pdf Voices of Oklahoma (2013 pg 33), Wm Pogue&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, the crew sighted [[Comet Kohoutek]] and trained the solar observatory and hand-held cameras on it. They gathered spectra on it using the [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SP-404 Skylab's Astronomy and Space Sciences|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-404/ch4.htm|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041113100704/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-404/ch4.htm|archivedate=November 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continued to photograph it as it approached the Sun. On December 30, as it swept out from behind the Sun, Carr and Gibson spotted it as they were performing a spacewalk.

As Skylab work progressed, the astronauts complained of being pushed too hard, and ground controllers complained they weren't getting enough work done.  NASA determined major contributing factors were a large number of new tasks added shortly before launch with little or no training, and searches for equipment out of place on the station.&lt;ref name="NatGeo74"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/12/archives/lethargy-of-skylab-3-crew-is-studied.html |title=Lethargy of Skylab 3 Crew Is Studied |agency=Reuters |date=December 12, 1973 |access-date=2018-07-11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/skylab-crew-takes-day-off-for-rest.html |title=Skylab Crew Takes Day Off for Rest |date=November 25, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a radio conference to air frustrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/31/archives/astronauts-debate-work-schedules-with-controllers.html |title=Astronauts Debate Work Schedules With Controllers |date=December 31, 1973 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-07-11 |agency=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the workload schedule being modified, and by the end of their mission the crew had completed even more work than originally planned. 

The experiences of the crew and ground controllers provided important lessons in planning subsequent manned spaceflight work schedules. At the same time, in the years following the mission the mistakes and disagreements received added scrutiny. Several writers embellished the more dramatic aspects that led to the radio conference, introducing both “strike” and “mutiny” to the interpretation of events. These and other controversial terms continue to be used, even if inaccurately, to describe the hours leading up to the conference between astronauts and mission control.{{cn|date=October 2018|reason=Strong claims about living persons}}

Apart from the controversies, Skylab 4 was noted for several important science contributions. The crew spent many hours studying the Earth. Carr and Pogue alternately manned controls, operating the sensing devices which measured and photographed selected features on the Earth's surface. Gibson and the other crew made solar observations, recording about 75,000 new telescopic images of the Sun. Images were taken in the [[X-ray]], [[ultraviolet]], and visible portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name="NatGeo74"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/gibson-eg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As the end of their mission drew closer, Gibson continued his watch of the solar surface.
On January 21, 1974, an active region on the Sun's surface formed a bright spot which intensified and grew.&lt;ref name="NatGeo74"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Canby |first=Thomas |date=October 1974 |title=Skylab, Outpost on the Frontier of Space |url=https://archive.nationalgeographic.com/?iid=54304#folio=468 |journal=National Geographic Magazine |volume=146 |pages=441-493}}{{rp|468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson quickly began filming the sequence as the bright spot erupted. This film was the first recording from space of the birth of a [[solar flare]].

The crew also photographed the Earth from orbit. Despite instructions not to do so, the crew (perhaps inadvertently) photographed [[Area 51]], causing a minor dispute between various government agencies as to whether the photographs showing this secret facility should be released. In the end, the picture was published along with all others in NASA's Skylab image archive, but remained unnoticed for years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1010/1 The Space Review: Secret Apollo] published November 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skylab 4 astronauts completed 1,214 Earth orbits and four EVAs totaling 22 hours, 13 minutes. They traveled 34.5 million miles (55,500,000&amp;nbsp;km) in 84 days, 1 hour and 16 minutes in space. Skylab 4 was the last Skylab mission, the station fell from orbit in 1979.

The three astronauts had joined NASA in the mid-1960s, during the [[Apollo program]], with Pogue and Carr becoming part of the likely crew for the cancelled [[Apollo 19]]. Ultimately none of the crew of Skylab 4 flew in space again, as none of the three had been selected for [[Apollo-Soyuz]] and all of them retired from NASA before the first [[Space Shuttle]] launch. Gibson, who had trained as a [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|scientist-astronaut]], resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data, as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corp. of Los Angeles, California.

==Mission insignia==
The triangular emblem features a large number ''3'' and a rainbow circling three areas of study the astronauts pursued. At the time of the flight, the astronauts issued the following description:

"The symbols in the patch refer to the three major areas of investigation in the mission. The tree represents man's natural environment and refers to the objective of advancing the study of earth resources. The hydrogen atom, as the basic building block of the universe, represents man's exploration of the physical world, his application of knowledge, and his development of technology. Since the sun is composed primarily of hydrogen, the hydrogen symbol also refers to the Solar Physics mission objectives. The human silhouette represents mankind and the human capacity to direct technology with a wisdom tempered by his regard for his natural environment. It also relates to the Skylab medical studies of man himself. The rainbow, adopted from the Biblical story of the Flood, symbolizes the promise that is offered to man. It embraces man and extends to the tree and hydrogen atom, emphasizing man's pivotal role in the conciliation of technology with nature by a humanistic application of our scientific knowledge." Some versions of the patch included a comet in the top curve because of studies made of the comet Kohoutek.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''Stanisław Baranowski''' (25 March 1935 – 27 August 1978) was a Polish [[Glaciology|glaciologist]] and leader or member of a number of scientific expeditions to [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Antarctica]]. He died as a result of an accident near the [[Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station]] while on expedition. At the time of his death, he was head of the Department of Metereology and Climatology at the [[University of Wrocław]].

[[Stanisław Baranowski Spitsbergen Polar Station]] and [[Baranowski Glacier]] are named after him.

==Biography==
Stanisław Baranowski was  born in [[Gdynia]], [[Poland]] on 25 March 1935 and graduated from the University of Wrocław in 1955.&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt; He carried out studies in [[glaciology]] and [[climatology]] and participated in many polar expeditions, beginning with the expedition to [[Spitsbergen]] during the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958).&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt; Subsequently, he organized and led a number of Polish expeditions to that region, as well as to [[Canada]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Sudety Mountains]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt; He wrote over fifty scientific articles and papers.&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt; In 1971, he became a [[docent]] and the head of the Department of Metereology and Climatology at the University of Wrocław. He received his [[habilitation]] in 1976.

In January 1978, while sleeping near the [[Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station]] on [[King George Island (South Shetland Islands)|King George Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], he was poisoned by gas escaping from a leaking cylinder. Despite receiving medical treatment, he never regained consciousness and died in a hospital in [[Bytom]], Poland on 27 August 1978.&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt;

His obituary, published in the ''[[Journal of Glaciology]]'', stated the following: "Stanisław Baranowski was widely known and universally liked, and it is especially tragic that he died so young and while at the height of his creative powers."&lt;ref name="SocietySociety1979"/&gt;

The polar station he had founded in Spitsbergen was named the [[Stanisław Baranowski Spitsbergen Polar Station]] in his memory. A commemorative plaque has been put up at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station where he suffered his accident.&lt;ref name="BaranowskiJahn1977"/&gt; The [[Baranowski Glacier]] is also named after him.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

'''Asteroid terraria''' are fictional [[space habitat]]s described in the [[hard science fiction]] novel [[2312 (novel)|''2312'']] (2012) by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]. In the novel, a 'terrarium' is an artificially created ecosystem living in the cylindrically shaped hollow interior of an [[asteroid]]. This hollow space is crafted with [[self replicating machine]] excavators. On the inner surface of this hollow cylinder an [[ecosystem]] can thrive in artificial gravity resulting from [[centripetal force]], produced by spinning the asteroid on its longest axis. At least 2 kilometers of solid asteroid wall are left at all points around the hollow interior to provide [[Radiation burn|radiation]] shielding and protection from interplanetary material, except at the entry hole. A lighting element, called a 'sunline', is strung inside the cylinder along the [[Axis powers|axis]] of rotation to provide artificial light. The lit part of the line travels the length of the cylinder to [[Simulated child pornography|simulate]] the Sun’s path over Earth’s sky.  During night phase, street lights, on the inner surface overhead, resemble stars.

Robinson writes about the infinite possibilities for terraria ecosystems, e.g. savannas, water worlds, genetically engineered ecospheres or habitats with new species, called 'Ascensions', resulting from the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of common ones. Terraria are not only created for residential purposes; in ''2312'' they also function as farming worlds (producing food for [[Earth]]) and transportation vessels. Propelled through the solar system, they follow regular routes, non-stop, like unclaimed asteroids do. Ferries wishing to board them need to match their speeds. Terraria make travel from Earth to the outer planets a matter of weeks, like did transatlantic voyages before the steam engine. In the novel, the ''Alfred Wegener'' (presumably named after a [[Alfred Wegener|German geophysicist]]) is one such terrarium, in an excavated cylinder twenty kilometers long and five across:

{{quote|Grass prairie and patches of forest arched like a giant Sistine Chapel overhead, a Sistine on which Michelangelo had painted a version of Eden—a savanna, the first human landscape, appealing to something very deep in the mind. Although terrarium topology always made Wahram feel as if he were inside a map that had been rolled into a tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Kim Stanley|title=2312|year=2012|publisher=Orbit|isbn=0316098124|url=http://www.orbitbooks.net/2312/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''VASP Flight 375''' was a hijacked flight on September 29, 1988 by Raimundo Nonato Alves da Conceição, who aimed to crash the plane with 98 passengers and 7 crew aboard against the [[Planalto Palace]] in [[Brasília]]. The flight, in a [[Boeing 737-300]] aircraft, left [[Porto Velho]] for [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], making stops in [[Brasilia]], [[Goiânia]] and [[Belo Horizonte]]. In the final phase of the flight between Belo Horizonte to Rio de Janeiro, the plane was hijacked and diverted to Brasília. The hijacking was not successful and the aircraft ended up landing safely in Goiânia. The only fatal victim as a result of the kidnapping was one of the [[co-pilot]]s, Salvador Evangelista.

Fernando Murilo de Lima e Silva, the pilot who avoided the tragedy, was honored in October 2001 by the National Aeronaut Union and received the Aeronautical Highlight trophy for avoiding the death of the nearly 100 passengers aboard the flight.

Raimundo Nonato Alves da Conceição was born in [[Vitorino Freire]], coming from a poor family in the interior of [[Pará]] and was considered calm. He worked as a tractor driver in several construction companies. At the age of 28, he had lost his job at the Mendes Júnior construction company in [[Minas Gerais]]. By the end of the 1980s, [[Brazil]] faced a poor economic phase with high unemployment and inflation. Raimundo decided to punish those who thought he was guilty of the bad situation he and the country were going through: the then President of the Republic, [[José Sarney]], launching an airplane against the [[Planalto Palace]], where the Presidential Office is located.

== Hijacking ==
Raimundo bought a [[.32 S&amp;W|32-caliber]] revolver and boarded [[VASP]] flight 375. It is important to note that at the time, [[X-ray]] machines and [[metal detector]]s were not used to check baggage at [[Confins Airport]], which allowed free passage of the passenger. The flight, which came from [[Porto Velho]] and stopped at [[Belo Horizonte]], took off at 10:42&amp;nbsp;am and about 20 minutes after takeoff, with the plane already in the air space of [[Rio de Janeiro]], Raimundo Nonato announced the hijacking: said he wanted to enter in the cockpit and shot Ronaldo Dias, a [[flight attendant]], when he tried to stop him. He fired several times at the cockpit door, broke it open, and went inside. Upon entering, Raimundo shot the [[flight engineer]], Gilberto Renher, who had his leg fractured by the shot. Without the hijacker, pilot Fernando Murilo de Lima e Silva called for the transponder code 7500, which in the language of aeronautics indicates illegal interference ([[Aircraft hijacking|Hijacking]]). While attempting to answer [[Cindacta]]'s radio response, [[co-pilot]] Salvador Evangelista was shot by the hijacker and died instantly. Raimundo then pointed the revolver at the pilot and demanded that the aircraft be diverted immediately to [[Brasília]].

Raimundo eventually gave up throwing the plane against the [[Planalto Palace]], but prevented the pilot from landing the plane with almost no fuel at [[Brasília International Airport]] or at [[Anápolis Air Force Base]]. When he approached [[Goiânia]], the pilot made two acrobatic maneuvers (a "tonneau" and a bolt) that were witnessed by a [[Mirage III]] fighter. It was successful in the second maneuver, which allowed a quick landing at [[Santa Genoveva Airport]] at 1:45&amp;nbsp;pm. On land, the hijacking and negotiations continued for several hours. The hijacker even demanded a smaller plane to flee, but around 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm, when he was descending the flight ladder using the pilot as a [[shield]], he was shot three times by the elite [[Brazil Federal Police]] team. He died two days later, a victim of [[Sickle-cell disease]], unrelated to the shots, according to the [[coroner]] Fortunato Badan Palhares.

== The aircraft ==
The aircraft was a [[Boeing 737-300|Boeing 737-3L9]] (manufacturers serial number 23176, Boeing line number 1213, registration PP-SNT). It was manufactured in 1986. It was sold to [[CP Air]] in April 1986, after he was delivered to [[VASP]], [[Guinness Peat Aviation]], [[Morris Air Service]] and ultimately ending up in the fleet of [[U.S]] carrier [[Southwest Airlines]]. Southwest stopped service of the aircraft under the registration N698SW in 2013, owing to severe damage and scrapped in [[Greenwood Airport]] since then.
