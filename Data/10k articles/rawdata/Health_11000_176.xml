'''A New Day Cambodia''' ('''ANDC'''), founded in the [[United States]] in 2007, is an international  [[Humanitarian aid|relief]] and [[Social development|development]] organization whose goal is to provide shelter, food, and education for impoverished children in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]]. The board consists of four founding members, none of whom take a salary for their contributions.

==History==
ANDC was founded in 2006 by Bill Smith, the team photographer for the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[United Center]]. During the sporting offseason, Smith and his wife Lauren would take annual trips to Southeast Asia to photograph the changing culture and landscape. In 2002, Smith was taken to the Stung Mean Chey garbage dump by his Cambodian driver, and was stunned to see the conditions that children were living in. Children were forced to live and work in the garbage dump to provide for their families. The children, in addition to living and working in the squalor, were unable to attend school because their families needed the $10–12 a month that was provided by the children working in the dump.

Smith began to support several children that worked in these garbage dumps, enrolling the children in school and paying the families the lost monthly income, ensuring the children would never work another day in the dump.

The Smiths told their stories to family and friends, who began giving money to Smith to support additional children. In 2006, a front page article ran in the [[Chicago Tribune]] about the Smiths' work in Cambodia. After an overwhelming response of donations, Bill Smith founded A New Day Cambodia.

The charity now has two dormitories in [[Phnom Penh]] housing 99 children. The children attend English and [[Khmer language]] schooling in a day, and live at the center. All children attend private schools, with some of the most gifted students attending the most prestigious schools in Cambodia. The cost of education, activities, room and board is approximately $1800 per child each year.

In 2010, [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]] aired a 30-minute special on ANDC and the Smiths' journey to found the centers. The entire show is available online.

'''Accessible India Campaign''' or '''Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan''' is a program which is set to be launched to serve the [[Differently abled|differently-able]] community of the country. The program comes with an index to measure the design of disabled-friendly buildings and human resource policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyaan) to make India Disabled – Friendly|url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=126123|website = pib.nic.in|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flagship program has been launched by the Prime Minister on 3 December 2015, the [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities|International Day of Persons with Disabilities]]. The initiative also in line with the Article 9 of UNCRPD([[United Nations|UN]] Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) to which India is a signatory since 2007.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Govt launches Accessible India Campaign for persons with disabilities|url = http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Vjz7Tt6l5UfGxyaYCHVygP/Govt-launches-Accessible-India-Campaign-for-persons-with-dis.html|website=livemint.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme also comes under [[Persons with Disabilities Act]], 1995 under section 44, 45, 46 for equal Opportunities and protection of rights which provides non-discrimination in Transport to Persons with Disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (Page 1) - About the Division - Empowerment of Persons With Disabilities: Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India|url = http://socialjustice.nic.in/pwdact1995.php|website = socialjustice.nic.in|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Targets ==
According to the [[2011 Census of India]], 2.21 per cent of the population or approximately 26.8 million Indians suffer from a disability. The target is to make at least fifty percent government buildings disabled friendly under the campaign in each of the state capital and central capital till end of May 2018 and make 25 per cent of the public transport vehicles under government as disabled friendly till mid 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unnoticed, unheard: Will the ‘Accessible India’ campaign be a success?|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/unnoticed-unheard-will-the-accessible-india-campaign-be-a-success/|website = The Indian Express|date = 2015-10-05|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also envisages further development with bigger targets in the following years. In this way, the overall environment becomes more inclusive and provides equal opportunities to the Pwd. A website will also be made where the people can put their views on the accessibility of any building.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Government Initiatives That Aim to Improve Lives of People with Disabilities - The Better India|url = http://www.thebetterindia.com/31834/government-initiatives-for-the-accessible-india-campaign/|website = The Better India|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2016, the international airports in the country and railway stations which come under A1, A and B categories will be made fully disabled-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accessible India Campaign to achieve universal accessibility for persons with disabilities|url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/accessible-india-campaign-to-achieve-universal-accessibility-for-persons-with-disabilities-115120301433_1.html|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special set-top boxes will be made available to make watching TV more convenient for the visually impaired. In the next 5 years, almost 200 persons will be trained to speak in sign languages on government TV channels. Government websites will also be made more friendly by using text to speech option. The initiative involves retrofitting buildings, framing such standards for new buildings and transport that they are friendly to the differently-abled, auditing private companies on 'accessibility index' standard and making all government websites friendly to the differently-abled.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PM Modi to launch 'Accessible India Campaign' for persons with disabilities on December 3 - The Economic Times|url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-set-to-launch-accessible-india-campaign-for-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/49985348.cms|website = The Economic Times|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Sugamya Bharat'''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; mobile app which can provide information on disabled-friendly public facilities in a city, will be launched under the scheme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
On 9 November 2017, RBI  asked the banks to provide doorstep banking facilities to senior citizens of more than 70 years of age and differently-abled persons including the visually-impaired.

==Rating==
There will a collection of 10 private companies from different sectors including textiles and manufacturing which will be included in the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accessible India: Disabled-friendly initiatives to earn firms brownie points from Modi government - The Economic Times|url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/accessible-india-disabled-friendly-initiatives-to-earn-firms-brownie-points-from-modi-government/articleshow/49474198.cms|website = The Economic Times|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters will include investment in the training of the differently able employees and their career growth and the quality of facilities provided to them. The range of rating is 1 to 10. The structure of the points allotment and data management has been estimated by the department of disability affairs which comes under the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|ministry of social justice and empowerment]]. The government sees this campaign as an ethical push with the help of the index for the corporate sector under the [[Corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and incentives will be given according to their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accessible India Campaign:: Department of Disability Affairs|url = http://innovationclustersarchive.nic.in/content/accessible_india.php|website = innovationclustersarchive.nic.in|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Features ==
The ministry of social justice and empowerment will give free motorized tricycles to persons with 70-90% disability.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Each state has to choose at least 50-100 public buildings which are friendly to persons with disabilities. Till 2016, the program aims to make public buildings in 50 cities of the country under the prescribed guidelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For awareness, a team of experts will conduct workshops for sensitizing the main parties including builders and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arun Jaitley launches Accessible India Campaign|url = http://www.livemint.com/Politics/WVnP3GzPJhqsYyBQgiNaEP/Arun-Jaitley-launches-Accessible-India-Campaign.html|website=livemint.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and name==
The species is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] [[entomologist]] [[Agostino Bassi]], who discovered it in 1815 as the cause of the muscardine disease which then led to carriers transmitting it by airborne means. It was formerly also known as ''Tritirachium shiotae''.  The name ''B. bassiana'' has long been used to describe a [[species complex]] of morphologically similar and closely related [[isolates]]. Rehner and Buckley &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rehner SA, Buckley E |journal=Mycologia |year=2005  |title=A Beauveria phylogeny inferred from nuclear ITS and EF1-&lt;nowiki/&gt;{alpha} sequences: evidence for cryptic diversification and links to Cordyceps teleomorphs |volume=97 |pages=84–98 |pmid=16389960 |issue=1 |doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.1.84|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=37383&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that ''B. bassiana'' consists of many distinct lineages that should be recognized as distinct phylogenetic species and the genus ''[[Beauveria]]'' was redescribed with a proposed type for ''B. bassiana'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rehner | first1 = Stephen A. | last2 = Minnis | first2 = Andrew M. | last3 = Sung | first3 = Gi-Ho | last4 = Luangsaard | first4 = J. Jennifer | last5 = Devotto | first5 = Luis | last6 = Humber | first6 = Richard A. | year = 2011 | title = Phylogeny and systematics of the anamorphic, entomopathogenic genus ''Beauveria'' | url = | journal = Mycologia | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 1055–1073 | doi=10.3852/10-302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of this work and the known existence of [[cryptic species]], it is important to characterise [[Primary isolate|isolate]]s used to develop [[biological insecticides]].

===Relation to ''Cordyceps'' and other fungi===
''Beauveria bassiana'' is the [[anamorph]] (asexually reproducing form) of ''[[Cordyceps]] bassiana''. The latter [[teleomorph]] (the sexually reproducing form) has been collected only in eastern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03187215|vauthors=Li ZZ, Li CR, Huang B, Fan MZ |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=2001 |title=Discovery and demonstration of the teleomorph of ''Beauveria bassiana'' (Bals.) Vuill., an important entomogenous fungus |volume=46|issue=9 |pages=751–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White muscardine disease===
The [[insect]] disease caused by the fungus is a [[muscardine]] which has been called '''white muscardine disease'''. When the microscopic spores of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate, penetrate the [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]], and grow inside, killing the insect within a matter of days. Afterwards, a white mold emerges from the cadaver and produces new spores. A typical isolate of ''B. bassiana'' can attack a broad range of insects; various isolates differ in their host range. The factors responsible for host susceptibility are not known.

[[File:WhiteMuscardineDiseaseGoldenSilkOrbWeaver.jpg|thumb|Spotted in [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]] a [[Golden silk orb-weaver]] dead from white muscardine disease with white mold emerging from the cadaver's joints and pores.]]

''Beauveria bassiana'' parasitizing the [[Colorado potato beetle]] has been reported to be, in turn, the host of a mycoparasitic fungus ''[[Syspastospora parasitica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Posada, F. |title=''Syspastospora parasitica'', a mycoparasite of the fungus ''Beauveria bassiana'' attacking the Colorado potato beetle ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'': a tritrophic association |journal=J. Insect Sci. |volume=4 |page=24 |year=2004 |pmid=15861239 |pmc=528884 |doi=10.1093/jis/4.1.24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organism also attacks related insect-pathogenic species of the [[Clavicipitaceae]].

==Morphology of the fungus==
In culture, ''B. bassiana'' grows as a white [[mould]]. On most common cultural media, it produces many dry, powdery [[conidia]] in distinctive white [[spore]] balls. Each spore ball is composed of a cluster of conidiogenous cells.  The conidiogenous cells of ''B. bassiana'' are short and ovoid, and terminate in a narrow apical extension called a [[rachis]].  The rachis elongates after each conidium is produced, resulting in a long zig-zag extension. The conidia are single-celled, [[haploid]], and [[hydrophobic]].

==Use in biological control of insects==
''Beauveria bassiana'' can be used as a biological [[insecticide]] to control a number of pests such as [[termite]]s, [[whitefly|whiteflies]], and many other insects. Its use in the control of [[malaria]]-transmitting [[mosquito]]s is under investigation.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As an insecticide, the spores are sprayed on affected crops as an emulsified suspension or wettable powder or applied to [[mosquito net]]s as a mosquito control agent.

As a species, ''Beauveria bassiana'' parasitizes a very wide range of arthropod hosts. However, different [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s vary in their host ranges, some having rather narrow ranges, like strain Bba 5653 that is very virulent to the [[larva]]e of the [[diamondback moth]] and kills only few other types of [[caterpillars]]. Some strains do have a wide host range and should therefore be considered nonselective [[biological insecticide]]s. These should not be applied to flowers visited by [[pollinating]] insects.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_128924.htm|title=EPA Factsheet|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungus rarely infects humans or other animals, so it is generally considered safe as an insecticide. However, at least one case of human infection by ''B. bassiana'' has been reported in a person with a suppressed immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tucker DL, Beresford CH, Sigler L, Rogers K |title=Disseminated Beauveria bassiana infection in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia |journal=J.

[[Image:Kleine Wundarzney.png|right]]
'''Benedictus Figulus''' (born December 29, 1567) of Utenhofen was a German [[alchemist]], publisher, and [[Rosicrucian]]. He was an editor of Paracelsian texts and an important representative of [[Paracelsianism]] in the early 17th century.

==Life==
At the beginning of the 1610s, he was commissioned by the printer [[Lazare Zetzner]] to prepare a second edition of the great alchemical anthology, the [[Theatrum Chernicum]], of which he projected three new volumes under the passably mystical title ''Théâtre d'or tout nouveau et béni, rayonnant des opulentes richesses du présent siècle d'or, rempli des ouvrages jusqu'alors inconnus, des plus excellents philosophes, tant anciens que modernes, traitant de la grande merveille bénie et du miraculeux mystère de la pierre physique et tinctoriale, de sa préparation et de son acquisition.'' (''Theatre of gold all new and blessed, shining from its opulent riches of the present golden century, full of works even unknown, of most excellent philosophers, both ancient and modern, treating the great blessed marvel and the miraculous mystery of the physical stone and tinctorial, of its preparation and its acquisition.'') This was at the time when [[Rosicrucianism]] was emerging, and Figulus's friend [[Adam Haslmayr]], an early proponent of Rosicrucianism, was arrested. Worried, Figulus abandoned his work and fled.

==Works==
* ''Carmen heroicum, Insignia Megalandri Lutheri complectens'', Stuttgart 1600
* ''Paraphrasis Graeco-Latina Psalmi XXIII Regii propheta Davidis carmine Alcaico expressa: Item Psalmi CIII poetica versio Trilinguis'', 1603 
* ''Pandora magnalium naturalium aurea et benedicta de Paracelse'', Lazare Zetzner, Strasbourg 1608

* ''Kleine Wundarzney  de Paracelse'', Strasbourg 1608 
* ''Thesaurinella olympica aurea tripartita'', Frankfurt 1608

In 1893 [[Arthur Edward Waite]] translated ''Pandora magnalium naturalium aurea et benedicta'' into English as ''A Golden Casket of Nature's Marvels''. It contains ''The Book of the Revelation of Hermes interpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus Concerning the Supreme Secret of the World'', and tracts by Figulus, [[Alexander von Suchten]], Conrad Poyselius, and others.

'''Biliary fever''' is an illness of the [[liver]] affecting [[horse]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black's Veterinary Dictionary |last=Boden |first=Edward |author2=Geoffrey Philip West |year=1998 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=978-0-389-21017-7 |page=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dog]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Veterinary Parasitology |last=Griffiths |first=Henry Joseph |year=1978 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=978-0-8166-0834-8 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=C. |author2=F.J. Dunning |year=1937 |title=Biliary fever (nuttalliosis) of the cat. a case in the Stellenbosch District |journal=Journal of the South African Veterinary Medical Association |volume=8 |issue= |pages=83–88 |issn= |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is currently the most common infectious disease of dogs in Southern Africa. It is also known as '''tick bite fever''' or "Bosluiskoors" in Afrikaans. It is caused by a tiny parasite (''[[Babesia canis]]'') which is introduced into the body by a [[tick bite]]. This parasite then enters and destroys [[red blood cell]]s. Biliary in dogs has a lot in common with [[malaria]] in man, except that in the latter, a [[mosquito]] is the [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]].

== Clinical signs of disease ==

The peracute (very sudden and severe) form causes death within a few hours and treatment is of little avail.  More commonly dogs suffer from the acute or subacute form. This is recognised by the dog being listless or lethargic, losing its appetite and running a temperature. If your dog is off its food, take a rectal temperature reading. If this is 39&amp;nbsp;°C or higher you should have the dog examined – do not wait until its mucous membranes become pale, white or yellow, which commonly suggests a more advanced stage of the disease. Fever is present only while the patient is actively fighting the parasite; the disease may be present with a normal (38,5&amp;nbsp;°C) or subnormal temperature. Yellow faeces and brown or red urine also suggests the presence of biliary fever.
==Diagnosis==

 A small drop of blood is collected and a smear made. Once stained, the parasites can be seen in the red blood cells under microscopic evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetcareclinics.co.za/educare/an-overview-of-biliary-in-dogs/4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

A vaccine has been launched in South Africa at the end of 2008. Nobivac Piro, has been proven effective when combined with twice yearly booster shots. Rely on reducing the dog's tick population by regular use of approved tick control measures that may be recommended by a veterinarian.

== Treatment ==

Treatment should only be given after a positive diagnosis has been made by means of a blood test. Usually treatment is effective, depending on several factors, but the majority will respond. In early cases simple injections are usually sufficient, but in others blood transfusions, electrolyte infusions per vein, liver tonics, blood-building, etc., may be required.

=== Diet ===

Avoid fatty foods, and give a good quality balanced dog food. A tonic and/or follow up treatment may be required if the animal does not appear to be responding to the initial treatment.

The society provides a forum for members to debate current issues in [[Restorative Dentistry]] and especially in [[Prosthodontics]].  

The conference calendar includes two scientific meetings a year (Spring and Autumn) and the once three- yearly Dental Pan Society meeting. The society is affiliated to the ''[[European Journal of Prosthodontics and Restorative Dentistry]]'', and has also published policy documents on ‘Guidelines for Crown and Bridge’ and ‘A Strategy for Planning Restorative Care’. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Belarus]]'''. It carried out at least four executions in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been a part of the country's legal system since gaining independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. The current [[Constitution of Belarus|national constitution]] prescribes this punishment for "grave crimes." Later laws have clarified the specific crimes for which capital punishment can be used. Capital punishment can be imposed for crimes that occur against the State or against individuals. A few non-violent crimes can also be punishable by death. Belarus is the only State in Europe that continues to carry out the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International- Document- Commonwealth of Independent states: Belarus- the last executioner&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a referendum on the issue, the Belarusian government took steps to change the way capital punishment is imposed and carried out.&lt;ref name="byemb"&gt;Embassy of Belarus in the United Kingdom [http://www.belembassy.org/uk/capital.html Capital Punishment in Belarus and Changes of Belarus Criminal Legislation related thereto]. Retrieved May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; International organisations, such as the United Nations, have criticised the methods Belarus uses when carrying out capital punishment. The use of capital punishment is one factor keeping the country out of the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name="brestonline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brestonline.com/en/news/archy2001m4.html|title=Seminar on death penalty abolition held in Brest|accessdate=2007-11-03|publisher=BrestOnline|date=2001-04-05|author=Belpan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209172656/http://brestonline.com/en/news/archy2001m4.html|archive-date=2006-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Article 24 of the [[Constitution of Belarus]] states that:
{{cquote|Until its abolition, the death sentence may be applied in accordance with the law as an exceptional penalty for especially grave crimes and only in accordance with the [[verdict]] of a court of law."&lt;ref name="bycon"&gt;[http://law.by/work/EnglPortal.nsf/6e1a652fbefce34ac2256d910056d559/d93bc51590cf7f49c2256dc0004601db?OpenDocument Constitution of the Republic of Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104000951/http://law.by/work/EnglPortal.nsf/6e1a652fbefce34ac2256d910056d559/d93bc51590cf7f49c2256dc0004601db?OpenDocument |date=2010-11-04 }}. Accessed on 5 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As per the [[Criminal Code of Belarus|Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus]], capital punishment can be imposed for the following acts:

*Launching or conducting [[War of aggression|aggressive war]] (Article 122, Part 2)
*Murder of a representative of a foreign state or international organisation in order to provoke international complications or war (Article 124, Part 2)
*International [[terrorism]] (Article 126)
*[[Genocide]] (Article 127)
*[[Crimes against humanity]] (Article 128)
*Application of [[weapons of mass destruction]] under international treaties of the Republic of Belarus (Article 134)
*Violation of the [[Laws of war|war laws and usage]] (Article 135, Part 3)
*[[Murder]] committed under aggravating circumstances (Article 139, Part 2)
*[[Terrorism]] (Article 289, Part 3)
*[[Treason]] connected with murder (Article 356, Part 2)
*[[Revolution|Conspiracy to seize state power]] (Article 357, Part 3)
*Terrorist acts (Article 359)
*[[Sabotage]] (Article 360, Part 2)
*Murder of a [[police officer]] (Article 362)&lt;ref name="belarusembassy.org"&gt;

Most of the death penalty convictions were for murder committed under aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref name="mvd02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mvd.gov.by/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1375|script-title=ru:Смертная казнь|accessdate=2007-11-03|publisher=BrestOnline|date=2002-11-06|author=газете «Труд-7» |language=Russian}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Court proceedings involving capital cases must involve a "collegial consideration," consisting of one judge and two People's assessors. The People's assessors are chosen from the general population, similar to the [[jury]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncpi.gov.by/constsud/eng/d114.htm |title=DECISION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS OF 17.04.2001 No. D-114/2001 |accessdate=2008-03-11 |date=2001-04-17 |publisher=Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006165746/http://ncpi.gov.by/constsud/eng/d114.htm |archivedate=2007-10-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the number of offenses eligible for the death penalty and the type of convicts eligible for it have been reduced. In 1993 four [[economic crime]]s that would have resulted in death sentences during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era were removed from the list of capital offenses by a vote of parliament and were replaced by prison terms without parole.&lt;ref name="aibyuz"&gt;"[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR040092004?open&amp;of=ENG-BLR Belarus and Uzbekistan: the last executioners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525235703/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR040092004?open&amp;of=ENG-BLR |date=2005-05-25 }}." [[Amnesty International]]. Accessed on 5 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the total number of categories of crime qualifying for capital punishment declined during this time, Presidential Decree No. 21, issued on 21 October 1997, added "terrorism" to the list of capital offenses.&lt;ref name="ai491797"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR490171997?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU |title=Belarus: Findings of Human Rights Committee confirm worsening human rights situation |accessdate=2007-11-03 |date=1997-11-10 |author=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060401104144/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR490171997?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU |archivedate=April 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Criminal Code was updated in 1999, the number of capital offenses was further reduced. This reduction was assisted by the introduction of [[life imprisonment]] in December 1997.&lt;ref name="byemb"/&gt;

Since March 1, 1994, women are ineligible for capital punishment and persons under the age of 18 at the time of the crime or over 65 at the time of sentencing have been exempt from capital punishment since January 2001.&lt;ref name="bycode"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.levonevski.net/pravo/kodeksy/uk/009.html|script-title=ru:Уголовный кодекс Республики Беларусь|accessdate=2007-11-03|date=2006-04-02|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are [[mentally ill]] may have their death sentence commuted.&lt;ref name="belarusembassy.org"/&gt; Under Article 84 of the Constitution, the [[President of Belarus|president]] "may grant [[pardon]]s to convicted citizens".&lt;ref name="bycon"/&gt; From June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2005, President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] granted two pardons to death row inmates and denied one such request.&lt;ref name="byemb"/&gt;

In 2000 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] condemned ''"in the strongest possible terms the executions in Belarus and deplores the fact that Belarus is currently the only country in Europe where the death penalty is enforced and, moreover, is regularly and widely enforced".&lt;ref&gt;Legisltationline.org [http://www.legislationline.org/?jid=7&amp;less=false&amp;tid=144 Death Penalty – Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182742/http://www.legislationline.org/?jid=7&amp;less=false&amp;tid=144 |date=2007-09-27 }}. Published November 2004. Retrieved May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;''

Belarus is the only European country to have carried out executions in the [[21st century]]. European Council members suggested in 2001 that Belarus abolish capital punishment before it can apply for membership in the Council.&lt;ref name="brestonline"/&gt; Belarus (as the [[Byelorussian SSR]]) signed the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. [http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4.htm Signatory nations of the ICCPR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223320/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |date=2007-09-26 }}. Retrieved May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This convention, however, does not abolish the death penalty, but it imposes certain conditions on its implementation and use.

==Method==
Before execution all prisoners on [[death row]] are transferred to [[Minsk Detention Center No. 1]] (СИЗО, or [[SIZO No. 1]]), in the country's capital [[Minsk]].&lt;ref name="unchhr"/&gt; The method used to carry out the sentence is [[execution by shooting]].&lt;ref name="mvd02"/&gt;  The executioner is a member of the "committee for the execution of sentences," which also chooses the area where the execution will take place.&lt;ref name="unchhr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2b1c441baa682a5fc1256d250036448c?Opendocument|title=Communication No 887/1999 : Belarus. 24/04/2003|accessdate=2007-11-03|publisher=United Nations Organization|date=2003-04-24|author=Human Rights Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''The Death Squad'' by [[Oleg Alkayev]] ([[:ru:Алкаев, Олег Леонидович|Олег Алкаев]]), on the day of execution the convict is transported to a secret location where he is told by officials that all appeals have been rejected. The convict is then blindfolded and taken to a nearby room, where two staffers force him to kneel in front of a bullet backstop. The executioner then shoots the convict in the back of his head with a [[PB (pistol)|PB-9 pistol]] equipped with a suppressor. According to Alkayev, "The whole procedure, starting with the announcement about denied appeals and ending with the gunshot, lasts no longer than two minutes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/13/ap/world/main5381578.shtml Gypsy Laborer Faces Execution In Belarus] CBS News, October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sentence is carried out, a prison doctor and other officials certify that the execution has been performed and a [[death certificate]] is prepared. The remains of the condemned are buried secretly, and the family is notified that the execution has taken place.&lt;ref name="mvd02"/&gt; Col. Oleg Alkayev, who was a director of SIZO No. 1, claimed that about 130 executions took place at the prison between December 1996 and May 2001, when he left Belarus to live in exile in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="alkayev"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.santegidio.org/pdm/news/29_08_01.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020116232848/http://www.santegidio.org/pdm/news/29_08_01.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-01-16|title=Belarus Executioner Accuses President of Murder|accessdate=2007-11-03|publisher=Reuters|date=2001-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] issued the following opinion of the execution process in Belarus after the mother of subsequently executed prisoner Anton Bondarenko petitioned the Committee to spare her son's life: "[the process has] the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress…[and that the] authorities’ initial failure to notify the author of the scheduled date for the execution of her son, and their subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son’s grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the author, in violation of article 7 of the Covenant [prohibiting torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]."&lt;ref name="schedko"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/399cc6c62d92bbcec1256d33004d5600?Opendocument|title=Communication No 886/1999 : Belarus. 28/04/2003|accessdate=2007-11-17|publisher=United Nations|year=2003|author=Human Rights Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of executions ==
The following is a rough estimate of number of executions carried out since 1985, as per Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD):
*1985&amp;nbsp;– 21&amp;nbsp;– Byelorussian SSR
*1986&amp;nbsp;– 10
*1987&amp;nbsp;– 12
*1988&amp;nbsp;– 12

The exact number of people executed in Belarus is not known, since the last documents released by the Belarusian Government were in 2006.&lt;ref name="ihf06"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2006/10/21160_en.pdf|title=IHF Intervention to the 2006 OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting|accessdate=2007-11-17|year=2006|author=International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, other sources, notably BelaPAN, have published somewhat different data.  BelaPAN, the abbreviation for "Беларускае прыватнае агентства навiн" (Belarusian Private News Agency), records 278 executions from 1992 to 2010 with two additional men under death sentence in September 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kania, Richard R. E., and Lyuba Pervushina, “The Death Penalty in Belarus,” paper for the Southern Criminal Justice Association 2010 Annual Meeting, Clearwater Beach, Florida&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some of the practices of the MVD, such as the non-disclosure of the graves of the executed, this is a violation of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] protocol to make information about capital punishment open to the public.&lt;ref name="oscedp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2004/02/2159_en.pdf|title=OSCE Comments on the Death Penalty|accessdate=2007-11-17|publisher=Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|year=1994|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
In a [[Belarusian referendum, 1996|1996 referendum]], one of the seven questions asked was about abolishing the death penalty. According to the results of this referendum, 80.44% of Belarusians were against abolition.&lt;ref name="96refresult"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rec.gov.by/refer/ref1996resdoc.html|script-title=ru:Центральной комиссии Республики Беларусь по выборам и проведению республиканских референдумов|accessdate=2007-11-17|year=1996|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019005232/http://rec.gov.by/refer/ref1996resdoc.html|archivedate=2007-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time of the referendum, the longest available prison sentence was 15 years. Since then the sentence of lifelong imprisonment was introduced (in December 1997). There have not been more recent surveys to determine whether the change in maximum prison sentence affected public sentiment about the death penalty.&lt;ref name="aibyuz"/&gt;

More recently a parliamentary special working group announced plans to conduct a public opinion poll, but the Information and Analytical Center with the Administration of the President took over this undertaking. The Center has released its report, “Public Opinion about the Activity of the Organs of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus,” which included the questions about death penalty and the attitudes of Belarusian citizens about abolition of capital punishment. That poll showed only 4.5% of the respondents were against capital punishment in all cases, 79.5% considered capital punishment appropriate punishment for at least some grave crimes and about 10% had difficulty answering these questions or offered no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Prudnikova, Olga (2010) “The Question Connected with Death Punishment Will Be Solved After the Elections?” Svobodnye Novosti Plus, 11.08.2010–18.08.2010, p. 12: (www.naviny.by)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several steps taken toward reducing the imposition of the death penalty in Belarus. The Law of the Republic of Belarus of 31 December 1997 added Article 22, which allows for “imprisonment for the term of one’s life (life imprisonment) as an alternative to capital punishment.”  Capital punishment has also since been restricted to men between the age of 18 and 65.&lt;ref&gt;Kadushkin, S. (2002) “Death Penalty and Its Alternative in the Legislation of the Republic of Belarus,” Yustitsiya of Belarus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court cases ==
On March 11, 2004, the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus]] came to the conclusion that two articles of the Criminal Code were incompatible with the [[Constitution of Belarus]]. The Court stated that either the President or the National Assembly could make the decision to suspend or completely abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncpi.gov.by/ConstSud/eng/j171.htm Judgment of the Constitutional Court of March 11, 2004] On the conformity between the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, the international treaties to which the Republic of Belarus is a party and the provisions of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus stipulating application of the death penalty as a punishment, accessed on May 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in October 2005,  the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Criminal Code declaring that the continued use of the death penalty was on a temporary basis only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charter97.org/eng/news/2005/10/27/uk Belarus amends criminal code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185342/http://www.charter97.org/eng/news/2005/10/27/uk |date=2007-09-30 }} Interfax on October 26, 2005, accessed on May 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first [[Amish]] settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in the mid-1700s.&lt;ref name=pennlive&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic disease is ravaging Lancaster County's Amish, and helping to change medicine for all of us | url=https://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/02/genetic_disease_is_ravaging_la.html| accessdate = 2018-11-16 | work = Penn Live |date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Establishment==
The Clinic for Special Children was founded by Dr. D. Holmes Morton and his wife, Caroline in 1989.&lt;ref name=wpost /&gt;  Morton's interest in the region and its inhabitants was started after he diagnosed a 6 year old boy with [[glutaric acidemia type I]] (GA1), an inherited disorder of lysine metabolism.  After establishing the initial diagnosis, Morton quickly went on to identify 16 more affected individuals in the same region, with the same disorder.&lt;ref name=pennlive /&gt;  Prior to the identification of this patient cohort, GA1 had been described in only eight patients worldwide.&lt;ref name=wpost /&gt;  The clinic building was [[barn raising|raised]] by the community and completed in 1990.&lt;ref name=clinichistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History &amp; Mission |url=https://clinicforspecialchildren.org/who-we-are/historymission/|accessdate = 2018-11-16 | publisher= Clinic for Special Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to patient care facilities, the Clinic also houses its own laboratory, providing [[biochemical genetics|biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular]] genetic testing for the region.&lt;ref name=clinichistory /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">'''Dimitrie Voinov''' (June 25, 1867 – July 7, 1951) was a [[Romania]]n [[Zoology|zoologist]], [[Histology|histologist]] and [[Cell biology|cytologist]].

Born in [[Iași]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1890, going on to earn a doctorate. He extensively studied insect orders such as [[Coleoptera]] and [[Lepidoptera]]. His investigations into reproduction focused on studying the shape and structure of sperm cells. He also looked at the components of cytoplasm, including mitochondria and vacuoles.&lt;ref name="budulache"&gt;{{ro icon}} Raluca Budulache, [http://www.cesec.ro/pdf/Biologia_forma_culturii_A5_Final.pdf "Repere ale istoriei Facultăţii de Biologie a Universităţii din Bucureşti"], in ''Biologia ca formă a culturii'' (ed. Virgil Iordache), p.19. Editura Ars Docendi, University of Bucharest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-973-558-380-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his over fifty scientific works published domestically and abroad are one on the "Principles of Microscopy" (Bucharest, 1900); another on spermatogenesis in ''[[Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa]]'' (Paris, 1912) and a third on the [[Golgi apparatus]] in nerve cells (Paris, 1929). Between 1892 and 1939, he was a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]]'s morphology and zoology faculty,&lt;ref name="budulache"/&gt; becoming a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="budulache"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=V Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent], at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania]]n authorities allowed him to remain as an "honorary titular member". Following a road accident, he died three years later at the hospital in [[Găești]].&lt;ref&gt;''Natura: Seria biologie'', Vol. 19, p.89, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms may include [[fever]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]], along with typical viral symptoms of [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]], [[lymphadenopathy|enlarged lymph nodes]], [[sore throat]], and possibly [[encephalitis|brain inflammation]]. The rash may appear at any time during the illness. It is usually generalised. The rash consists of [[erythematous]] [[maculopapules]] with areas of [[Confluency|confluence]]. They may be [[urticarial]], [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]], or sometimes [[petechial]]. The palms and soles may be involved. The eruptions are more common in children than in adults. Usually, the [[rash]] fades without [[pigmentation]] or scaling.

'''Ebenezer McBurney Byers''' (April 12, 1880 – March 31, 1932) was a wealthy American [[socialite]], [[Sportsperson|athlete]], and [[Business magnate|industrialist]]. He won the 1906 [[U.S. Amateur]] in golf. He earned notoriety in the early 1930s when he died from multiple radiation-induced cancers after consuming [[Radithor]], a popular [[patent medicine]] made from [[radium]] dissolved in [[water]].

==Biography==
[[File:Eben Byers in 1920s.jpg|thumb|Eben Byers in the 1920s]]
The son of industrialist Alexander Byers, Eben Byers was educated at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] and [[Yale College]],&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{cite book |last=Leonard |first=John William |title=Who's Who in Finance and Banking |publisher=Who's Who in Finance Inc |year=1922 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he earned a reputation as an athlete and ladies' man. He was the [[U.S. Amateur]] golf champion of 1906, after finishing runner-up in 1902&lt;ref name="1902 US Amateur"&gt;{{cite news |title=Travis Out Of The Race |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1902-07-18/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1902&amp;index=5&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Herbert+Tweedie&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1902&amp;proxtext=Herbert+Tweedie&amp;y=9&amp;x=13&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |newspaper=New York Tribune |page=5 |date=July 18, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1903.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wade |first1=Don |last2=McCord |first2=Gary |title=And Then Arnie Told Chi Chi... |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |pages=33–4 |isbn=0-8092-3549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers eventually became the chairman of the Girard Iron Company, which had been created by his father.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt;

In 1927, while returning via chartered train from the annual [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|Harvard–Yale football game]], Byers fell from his [[Berth (sleeping)|berth]] and injured his arm. He complained of persistent pain and a doctor suggested that he take [[Radithor]], a [[patent medicine]] manufactured by [[William J. A. Bailey]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743525,00.html |title=Radium Drinks |date=April 11, 1932 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey was a [[Harvard University]] dropout who falsely claimed to be a doctor of medicine and had become rich from the sale of Radithor. Bailey created Radithor by dissolving radium in water to high concentrations, claiming it could cure many ailments by stimulating the [[endocrine system]]. He offered physicians a 17% rebate on the prescription of each dose of Radithor.&lt;ref name=fda&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.alleghenycemetery.com/images/newsletter/newsletter_XIII_1.pdf | title=Eben M. Byers: The Effect of Gamma Rays on Amateur Golf, Modern Medicine and the FDA | date=Fall 2004 | work=Allegheny Cemetery Heritage | accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byers began taking enormous doses of Radithor, which he believed had greatly improved his health, drinking nearly 1,400 bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofquackery.com/devices/radium.htm |title=Radium Cures |publisher=museumofquackery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, when Byers stopped taking the remedy, he had accumulated significant amounts of radium in his bones resulting in the loss of most of his jaw. Byers' [[brain abscess|brain was also abscessed]], and holes were forming in his skull. His death on March 31, 1932, was attributed to "radiation poisoning" using the terminology of the time, but it was due to cancers, not [[acute radiation syndrome]].&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death Stirs Action on Radium 'Cures'.

==Legacy==
Due to Byers' prominence, his death received much publicity. After his death, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ran a headline reading "The Radium Water Worked Fine until His Jaw Came Off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/06/09/343948/index.htm |title=A Little Poison Can Be Good For You The received wisdom about toxins and radiation may be all wet |last=Stipp |first=David |date=June 9, 2003 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.23.10.1017-b | title = Radium Poisoning a Review of Present Knowledge * | year = 1933 | last1 = Evans | first1 = Robley D. | journal = American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1017| pmc = 1558329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His illness and eventual death also led to a heightened awareness of the dangers of ingesting radioactive materials, and to the adoption of laws that increased the powers of the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;

William Bailey was never tried for Byers' death, although the [[Federal Trade Commission]] issued an order against his business. However this did not stop Bailey from trading in radioactive products. He later founded a new company – "Radium Institute", in New York – and marketed a radioactive belt-clip, a radioactive paperweight, and a mechanism which made water radioactive.&lt;ref name='deadly'&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvie |first=David I. |title=Deadly Sunshine: The History and Fatal Legacy of Radium |publisher=Tempus Publishing Limited |year=2005 |edition=1 |pages=160–161 |isbn=0-7524-3395-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency medical services ('''Скорая Медицинская Помощь - "Urgent Medical Aid"''') in Russia is a type of medical assistance provided to citizens in cases of accident, illnesses, injuries, poisonings, and other conditions requiring urgent medical intervention. These services are typically provided by a city or regional government, public emergency hospital, or the Disaster Medical Service. The emergency number for dialing an ambulance in Russia is 03 or the generic European 112. 


== Overview ==

=== Staffing ===
An ambulance is composed of any combination of doctors, nurses and feldshers (a combination of a physicians assistant and paramedic), with ambulance drivers selected from an agency that trains them as professional drivers. Ambulances are staffed at minimum by a nurse and feldsher. The driver is simply that-a driver with no medical or even specialized driver's training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jems.com/articles/2007/11/russian-way.html|title=The Russian Way|website=www.jems.com|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== System configuration ==

=== Ambulance Types ===
Class 1 - A non-emergency patient transport vehicle used to shuttle patients between hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities. 

Class 2 - A generic emergency ambulance staffed with feldshers trained and operating in Basic Life Support (BLS).

Class 3 - Specialty Ambulance. In addition to the basic ambulance teams, various types of specialty units can respond, depending on what advanced patient care is needed. The most common is a "reanimobil", or a "resuscitation ambulance". These are Advanced Life Support (ALS) units that respond to cardiac arrest, stroke, severe trauma, and other severe medical emergencies. Other types of specialty ambulances include cardiac, surgical, OB, pediatric, intensive care, and respiratory. All of these units carry state-of-the-art equipment, a specialty emergency physician, and some combination of a feldsher and nurse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emsworld.com/article/10323164/comrades-arms|title=Comrades in Arms {{!}} EMS World|website=www.emsworld.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These specialty ambulances are typically painted yellow to distinguish them from the generic white emergency ambulances.

=== Other Emergency Services ===
Rescue Service - А technical rescue brigade provided by a city or regional government or EMERCOM depending on location. These units respond to motor vehicle accidents, building collapses, water rescues, and rope rescue situations. The teams extricate or rescue the victim from the dangerous situation, stabilize the victim, and hand them over to the ambulance.

The '''European Public Health Association''' ('''EUPHA''') is an umbrella organisation for [[public health]] associations and institutes in [[Europe]]. EUPHA is an international, multidisciplinary, scientific organisation, bringing together around 14’000 public health experts for professional exchange and collaboration throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eupha.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Its central office is based at the NIVEL (Nederlands instituut voor onderzoek van de gezondheidszorg) in [[Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nivel.nl/oc2/page.asp?PageID=8621&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
EUPHA was founded in 1992 by 15 members (12 countries). EUPHA’s mission is to facilitate and activate a strong voice of the public health network by enhancing visibility of the evidence and by strengthening the capacity of public health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scopemed.org/fulltextpdf.php?mno=175048&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
In November 2014, EUPHA Governing Board approved a new 2014-2020 strategy. According to the new strategy, EUPHA has three main objectives:
# To be a leading scientific and independent voice in the field of public health and health services research and policy;
# To build capacity and knowledge in the field of public health and health services research with the aim of supporting evidence-informed practice and policy decisions; and
# To prepare future generations of engaged and connected public health professionals for their leadership role in public health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ejmanager.com/fulltextpdf.php?mno=175048&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
EUPHA has two sorts of membership: full membership, which is open for national public health associations in Europe (WHO/EURO definition of Europe) and the associate membership, open for individuals, international [[NGO]]s and public health institutions. In 2014, EUPHA has 71 members from 40 countries:
*41 national associations of public health 
*18 institutional members 
*8 European NGOs 
*4 individual members

==Organizational components==

===Structure===
EUPHA is a member-based organization. The members are represented in the Governing Board, which is responsible for approving the annual report on the activities of the Executive Council, the annual financial report, the work plan and budget for the coming year, as presented by the Executive Council, and the decision to create, dissolve, merge or split EUPHA sections. The Executive Council is charged with the management of the association and is assisted by EUPHA office.

===Sections===
EUPHA encourages the creation of sections for specific public health themes, which are international and open to all public health professionals. The goal is to bring together researchers, policymakers and practitioners working in the same field for knowledge sharing and capacity building. At the moment EUPHA has 19 operational sections and one proposed section:
*Child and adolescent public health
*Chronic diseases
*Environment related disease
*Ethics in public health
*Food and nutrition
*Health impact assessment
*Health promotion
*Health services research
*Health technology assessment
*Infectious diseases control
*Injury prevention and safety promotion
*Migrant and ethnic minority health
*Public health economics
*Public health epidemiology
*Public health genomics
*Public health monitoring and reporting
*Public health practice and policy
*Public mental health
*Social security and health
*Urban public health

===Pillars===
In order to better support the activities of EUPHA and to include all aspects of public health, EUPHA has created four pillars to link EUPHA sections and EUPHA members. These pillars reflect the four working areas of public health: research, policy, practice and training and education.

===EUPHAnxt===
EUPHAnxt is a network for students, young researchers, policymakers and professionals in the field of public health. The special EUPHAnxt subscriber status is accessible for all those under 35 years old. The aim of this initiative is to sensitize and involve students, young researchers, practitioners and policymakers interested in European public health issues into the European and multidisciplinary network of public health associations. In July 2014, EUPHAnxt has around 800 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eupha.org/site/projects.php?project_page=9&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Public Health Conference==
EUPHA has been organising annual scientific conferences since 1992. The first conference was held in [[Paris]] in December 1992. Since 2008 the annual conference name was changed to "European Public Health Conference", as the conferences are a joint effort with national public health associations and international partners. In 2014, the 7th European Public Health Conference "Mind the gap: Reducing inequalities in health and health care" took place in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, UK, from 19 to 22 November. The 8th European Public Health Conference "Health in Europe – from global to local: policies, methods and practices" will be held in [[Milan]], Italy from 14 to 17 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ephconference.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===''European Journal of Public Health''===
{{Main|European Journal of Public Health}}
EUPHA publishes a bi-monthly scientific journal together with [[Oxford University Press]]. The ''European Journal of Public Health'' is a multidisciplinary journal in the field of public health, publishing contributions from [[social medicine]], [[epidemiology]], [[health services research]], management, ethics and law, [[health economics]], social sciences and [[environmental health]]. The EJPH is published bimonthly. The journal provides a forum for discussion and debate of current international public health issues with a focus on the European region. In 2013, the [[impact factor]] of the journal increased to 2.516 (5-yr impact factor: 2.928).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/eurpub/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''fallopian tubes''', also known as '''uterine tubes''' or '''salpinges''' (''singular'' '''salpinx''') are [[uterine appendages]], lined from inside with [[simple columnar epithelium#Ciliated|ciliated simple columnar epithelium]], leading from the [[ovary|ovaries]] of [[female mammal]]s into the [[uterus]], via the [[uterotubal junction]]. They enable the passage of [[egg cell]]s from the ovaries to the uterus. In non-mammalian [[vertebrate]]s, the equivalent structures are called [[oviduct]]s.

==Structure==
Its different segments are ({{wt|en|lateral}} near the [[ovary|ovaries]] to {{wt|en|medial}} near the [[uterus]]): the [[Infundibulum of uterine tube|infundibulum]] with its associated [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbriae]] near the ovary, the [[Ampulla of Fallopian tube|ampullary]] region that represents the major portion of the lateral tube, the '''isthmus''' the visible medial third segment which is the narrower part of the tube that links to the uterus, and the interstitial (also known as intramural) part that transverses the uterine musculature.  The [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]] is the point where the tubal canal meets the peritoneal cavity, while the uterine opening of the fallopian tube is the entrance into the [[uterine cavity]], the uterotubal junction.

===Microanatomy===
A cross-section of a fallopian tube shows four distinct layers, from outer to inner: [[serosa]], [[subserosa]], [[lamina propria]] and innermost [[mucosa]]l. The serosa is derived from visceral [[peritoneum]]. Subserosa is composed of loose adventitious tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, an outer longitudinal and inner circular [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] coats. This layer is responsible for the [[peristaltic]] action of the fallopian tubes. Lamina propria is a vascular connective tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Daftary, Shirish; Chakravarti, Sudip (2011). Manual of Obstetrics, 3rd Edition. Elsevier. pp. 1-16. {{ISBN|9788131225561}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner layer is a single layer of [[simple columnar epithelium]]. The columnar cells have microscopic hair-like filaments ([[cilia]]) predominately throughout the tube, but are most numerous in the infundibulum and ampulla. [[Estrogen]] increases the production of cilia on these cells. Between the ciliated cells are [[peg cells]], which contain apical granules and produce the tubular fluid.  This fluid contains nutrients for [[spermatozoa]], [[oocytes]], and [[zygotes]]. The secretions also promote [[capacitation]] of the sperm by removing [[glycoprotein]]s and other molecules from the plasma membrane of the sperm. [[Progesterone]] increases the number of peg cells, while estrogen increases their height and secretory activity.  Tubal fluid flows against the action of the cilia, that is toward the fimbrial end.

In view of longitudinal variation in histological features of tube, the isthmus has thick muscular coat and simple mucosal folds; whereas ampulla has complex mucosal folds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Clarify|date=July 2013}}

===Development===
[[Embryo]]s have two pairs of ducts to let [[gamete]]s out of the body; one pair (the [[Müllerian duct]]s) develops in females into the fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]], while the other pair (the [[Wolffian duct]]s) develops in males into the [[epididymis]] and vas deferens.

Normally, only one of the pairs of tubes will develop while the other regresses and disappears ''in utero''.

The homologous organ in the male is the rudimentary [[appendix testis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Function==

===Fertilization===
The tube allows passage of the egg from the ovary to the uterus. When an [[ovum|oocyte]] is developing in an ovary, it is encapsulated in a spherical collection of cells known as an [[ovarian follicle]]. Just prior to ovulation the primary oocyte completes meiosis I to form the first polar body and a secondary oocyte which is arrested in metaphase of meiosis II.  This secondary oocyte is then ovulated. The follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the secondary oocyte [[ovulation|to escape]]. The secondary oocyte is caught by the fimbriated end and travels to the ampulla of the uterine tube where typically the sperm are met and [[fertilization]] occurs; meiosis II is promptly completed. The fertilized ovum, now a [[zygote]], travels towards the uterus aided by activity of tubal cilia and activity of the tubal muscle. The early embryo requires critical development in the fallopian tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=S|last2=Winuthayanon|first2=W|title=Oviduct: roles in fertilization and early embryo development.|journal=The Journal of Endocrinology|date=January 2017|volume=232|issue=1|pages=R1-R26|doi=10.1530/JOE-16-0302|pmid=27875265|url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/232/1/R1.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; After about five days the new [[embryo]] enters the uterine cavity and on about the sixth day [[Implantation (human embryo)|implants]] on the wall of the uterus.

The release of an oocyte does not alternate between the two ovaries and seems to be random. After removal of an ovary, the remaining one produces an egg every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/biology_of_the_female_reproductive_system/menstrual_cycle.html |title=Menstrual Cycle: Biology of the Female Reproductive System: Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |publisher=Merck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the embryo implants into the fallopian tube instead of the [[uterus]], creating an [[ectopic pregnancy]], commonly known as a "tubal pregnancy".

==Clinical significance==

===Patency testing===
While a full testing of tubal functions in patients with [[infertility]] is not possible, testing of tubal patency is important as [[tubal obstruction]] is a major cause of infertility.  A [[hysterosalpingogram]], [[laparoscopy]] and dye, or [[HyCoSy]] (hysterocontrast sonography) will demonstrate that tubes are open. [[Tubal insufflation]] is a standard procedure for testing patency. During surgery the condition of the tubes may be inspected and a dye such as [[methylene blue]] can be injected into the uterus and shown to pass through the tubes when the [[cervix]] is occluded. As tubal disease is often related to ''[[Chlamydia infection]]'', testing for [[Chlamydia antibodies]] has become a cost-effective screening device for tubal pathology.&lt;ref name=coog&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kodaman PH, Arici A, Seli E | title=Evidence-based diagnosis and management of tubal factor infertility. |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |pmid=15129051|volume=16|issue=3|date=June 2004|pages=221–9|doi=10.1097/00001703-200406000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflammation===
{{Main|Salpingitis}}
[[Salpingitis]] is inflammation of the fallopian tubes and may be found alone, or be a component of [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID). A thickening of  the fallopian tube at its narrow portion, due to inflammation, is known as [[salpingitis isthmica nodosa]]. Like [[pelvic inflammatory disease|PID]] and [[endometriosis]], it may lead to [[fallopian tube obstruction]]. Fallopian tube obstruction is associated with [[infertility]] and [[ectopic pregnancy]].

===Cancer===
{{Main|Fallopian tube cancer}}
[[Fallopian tube cancer]], which typically arises from the [[epithelial]] lining of the fallopian tube, has historically been considered to be a very rare malignancy. Recent evidence suggests it probably represents a significant portion of what has been classified as [[ovarian cancer]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hirst | first1 = JE. | last2 = Gard | first2 = GB. | last3 = McIllroy | first3 = K. | last4 = Nevell | first4 = D. | last5 = Field | first5 = M. | title = High rates of occult fallopian tube cancer diagnosed at prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. | journal = Int J Gynecol Cancer | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 826–9 |date=Jul 2009 | doi = 10.1111/IGC.0b013e3181a1b5dc | PMID = 19574767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While tubal cancers may be misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer, it is of little consequence as the treatment of both ovarian and fallopian tube cancer is similar.

===Surgery===
[[File:Fallopian Tube Surgical Procedures.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Locations of some surgical procedures]]
The surgical removal of a fallopian tube is called a [[salpingectomy]]. To remove both tubes is a bilateral salpingectomy. An operation that combines the removal of a fallopian tube with removal of at least one ovary is a [[Oophorectomy|salpingo-oophorectomy]]. An operation to remove a fallopian tube obstruction is called a [[tuboplasty]].

=== Other ===
The fallopian tube can [[pelvic organ prolapse|prolapse]] into the vagina and can be mistaken for a [[neoplasm|tumour]]. This usually happens after a hysterectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Benign%20Neoplasms%20of%20the%20Vagina/item/5|title=Benign Neoplasms of the Vagina {{!}} GLOWM|website=www.glowm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
They are named after their discoverer, the 16th century [[Italy|Italian]] anatomist [[Gabriele Falloppio]], who thought they resembled [[tuba]]s, the plural of ''{{lang|it|tuba}}'' in Italian being ''{{lang|it|tube}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A Medley of Maladies |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/qi/episodes/13/1/ |access-date=2 July 2017 |series=QI |series-link=QI |station=[[BBC Two]] |date=16 October 2015 |series-no=M |number=1 |minutes=0:38:37 |transcript=Transcript from Subsaga.com |transcript-url=https://subsaga.com/bbc/comedy/qi-xl/series-m/1-a-medley-of-maladies.html#transcript |quote=He thought they reminded him of what were in those days rather long musical instruments with an end like a trumpet's bell, these were tubas. And so he called them ''tubas''. And if you have a tuba, if you have a word ending in A in Italian, how do you pluralise it? What is two ''tuba''? ... ''Tube''. With an E on the end, spelled T-U-B-E. So, when it went around the world as his ''tube'', his ''tubas'', people saw the word ''tube''. But, in fact, he had called them ''tubas''. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the name ''Fallopian tube'' is eponymous, it is often spelt with a lower case ''f'' from the assumption that the adjective ''fallopian'' has been absorbed into modern English as the ''{{lang|la|de facto}}'' name for the structure.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}{{tone inline|date=July 2018}}

Its headquarters is located in [[Tallahassee, Florida]] and it has 90 local offices. Programs include Deaf/Hard of Hearing Services, Ticket to Work, Transition Youth, Mental Health, and Supported Employment.

==Program descriptions==

Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services ensure that VR services are provided to eligible individuals with all types of hearing loss. Necessary assistance and skills training for both employee and employer can help persons who are deaf or hard of hearing secure and retain employment. 

Ticket to Work is a Social Security Administration (SSA) program available to Floridians. For those who qualify for social security benefits, tickets will be issued and may be taken to Employment Network (EN) participants, such as VR. These participants offer access to employment and rehabilitation services necessary to help a person secure and retain employment. This program is voluntary.[http://www.yourtickettowork.com/]

VR Transition Youth Services help students with disabilities train for a job, continue their education, or find a job after high school. Under this program, every youth will have the opportunity to participate in sponsored career counseling, work readiness training, and fully integrated work experiences in the community. These services are delivered while youth are still in high school and establish the foundation for a seamless transition to individualized training, education, and employment.

VR coordinates services with available mental health centers, programs, and service providers to assist individuals with mental or emotional disabilities in becoming employed.

Supported Employment serves people with the most significant disabilities who have not been successful in competitive employment. The program helps individuals become employed in their community by using services such as job coaching and follow-up to promote employment stability.[http://www.rehabworks.org/programs.shtml]

==History==

The national vocational rehabilitation movement began after World War I when war casualties set the stage for Vocational Rehabilitation legislation. The U.S. Congress realized that many soldiers disabled in the war would require special training to return to civilian occupations.

In 1918, Congress enacted the Soldier’s Rehabilitation Act to help veterans. However, the large number of people with disabilities from birth, accidents and work-related incidents that were in need of assistance stimulated Congress to pass the Smith-Fess Act of 1920. The act launched the civilian Vocational Rehabilitation program and provided funding to the states on 50/50 match. Vocational Rehabilitation evolved from a medical program serving veterans to an employment program that serves all disability populations. Florida’s Vocational Rehabilitation was established in 1925.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7286">'''Free-running sleep''' is a [[sleep]] pattern that is not adjusted ([[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrained]]) to the 24-hour cycle in nature nor to any artificial cycle.

It occurs as the [[sleep disorder]] [[non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder]] or artificially as part of experiments used in the study of [[circadian rhythms|circadian]] and other rhythms in [[biology]]. Study subjects are shielded from all time cues, often by a constant light [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]], by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light/dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light. Also, limited amounts of food may be made available at short intervals so as to avoid entrainment to mealtimes. Subjects are thus forced to live by their internal circadian "clocks".

==Background==
The individual's or animal's circadian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circadian system, the internal "body clock". The researcher can precisely determine, for example, the daily cycles of [[gene]]-activity, [[body temperature]], [[blood pressure]], [[hormone]] secretion and/or [[sleep]] and activity/[[alertness]]. Alertness in humans can be determined by many kinds of verbal and non-verbal tests; activity in animals by observation, for example of wheel-running in [[rodent]]s.

When animals or people ''free-run'', experiments can be done to see what sort of signals, known as [[zeitgeber]]s, are effective in entrainment. Also, much work has been done to see how long or short a circadian cycle to which different organisms can be entrained. For example, some animals can be entrained to a 22-hour day, but they can not be entrained to a 20-hour day. In recent studies funded by the U.S. space industry, it has been shown that most humans can be entrained to a 23.5-hour day and to a 24.65-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheer |first=Frank A.J.L. |author2=Kenneth P. Wright Jr. |author3=Richard E. Kronauer |author4=Charles A. Czeisler |date=2007-08-08 |title=Plasticity of the Intrinsic Period of the Human Circadian Timing System |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |pages=e721 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000721 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |quote=[E]xposure to moderately bright light (~450 lux; ~1.2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the second or first half of the scheduled wake episode is effective for entraining individuals to the 24.65-h Martian sol and a 23.5-h day length, respectively. |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000721 |pmid=17684566 |issue=1 |pmc=1934931 |editor1-last=Nicolelis |editor1-first=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of unintended time cues is called ''masking'' and can totally confound experimental results. Examples of masking are morning rush traffic audible to the subjects, or researchers or maintenance staff visiting subjects on a regular schedule.

==In humans==
[[Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder]], also referred to as ''free-running disorder'' (FRD) or ''Non-24'', is one of the [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]s in humans. It affects more than half&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Teofilo Lee-Chiong |title=Sleep: a comprehensive handbook |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=385 |isbn=0-471-68371-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; of people who are totally [[blindness|blind]] and a smaller number of sighted individuals.&lt;ref name=AASM&gt;[http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/301108.pdf An American Academy of Sleep Medicine Review: ''Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders: Part II, Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, Free-Running Disorder, and Irregular Sleep–Wake Rhythm.''] PDF, 18 pages. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among blind people, the cause is the inability to register, and therefore to entrain to, light cues. The many blind people who do entrain to the 24-hour light/dark cycle have eyes with functioning retinas including operative non-visual light-sensitive cells, [[ipRGCs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tu, D.C. |title=Physiologic diversity and development of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=987–99 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16364902 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.031 |quote=Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate numerous nonvisual phenomena, including entrainment of the circadian clock to light-dark cycles, pupillary light responsiveness, and light-regulated hormone release. |last2=Zhang |first2=D. |last3=Demas |first3=J. |display-authors=4 |last4=Slutsky |first4=Elon B. |last5=Provencio |first5=Ignacio |last6=Holy |first6=Timothy E. |last7=Van Gelder |first7=Russell N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s, which contain [[melanopsin]], convey their signals to the "circadian clock" via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (branching off from the [[optic nerve]]), linking the retina to the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Czeisler |first=Charles A. |author2=Theresa L.

Among sighted individuals, FRD usually first appears in the teens or early twenties. As with [[delayed sleep phase disorder]] (DSPS or DSPD), in the absence of neurological damage due to trauma or [[stroke]], cases almost never appear after the age of 30.&lt;ref name=AASM/&gt; FRD affects more sighted males than sighted females.&lt;ref name=AASM/&gt; A quarter of sighted individuals with FRD also have an associated psychiatric condition, and a quarter of them have previously shown symptoms of DSPS.&lt;ref name=AASM/&gt;

The term ''free-running sleep'' has occasionally been used by non-scientists to indicate intentional facilitation of the natural sleep/wake cycle. In this context, free-running sleep means that a person chooses to sleep when sleepy and to awaken spontaneously (specifically without an [[alarm clock]] or reference to the time of day).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7272">The '''Friends and Family Test''' was introduced into the [[English NHS]] in 2013.  It is a single question survey which asks patients whether they would recommend the NHS service they have received to friends and family who need similar treatment or care.

'''The friends and family question''': “We would like you to think about your experience in the ward where you spent the most time during this stay. How likely are you to recommend our ward to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?

Patients can answer as “extremely likely”; “likely”; “neither likely nor unlikely”; “unlikely”; “extremely unlikely”; or “don’t know”.

The Prime Minister announced on 25 May 2012 that the Friends and Family Test would be introduced across the NHS from April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Friends and Family Test|url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/pe/fft/|publisher=NHS England|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013 [[Francis Maude]] announced the Test would be extended across the NHS and other public services, including further education, [[Jobcentre Plus]] and the [[National Citizen Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release Friends and Family Test extended across public services|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/friends-and-family-test-extended-across-public-services|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication of the first results in September 2013, based on small numbers of responses, brought complaints that the test was giving a false picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurses raise concern friends and family test is alarming patients|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nurses-raise-concern-friends-and-family-test-is-alarming-patients/5062705.article|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Nursing Times|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also complaints about the methodology on the grounds that it is susceptible to too many uncontrolled variables for the result to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Friends and Family Test" – lessons from the "Do you masturbate often?" question|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/2013/07/31/the-friends-and-family-test-lessons-from-the-do-you-masturbate-often-question/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 [[IWantGreatCare]] formed a partnership with the [[NHS Alliance]] to set up a service which allows patients to rate and review doctors, hospitals and GP practices, and provide the Friends and Family test which all GPs will be required to provide from December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS Alliance forms partnership with iWantGreatCare|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/nhs-alliance-forms-partnership-with-iwantgreatcare#.Uo86K-Kevjw.twitter|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=national health executive|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2015 it had grown into the biggest ever collection of patient opinion in any health service anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five million items of feedback for Friends and Family Test|url=http://www.onmedica.com/newsarticle.aspx?id=cc383e00-a7a0-4471-8888-f4ea2be8d842|accessdate=16 June 2015|publisher=OnMedica|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The test has been criticised on a number of grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Sizmur S, Graham C, Walsh J: Influence of patients’ age and sex and the mode of administration on results from the NHS Friends and Family Test of patient experience.

BMC Health Services Research, 14, 499. doi:10.1186/s12913-014-0499-z&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 Dr Neil Bacon, chief executive of iWantGreatCare, denounced the implementation of the test, in particular NHS England’s refusal to enforce standardisation of methodology to ensure the data could be trusted and truly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The friends and family test is much more than a target|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/comment/the-friends-and-family-test-is-much-more-than-a-target/5067930.article#.UyQ_hoXBeU4|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research for the [[Care Quality Commission]] carried out by the [[Picker Institute]] in 2012 concluded that the test was “not appropriate for use in an NHS setting”.   One of the aims of the test is said to be to help patients make informed choices about healthcare providers (though many patients are in no position to make such a choice) and providers are given a rating score on the NHS Choices website.  However no explanation is provided  about what this rating means.  When tested on a group of undergraduate students none were able to accurately understand the meaning of the test headline score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are patients being heard? The friends and family test reviewed|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/home/innovation-and-efficiency/are-patients-being-heard-the-friends-and-family-test-reviewed/5071497.article#.U6BPwPldUqg|accessdate=17 June 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 it was announced that from April 2015 [[NHS trusts]] must collect free text comments from patients and collect demographic variables alongside the test data.  From December 2014 the test was rolled out to GP practices, and from January 2015, to mental health and community services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends and family test changes announced|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/friends-and-family-test-changes-announced/5073178.article#.VBs5_RLGBJ0|accessdate=18 September 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of responses collect by practices are small. In October 2015 5890 practices collected a total of 181,774 responses from patients - about one patient each day in each practice.  Results for each practice can vary wildly from month to month, making the scores very unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coulter|first1=Angela|title=A mixed bag of poorly evaluated methods leaves patients frustrated, and doctors little wiser|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i913|accessdate=26 February 2016|publisher=British Medical Journal|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] published an account from a patient who had suffered a miscarriage and described the use of text messaging in respect of the test as "crass and inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A&amp;E helped us through a miscarriage.

'''Ganirelix''' acetate (or diacetate), sold under the brand names '''Orgalutran''' and '''Antagon'''  among others, is an injectable competitive [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] antagonist ([[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist|GnRH antagonist]]). It is primarily used in [[Reproductive technology|assisted reproduction]] to control [[ovulation]]. The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]. Ganirelix is used in fertility treatment to prevent premature ovulation that could result in the harvesting of eggs that are too immature to be used in procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]].&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

[[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist|GnRH agonists]] are also sometimes used in reproductive therapy, as well as to treat disorders involving sex-steroid hormones, such as [[endometriosis]].&lt;ref name=One&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberyé|first=J|author2=Mannaerts, B |author3=Huisman, J |author4=Timmer, C |title=Local tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and dynamics of ganirelix (Orgalutran) administration by Medi-Jector compared to conventional needle injections.|journal=Human reproduction (Oxford, England)|date=February 2000|volume=15|issue=2|pages=245–9|pmid=10655292 |doi=10.1093/humrep/15.2.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of using GnRH antagonists is that repeated administration of GnRH agonists results in decreased levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids due to desensitization of the pituitary. This is avoided when using GnRH antagonists such as ganirelix.&lt;ref name=One /&gt; The success of ganirelix in reproductive therapy has been shown to be comparable to that when using GnRH agonists.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

==Medical uses==
Ganirelix is used as a fertility treatment drug for women. Specifically, it is used to prevent premature ovulation in women undergoing fertility treatment involving [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. When such premature ovulation occurs, the eggs released by the ovaries may be too immature to be used in ''in-vitro'' fertilization. Ganirelix prevents ovulation until it is triggered by injecting [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] (hCG).&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

Ganirelix is administered by a subcutaneous injection of 250&amp;nbsp;µg once per day during the mid to late follicular phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. Treatment should start on the 5th or 6th day after the start of ovarian stimulation, and the mean duration for its use is five days.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt; Preferably, the subcutaneous injections are delivered in the upper leg, and the patient can be trained to do this herself. Continued use of the drug should take place until the administration of hCG begins. hCG administration is begun when a sufficient number of follicles have developed due to the effects of endogenous and or exogenously administered follicle stimulating hormone.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

==Contraindications==
Ganirelix should not be used in women who are already pregnant, and because of this the onset of pregnancy must be ruled out before it is administered. Women using ganirelix should not breast feed, as it is not known whether ganirelix is excreted in breast milk.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

==Side effects==
Clinical studies have shown that the most common side effect is a slight reaction at the site of injection in the form of redness, and sometimes swelling.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt; Clinical studies have shown that, one hour after injection, the incidence of at least one moderate or severe local skin reaction per treatment cycle was 12% in 4 patients treated with ganirelix and 25% in patients treated subcutaneously with a GnRH agonist. The local reactions generally disappear within 4 hours after administration.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;
Other reported side effects are some that are known to be associated with ovarian hyperstimulation, including gynecological abdominal pain, headache, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and gastrointestinal abdominal pain. In some rare cases, less than 1 user in 10,000, hypersensitivity to ganirelix can cause anaphylactoid reactions, most likely due to allergy.&lt;ref name=Label /&gt;

===Birth defects===
A follow-up analysis for ganirelix done by the Marketing Authorisation Holder compared the number of congenital malformations between individuals whose mothers were treated with ganirelix compared with individuals whose mothers were treated with a GnRH agonist. The total number of congenital malformations was higher in the ganirelix group than in the GnRH agonist group (7.6% vs. 5.5%).&lt;ref name=discussion&gt;{{cite web|last=European Medicines Agency|title=Orgalutran : EPAR – Scientific Discussion|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/includes/document/document_detail.jsp?webContentId=WC500049537&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058009a3dc|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This falls within the range for the normal incidence of congenital malformations, and current data do not suggest that ganirelix increases the incidence of congenital malformations or anomalies. No important differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage were noted with the use of ganirelix.&lt;ref name=discussion /&gt;

==Interactions==
Currently, no studies have been done to assess the possible drug-drug interactions between ganirelix and other drugs.&lt;ref name=discussion /&gt;

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Ganierlix is a synthetic peptide that works as an antagonist against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) ("Ganirelix acetate injection," 2009). Ganirelix competitively blocks GnRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotroph, quickly resulting in the suppression of gonadotropin secretion.&lt;ref name=Label /&gt; This suppression is easily reversed by discontinuation of ganirelix administration. Ganirelix has a significantly higher receptor binding affinity (Kd = 0.4 nM) than GnRH (Kd = 3.6 nM).&lt;ref name=ema&gt;{{cite web|last=European Medicines Agency|title=Orgalutran|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000274/human_med_000960.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===
When ganirelix is given to healthy adult females, steady-state serum concentrations are reached, on average, after three days ("Ganirelix acetate injection," 2009). A study administering ganirelix to healthy adult females (n=15) found the mean (SD) elimination half-life (t1/2) to be 16.2(1.6) hours, volume of distribution/absolute bioavailability (Vd/F) 76.5(10.3) liters, maximum serum concentration (Cmax) 11.2(2.4) ng/mL, and the time until maximum concentration (tmax) 1.1(0.2) hours. One 250&amp;nbsp;µg injection of ganirelix resulted in a mean absolute bioavailability of 91.1%.&lt;ref name=Label /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Ganirelix is derived from GnRH, with amino acid substitutions made at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10.&lt;ref name=Label&gt;{{cite web|last=Organon Pharmaceuticals USA|title=Ganirelix Acetate Injection|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=12855|publisher=Archived Drug Label|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The European Commission gave marketing authorization for ganirelix throughout the European Union to N.V. Organon in May 2000.&lt;ref name=ema /&gt;

The program was announced by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEjj_XD4L21sQLY3DEogHXxLXQHAD9ICPTGG0|title=UN promotes health campaign for women, children|last=Snow|first=Anita|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The objective of the program was to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11392954|title=UN launches $40bn woman and child health plan|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4, 5 and 6 were showing the slowest rate of progression, this program was also instituted to gain momentum in achieving them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/node/8936/pdf/ewec_progress_report_final_3.pdf|title=Saving Lives Protecting Futures: Progress Report on the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health 2010-2015|work=Resource Centre|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the program was led by the [[World Health Organization]], reporting to the UN.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-governments-pledge|title=Millennium development goals: governments pledge £25.5bn to eradicate world poverty|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|author2=Curtis, Polly|date=22 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68L1K820100922|title=U.N. chief to launch women, children health drive|last=Worsnip|first=Patrick|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International aid group [[Oxfam]] expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

== Progress: 2010-2015 ==
The Global Strategy managed to improve the coordination of global efforts towards the improvement of women’s and children’s health as well as enhancing strategies to tackle this. It gave rise to the “Every Woman Every Child” movement, which assisted in the mobilisation of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite not reaching targets, reductions in both child and [[Maternal Mortality|maternal mortality]] were noted; of 49% and 45% respectively from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Temmerman|first=Marleen|last2=Khosla|first2=Rajat|last3=Bhutta|first3=Zulfiqar A.|last4=Bustreo|first4=Flavia|date=2015-09-14|title=Towards a new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4414|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4414|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4414|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26371228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.4 million maternal and child deaths were prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, [[oral rehydration therapy]] and exclusive breastfeeding coverage showed the most significant improvement, however, progress in [[vaccination]] and [[pneumonia]] was still lagging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also reported increased collaboration with the private sector, with an increase in donor funding of US$19.8 billion noted from September 2010 to May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-2015 ==
The Global Health Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents 2016-2030 was launched in September 2015, building on experience gained from 2010-2015, with the inclusion of adolescents as an additional target group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is aligned with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and has 3 main objectives; namely for women, adolescents and children to "survive", "thrive" and "transform".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuruvilla|first=Shyama|last2=Bustreo|first2=Flavia|last3=Kuo|first3=Taona|last4=Mishra|first4=CK|last5=Taylor|first5=Katie|last6=Fogstad|first6=Helga|last7=Gupta|first7=Geeta Rao|last8=Gilmore|first8=Kate|last9=Temmerman|first9=Marleen|date=2016-05-01|title=TheGlobal strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016–2030): a roadmap based on evidence and country experience|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=94|issue=5|pages=398–400|doi=10.2471/blt.16.170431|issn=0042-9686|pmc=4850541|pmid=27147772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evidence-based, multi-sectoral approach and emphasises the need to address equity, with interventions applied across the life-course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/ewec-globalstrategyreport-200915.pdf|title=The Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1382">A '''horse pond''' is a body of water used, and generally created, for the [[Horse welfare|welfare of horses]].  Horses could drink and also have their legs washed in these ponds.  They are less common in the age of powered transport.

[[File:Horse Pond - geograph.org.uk - 523029.jpg|thumb|A horse pond by the footpath from [[West Wittering]] to [[Itchenor]] ]]

==Construction==
When a horse pond was constructed in well-drained soil, and not supplied by a brook, it was lined with puddling, about 6-7 inches thick, constructed of clay and lime, rammed or trampled home. The lime was to prevent worms burrowing through the clay and making it porous. Over the puddling a causeway of tone and sand is laid, to protect the puddling form the horses' hooves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Horse ponds, especially by roads, were often designed so that the horses, and their vehicle, could be driven in one end and out the other.  Typically the water would rise no higher than the horses' knees.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Stephens|title=The Book of the Farm: Detailing the Labours of the Farmer, Farm-steward, Ploughman, Shepherd, Hedger, Cattle-man, Field-worker, and Dairy-maid|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johannes ja Emilie Barbarus 1931.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vares and his wife Emilie, 1931]]
'''Johannes Vares''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|12 January|1890|31 December 1889}} – 29 November 1946), commonly known as '''Johannes Vares Barbarus''', was an [[Estonia]]n poet, medical doctor, and politician.

Vares was born in [[Kiisa, Viljandi County|Kiisa]] Heimtali Parish (now in [[Pärsti Parish]]), [[Viljandi County]], and educated at [[Pärnu]] Gymnasium. He later studied medicine at the [[University of Kiev]], in present-day [[Ukraine]].

Vares served as a military physician in [[World War I]], and after that as a military physician for the Estonian army during the [[Estonian Liberation War]] (1918–1920), he was awarded [[Cross of Liberty (Estonia)]] for the participation, but Vares denied the offer.

Vares later worked as a doctor in [[Pärnu]], and became a well known Estonian poet as well as radical socialist, using the pen name Johannes Barbarus.

When [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied]] Estonia in June 1940, [[Andrei Zhdanov]] forced President [[Konstantin Päts]] to appoint Vares as prime minister of a Communist-dominated puppet government.  Päts resigned in July, and Vares took over most presidential duties until August 1940, when Estonia was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]]. He became a Central Committee member of the restructured [[Communist Party of Estonia|Estonian Communist (Bolshevik) Party]] on 12 September 1940, and remained nominal head of state as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Estonia.

Following the German invasion of Estonia in 1941, Vares fled to [[Russia]], where he lived in exile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettibone|first=Charles D.|title=THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF BATTLE OF MILITARIES IN WORLD WAR II|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kwTQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|volume=VOLUME IX - THE OVERRUN &amp; NEUTRAL NATIONS OF EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICAN ALLIES|year=2014|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=1490733876|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1941 to 1944, until the Soviets reconquered Estonia.

On 20 April 1944, the Electoral Committee of the Republic of Estonia (the institution specified in the Constitution for electing the Acting President of the Republic) held a clandestine meeting in Tallinn. The participants included [[Jüri Uluots]], the last Prime Minister of Estonia before the Soviet occupation, the substitute for Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces [[Johan Holberg]], the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies [[Otto Pukk]], the Second deputy Vice-Chairman of the National Council [[Alfred Maurer]], and State judge [[Mihkel Klaassen]]. The Committee declared that the Soviet-era appointment of Vares as Prime Minister had been illegal and that Uluots had assumed the President's duties from 21 June 1940 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;L. Mälksoo, ''Professor Uluots, the Estonian Government in Exile and the Continuity of the Republic of Estonia in International Law'', Nordic Journal of International Law, Volume 69, Number 3 / March, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Estonia, Vares came under investigation by the Soviet [[NKVD]] for his activities in the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. He committed suicide in [[Kadriorg Palace]] in [[Tallinn]], in November, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/67-2-1.shtml |title=Estonian Party Journal Reverts to "Un-Marxist" Terminology on Stalin's "Personality Cult" |last=Duevel |first=Christian |publisher=Open Society Archives |date=28 June 1971 |accessdate=19 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kiyoshi Tanimoto'''|谷本 清|Tanimoto Kiyoshi|1909 &amp;ndash; September 28, 1986}} was a [[Methodist]] minister famous for his work for the [[Hiroshima Maidens]].  He was one of the six Hiroshima survivors whose experiences of the bomb and later life are portrayed in [[John Hersey]]'s book ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]''.&lt;ref name=hersey&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Hersey]] |title=[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]] |year=1946}} The 1985 edition contains an updated chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tanimoto converted to Christianity in his youth, opposed by his Buddhist father. He studied at the [[Candler School of Theology]] in Atlanta, Georgia, on an international Methodist scholarship. Ordained a minister at [[Emory University]] in 1940, he served in churches in California, Okinawa and then Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Rodney ''The Hiroshima Maidens'' 1986 pp. 7&amp;ndash;8  {{ISBN|0140083529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he went on extensive speaking tours of the US, raising funds for his project of a Hiroshima peace center, and for the [[Hiroshima Maidens]].&lt;ref name=hersey/&gt; He appeared on the popular [[television]] program ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', where he and his family were placed in the uncomfortable position of meeting with Captain [[Robert A. Lewis]], copilot of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', which dropped the first atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xl3jx5_this-is-your-life-1955_shortfilms |title=Rev. Kiyoshi Tanimoto |date=May 11, 1955 |publisher=This Is Your Life |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these public activities he developed an unwanted reputation as a publicity seeker and attracted the attention of the US and Japanese authorities as a potential "anti-nuke trouble-maker".&lt;ref name=hersey/&gt; In 1972, he was interviewed by [[Thames Television]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80002843&lt;/ref&gt; for the 24th episode of the acclaimed British documentary television series, ''[[The World at War]].''

The annual [[Kiyoshi Tanimoto Peace Prize]] is named after him.

'''Medically Indigent Adults''' ('''MIAs''') in the [[health care system]] of the [[United States]] are persons who do not have [[health insurance]] and who are not eligible for other [[health care]] such as [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], or  private health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christmas|first=Robert H.|date=1985-06-10|title=Medically Indigent Adults|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1300%2FJ026v02n04_02|journal=Health Marketing Quarterly|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=7–9|doi=10.1300/j026v02n04_02|issn=0735-9683}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a term that is used both medically and for the general public. According to data reported by The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in 2017, 45% of non-elderly adults do not have medical insurance because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/|title=Key Facts about the Uninsured Population|date=2017-09-19|work=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are "medically indigent earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to purchase either health insurance or health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/eligibility/index.html|title=Eligibility|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicaid.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medially indigent people with significant illnesses face several barriers to health insurance. States like [[South Carolina]] came up with their own MIAP program to assist those who fall in the gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scdhhs.gov/internet/pdf/manuals/MIAP/Entire%20MIAP%20Manual.pdf|title=MEDICALLY INDIGENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (MIAP) MANUAL|last=|first=|date=|website=South Carolina Healthy Connections|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} Retrieved, 2018, 08,13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Help==
On March 23, 2010 the [[Affordable Care Act]] came into effect, which impacted the definition of medical indigence in the United States. The act is credited as benefiting thousands of Americans while also being detrimental to others. The initial intent for the act was to insure every person living in the United States, however in a 2015 article [[FiveThirtyEight]] stated that the act did not fix the entire problem as it did not cover [[Undocumented immigrant|undocumented]] and [[illegal aliens]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Acts such as  [[EMTALA]] ensures that every person coming into the emergency room must be treated regardless of insurance, with the patient left with the responsibility of paying the bill. The gap of not qualifying for insurance, as well as not being able to apply for insurance, leave these people in medical indigence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/33-million-americans-still-dont-have-health-insurance/|title=33 Million Americans Still Don’t Have Health Insurance|last=Barry-Jester|first=Anna Maria|date=2015-09-28|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living Outside the qualified lines==
Many states do not allow people access to Medicaid,{{Clarify|reason=This is a very vague statement - clarification is needed|date=August 2018}} even in cases of extreme poverty, if no minor children are present in the home and they have not proven they are disabled. These people have no recourse to government provided healthcare and must rely on private charitable health programs, if any exist, in their area.&lt;ref&gt;Gebeloff, Robert and Tavernise, Sabrina https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/health/millions-of-poor-are-left-uncovered-by-health-law.html Retrieved, 2018-08-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==No Discrimination==
The term also applies to those incapable, mentally or physically, to perform certain acts in consideration with the position of financial level.  Lack of capacity: financial, physical, as well as mental can be considered with verification, Medically Indigent. In the United States this term is applied regardless of race, religion, creed, or ethnicity, an actual state of being, very close to a disability, yet on the border of seemingly or likely to be non-functional at the time of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Journal Of the United States Government, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/18/2016-11458/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities|title=Nondiscrimination Retrieved, 2018-08-13 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Receiving the Help Needed==
Government MIA programs at the [[U.S. state|state]] or [[County (United States)|county]] or [[municipal]] level may help MIAs access medical care by paying for all or part of the cost of their medical care. Such programs are typically of last resort, and are available only to those who meet the "last resort" socioeconomic eligibility standards. Many people can't afford the outrageous medical bills and fall into the MIA criteria.

'''Morgan's Wonderland''' is a 25-acre non-profit [[theme park]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas for guests of all ages and abilities.  The ultra-accessible park, which opened in spring 2010 on the site of the former Longhorn Quarry, was developed by Gordon Hartman, a former homebuilder from San Antonio; his daughter, Morgan, now 24, who deals with cognitive and physical challenges, inspired creation of the park.  

Morgan's Wonderland is the first theme park of its kind in the world,  and has welcomed more than a million guests from all 50 states and 71 other countries.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170804/&gt;  Completely wheelchair-accessible, the $34 million park features more than 25 elements and attractions including rides, playgrounds, gardens, an eight-acre catch-and-release fishing lake, 18,000-square-foot special-event center, 575-seat amphitheater, picnic area and rest areas throughout the park.

The organization's mission statement is: “To provide a safe, clean and beautiful environment free of physical and economic barriers that all individuals – regardless of age, special need or disability – can come to and enjoy,” and is often accompanied by the motto, “Where Everyone Can Play!” 

Admission for guests with special needs is free; and admission fees for accompanying family members, friends, caregivers and the general public are nominal.

==History==

In 2005, Hartman sold his successful homebuilding business to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation so he and his wife, Maggie, could pursue their dream of helping children and adults with special needs.

During a family vacation, Morgan wanted to play with kids tossing a ball in a hotel swimming pool, but when she approached them, they abruptly took their ball and vanished.  “I’ll never forget the look of anguish and dismay on Morgan’s face, so I decided there had to be a way to bridge the gap of misunderstanding about people with special needs.  That incident was the tipping point for Morgan’s Wonderland and ultimately Morgan’s Inspiration Island,” Hartman said. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=www.ted.com |title=You Only Are Disabled in an Environment that Makes You That Way |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDl-fmoBJs&amp;t=259s |website=yout |publisher=TEDx Talks |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 3, 2010, Morgan's Wonderland opened, followed by a grand opening celebration on April 10, 2010, with NBA legend David Robinson and actress Eva Longoria as special guests.

On June 17, 2017, Morgan's Wonderland unveiled a major addition -- Morgan's Inspiration Island splash park. 

Because of the emphases on inclusion, the two parks have earned national and international acclaim. In 2017, the World Waterpark Association bestowed its Leading Edge Award on Morgan's Inspiration Island for ultra-accessible design and revolutionary waterproof wheelchairs. Morgan's Wonderland was proclaimed "Park of the Year" at the 2017 Golden Ticket Awards presented by Amusement Today, a publication covering the international theme parks and amusements industry. Both parks received the 2018 Barrier-Free America Award from the Paralyzed Veterans of America organization headquartered in Washington, D. C. In August 2018, Morgan's Inspiration Island was named one of "The World's Greatest Places" courtesy of TIME Magazine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World's 100 Greatest Places |url=http://time.com/collection/worlds-greatest-places-2018/ |website=time.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==

[[File:Off Road Adventure.jpg|thumb|The Off Road Adventure Ride]]
Rides custom-designed to accommodate wheelchair riders means that every family member can enjoy the fun.  Adapted rides include the Wonderland Express train, with a half-mile of track that wraps around the park's scenic lake; the Off-Road Adventure, where guests can test their driving skills in sporty all-terrain-type vehicles; the Whirling Wonder™ Ferris wheel, with a dozen brightly colored gondolas that rise up to 5 ½ stories high for panoramic views of the park; and a carousel, offering all kinds of horses and other animals ready to be ridden.  The latter sits flush with the ground and has “chariots” that move up and down as the carousel turns, giving those in wheelchairs the same sensation as guests riding horses.

At The Wharf that juts out into the lake, guests can captain their own remote-controlled pirate ships or enjoy catch-and-release fishing for catfish or bass.  There's also the Sensory Village™, a cluster of storefronts with activities to encourage imaginative play and stimulate all the senses.

After playing in either of two expansive, shaded playgrounds or on a large variety of swings (including wheelchair swings), guests can enjoy a family picnic at the covered Picnic Place.  Families have the option of purchasing snacks and drinks at Morgan's Wonderland or bringing food with them to the park.

==Entertainment==

[[File:April 2018 Shakespeare in Wonderland - "As You Like It".jpg|thumb|right|April 2018 Shakespeare in Wonderland - "As You Like It"]]
Everyone can play at Morgan's Wonderland, and everyone can enjoy the park's live entertainment, which demonstrates and celebrates inclusion. On select days of operation guests can expect meet-and-greets with park mascots and characters, live-action stage performances, interactive performances, street performers, and more. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah |title=Morgan's Wonderland Boosts its Entertainment Offerings |url=https://www.expressnews.com/entertainment/music-stage/article/Morgan-s-Wonderland-boosts-its-entertainment-7086798.php?t=50b2db3ea58cc8482c&amp;cmpid=email-premium#photo-9705175 |accessdate=24 July 2018 |agency=San Antonio Express News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the fall of 2015, Morgan's Wonderland added The Wonder Squad to their in-park entertainment lineup. Composed of four super-heroes - – accompanied by “super-eye dog,” Uno – The Wonder Squad is known for “turning disabilities into SUPER abilities.” 
* Inspired by the real-life Morgan Hartman, Morgan is the heart of the Wonder Squad. Her cognitive delay is matched by her powers of love and healing. And her emotional gifts let her soar with wings like a butterfly.
* Rocket has always believed that "just because you can't walk, doesn't mean you can't go wherever you want to go." A mechanical genius, Rocket built his own super-powered wheelchair to get around. He's the fastest on the scene, and his wit's is as quick as his wheels.
* X-Ray has been blind since birth, but that doesn't stop him from seeing the good in everyone. With the help of his super X-ray goggles and his "super-eye dog," Uno, he's ready to charge into action and save the day.
* Even with cerebral palsy, Jette has no trouble moving in style (thanks to a fashionable set of jet-powered crutches designed by Rocket). She's the brains of The Wonder Squad, and always tells people to think before they act, because "Every power needs a plan."

==GPS adventure band==

Early in the design of Morgan's Wonderland, the public was asked to identify the most important thing the park should focus on.  The number one response was safety.  Safety was taken into consideration not only in designing the custom rides and playgrounds, but also in ensuring everyone (including special-needs guests and caregivers) stays within the park boundaries.  

Thus, Morgan's Wonderland uses RFID (radio frequency identification) technology within each of its GPS Adventure Bands and its Location Stations.  Each arriving guest is offered the option to wear a GPS Adventure Band; each band has a unique identification number that's electronically assigned to the guest and his or her group.  Scanning the band at either of the two Location Stations in the park displays the exact real-time location of each group member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaw Brown |first1=Genevieve |title=World's 1st fully accessible water park opens in Texas |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/worlds-1st-fully-accessible-water-park-opens-texas/story?id=48067736 |accessdate=16 June 2017 |agency=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band also enables guests to take part in electronic activities.  For example, scanning the band at the Auto Shop in the Sensory Village will enable a guest to use a finger to “paint” an onscreen vehicle and forward the finished graphic to an email address.  Similarly, scanning the band at the Off-Road Adventure will result in the taking and sending of a photo of riders in a vehicle to the guest's email

==Sponsorships==

[[File:Toyota Plaza at Morgan's Wonderland.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Plaza in Morgan's Wonderland]]
On Aug. 28, 2012, [[Toyota]] was named presenting sponsor of Morgan's Wonderland.  Toyota shares a keen interest with Morgan's Wonderland in helping people with special needs.  Various vehicles adapted by Toyota to help physically challenged individuals can be seen on display in the park.

==Educational programs==
Each spring and fall, Morgan's Wonderland hosts more than 8,000 elementary school children from over 130 schools for structured educational field trips that are tailored specifically to state-mandated TEKS requirements.

The park also works closely with Cub Scouts in helping them complete requirements and electives, and it serves as a Girl Scouts Community Partner. All scouts who visit the park with their groups receive complimentary Morgan's Wonderland patches.

In 2017, Morgan's Wonderland began The Wonderland Inclusion Tour, a road show that allows the park to spread its mission of inclusion and understanding into the community. Shows include dance parties, interactive puppetry, and anti-bullying presentations. 

==Wonderland, Texas==
Morgan's Wonderland is the anchor of a destination called Wonderland, Texas, which exists primarily for fun as well as helping the special-needs community.  Other elements include The Academy at Morgan's Wonderland, a school for students with special needs; the Children's Rehabilitation Institute of Teletón USA (CRIT USA), a therapeutic center for youngsters with physical challenges; and Morgan's Inspiration Island. Wonderland, Texas is also the home of STRAPS (South Texas Regional Adaptive and Para Sports), which provides sports competition for athletes with disabilities and special needs. 

===The Academy at Morgan’s Wonderland===

In spring 2011, a group of families and friends met with the Hartmans to share dreams for their children with special needs.  The group's goal was to create a school in which every student from age 12 to 24 could reach his or her maximum potential.  The Academy at Morgan's Wonderland, which opened in August 2011, is the realization of that goal.  In addition to academic instruction, The Academy through its Bridge Program focuses on equipping students with life skills that will help them become productive adults.  Students directly benefit from their close proximity to Morgan's Wonderland; they get to take part in physical education sessions at the theme park.

===Children’s Rehabilitation Institute of Teletón USA (CRIT USA)===

New to Wonderland, Texas is the Children's Rehabilitation Institute of TeletónUSA, or CRIT USA, a non-profit rehabilitation center for children who are born with or who have suffered neurological, muscular or skeletal disorders and injuries.  Located next to Morgan's Wonderland, CRIT USA is the first of its kind in the United States.  It opened in November 2014 and now serves hundreds of outpatients from coast to coast.  

Morgan's Wonderland has partnered with CRIT USA to offer additional rehabilitation opportunities for patients and a recreational outlet for families whose children are undergoing treatment.  Typical physical therapy sessions make use of outdoor playground equipment and other attractions at Morgan's Wonderland.

===STRAPS (South Texas Regional Adaptive and Para Sports)===

Thanks to generous donors, STRAPS offers athletes of all ages with physical disabilities the opportunity for sports competition in eight programs such as wheelchair soccer, wheelchair basketball and goalball (a sport similar to soccer for visually impaired athletes).  Veterans wounded in the line of duty who are undergoing treatment at the San Antonio Military Medical Center and the Center for the Intrepid at nearby Fort Sam Houston represent some of the many STRAPS athletes who compete at Morgan's Wonderland on a regular basis.

==Morgan's Inspiration Island== 
[[File:Shipwreck Island Summer 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Shipwreck Island]]
[[File:Will's Hang 10 Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Will's Hang 10 Harbor]] 
On June 17, 2017, Morgan's Wonderland opened the world's first ultra-accessible splash park – Morgan's Inspiration Island.  The more than 3-acre attraction enables family members, regardless of age or ability, to cool off and beat the summer heat by splashing and playing together.

Morgan's Inspiration Island features five tropically themed splash pads.  In addition to a fun-filled collection of colorful sea creatures, Rainbow Reef provides heated water for individuals who do not enjoy or who cannot physically tolerate non-heated water.  Calypso Cove offers a musical rain garden, while Will's Hang-Ten Harbor has a large, continuous water wave as part of its surfer motif.  Shipwreck Island resembles a pirate's paradise, and Harvey's Hideaway Bay is the site of a giant jungle tree house.  Morgan's Inspiration Island also features an accessible River Boat Adventure ride. 

In keeping with the Morgan's Wonderland mission of inclusion and the desire to enable everyone to play, wheelchair guests that may have previously been unable to enjoy a splash park have the opportunity to privately transfer out of their chairs into unique, waterproof chairs.  This gives them the opportunity to enjoy the splash park with their family and friends and not risk damage to their personal wheelchairs.

[[File:Guest of Morgan's Inspiration Island in Tilt &amp; Space Chair.jpg|thumb|Guest Using Tilt and Space Chair ]]

==Wheelchair Valet== 
Equipped with three types of waterproof wheelchairs that fit a variety of heights and sizes, Wheelchair Valet is home to seven ultra-accessible changing rooms, Hoyer lifts, and adult- sized changing tables for guest use. 
In keeping with the Morgan's Wonderland mission of inclusion and the desire to enable everyone to play, wheelchair users have the opportunity to transfer into waterproof wheelchairs provided by the park, free of charge. The park also provides complimentary waterproof bags for ventilators and O2 water-collar covers for guests who need to cover tracheas. 

Morgan's Inspiration Island offers tilt and space chairs, manual / rigid chairs, and pneumatic wheelchairs (PneuChair™) – all in multiple sizes, on a first-come, first-served basis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenburg |first1=Tina |title=A Place to Play, on Wheels or Feet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/opinion/morgans-wonderland-waterpark-kids-play.html |website=https://www.nytimes.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debuted at Morgan's Wonderland on April 7, 2017, The PneuChair™ is a waterproof motorized wheelchair that runs entirely on compressed air.  It was developed by the University of Pittsburgh Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL). The PneuChair™ allows independent play for guests as an alternative to their electric wheelchair. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PneuChair Unveiled at Water Park |url=http://www.herl.pitt.edu/news-events/pneuchair-unveiled-water-park |website=http://www.herl.pitt.edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association of Social Workers''' ('''NASW''') is a professional organization of [[social work]]ers in the United States. NASW has about 132,000 members.&lt;ref name="About NASW"&gt;{{cite web|title =About NASW |publisher =National Association of Social Workers (NASW) |url =http://www.naswdc.org/nasw/default.asp |accessdate =2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NASW provides guidance, research, up to date information, advocacy, and other resources for its members and for social workers in general. Members of the NASW are also able to obtain [[malpractice insurance]], members-only publications, discounts on other products and services, and [[continuing education]].

== History ==
The National Association of Social Workers was established in 1955 through the consolidation of the following seven organizations:&lt;ref name="History of NASW"&gt;{{cite web |title =The History of NASW |publisher =National Association of Social Workers (NASW) |url =http://www.naswdc.org/nasw/history.asp |accessdate =2009-03-04 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081128120131/https://www.naswdc.org/nasw/history.asp |archivedate =2008-11-28 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* American Association of Social Workers
* American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers
* American Association of Group Workers
* Association for the Study of Community Organization
* American Association of Medical Social Workers
* National Association of School Social Workers
* Social Work Research Group

NASW’s primary functions include promoting the professional development of its members, establishing and maintaining professional standards of practice, advancing sound social policies, and providing services that protect its members and enhance their professional status. The Association developed and adopted the NASW Code of Ethics and other generalized and specialized practice standards. Certification and quality assurance are promoted through the Academy of Certified Social Workers, the NASW Register of Clinical Social Workers, and the Diplomate in Clinical Social Work. Among NASW’s political action programs are Political Action for Candidate Election and Educational Legislative Action Network. The Association also sponsors, through its 56 chapters in the U.S. and abroad, professional conferences and continuing education programs, and produces journals (such as the flagship ''Social Work''), books, and major reference works for the profession.

== Chapters ==
NASW has 56 chapters, which serve their members through the creation of units, branches, regions, or divisions. It has one chapter in each of the 50 states, with additional chapters in [[New York City]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and [[Guam]], plus an international chapter.&lt;ref name="NASW Chapters"&gt;{{cite web|title =NASW Chapters |publisher =National Association of Social Workers (NASW) |url =http://www.naswdc.org/chapters/default.asp |accessdate =2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of Ethics ==
The 1996 NASW Delegate Assembly (revised by the 1999 NASW Delegate Assembly) approved the NASW Code of Ethics (available in English and Spanish), which is intended to serve as a guide to the everyday professional conduct of social workers. This Code includes four sections. The first Section, "Preamble," summarizes the social work profession's mission and core values. The second section, "Purpose of the NASW Code of Ethics," provides an overview of the Code's main functions and a brief guide for dealing with ethical issues or dilemmas in social work practice. The third section, "Ethical Principles," presents broad ethical principles, based on social work's core values, that inform social work practice. The final section, "Ethical Standards," includes specific ethical standards to guide social workers' conduct and to provide a basis for adjudication.&lt;ref name="NASW Code of Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title =Code of Ethics |publisher =National Association of Social Workers (NASW) |url =http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/default.asp |accessdate =2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, the Code of Ethics includes an LGBT non-discrimination policy.&lt;ref name="policiesdiscriminatorylennondearing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delavega|first1=Elena|last2=Lennon-Dearing|first2=Robin|title=Policies Discriminatory of the LGBT Community: Do Social Workers Endorse Respect for the NASW Code of Ethics?|journal=[[Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services]]|date=2015|volume=27|issue=4|pages=412–435|doi=10.1080/10538720.2015.1087266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Association of Social Workers Foundation ==
The National Association of Social Workers Foundation (NASWF) is a charitable organization created to enhance the well-being of individuals, families, and communities through the advancement of social work practice. It was founded in 2001 and its goals are to:

* Identify, develop and respond to social work policy and practice issues.
* Assist with rapid response to social crises.
* Support practice-based research, so that practice and research are directly linked.
* Raise the visibility of social work and enhance public esteem for the profession.
* Support the development of cutting edge continuing education that addresses critical issues.
* Promote the appropriate application of new technology to the practice of social work.

NASWF is managed by a nine-member Board of Directors that comprises the current NASW President, three NASW members, and three individuals involved in professions other than social work. Nonvoting members of the board include the NASW Executive Director who serves as President of the Foundation and the NASW President-Elect.

The Foundation administers a wide variety of educational and research programs in an effort to fulfill its core mission of enhancing the well-being of individuals, families, and communities through the advancement of social work policy and practice. Foundation assets total more than $3.1 million, including the NASWF Endowment, which is funded by voluntary contributions from NASW members and other supporters.

== National Professional Social Work Month ==
NASW introduced National Professional Social Work Month for the first time in March 1963. The original purpose was to encourage public support and interest in social work as a profession. NASW was able to create a buzz around Social Work Month by engaging the public through various television ad campaigns that aired throughout the sixties. This tactic was successful in the early years, generating more than 35,000 letters of support from the public and attracting media coverage of notable social workers in local newspapers.

It wasn't until 1984 that the White House officially recognized March as National Professional Social Work Month. A joint resolution was introduced by Sen Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y) declaring March 1984 as National Social Work Month. This was followed by a lobbying push from NASW chapters and the cosponsorship of Sen. Strom Thurmond (R. S.C). The resolution was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.

== NASW Press ==
NASW Press is the division of the National Association of Social Workers that [[academic publishing|publishes]] books and journals for the social work profession. The NASW Press was formally established in 1990 to advance social work scholarship through the publication of books, journals, and other resources.&lt;ref name=Beebe&gt;Beebe, L. (1993). Preface. In L. Beebe (Ed.), Professional Writing for the Human Services (pp. vi–x). Washington, DC: NASW Press&lt;/ref&gt; The NASW Press portfolio includes a monthly newspaper, [[academic journals]], scholarly texts, practice manuals, reference works, pamphlets, brochures, and videos.

The National Association of Social Workers began publishing its flagship journal, ''Social Work'', a small number of books, and a yearbook under the direction of Beatrice Saunders in 1955.&lt;ref name=Beebe/&gt; In 2010, NASW Press published over 100 scholarly textbooks, peer-reviewed journals, practice manuals, reference works, pamphlets, videos, and brochures in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name=NASW2009&gt;National Association of Social Workers. (2009). NASW Annual Report 2009–2010. Available at http://www.naswdc.org/nasw/annual_report/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
;''NASW News'': ''NASW News'' began publishing in 1956 and is the official newspaper of the National Association of Social Workers. The ''News'', published 10 times a year (monthly, with the exception of August and December), is an information vehicle for practitioners, administrators, researchers, faculty, and students, and members of the association.

;Journals: Since NASW began publishing its flagship journal, ''Social Work'', in 1955, its portfolio has grown to five journals—including the specialty journals ''Children &amp; Schools'', ''Health &amp; Social Work'', and ''Social Work Research''—and ''Social Work Abstracts''.

:''Social Work Abstracts'' is a resource for literature searches in social work and social welfare. The president of NASW appoints members to the journal’s advisory group, which establishes policy for the journal.&lt;ref name=Beebe/&gt;

;Reference Works: Among NASW Press' reference works, the ''Encyclopedia of Social Work'' and ''The Social Work Dictionary'' are the most widely distributed titles. In 2010, the encyclopedia and dictionary are respectively in their 20th and 5th editions. NASW policy statements are revised and published every three years in ''Social Work Speaks'', which is now in its 8th edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naswpress.org/publications/reference/index.html NASW Press. (2010). “Reference Works”.]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Books: In 2010, NASW Press has 75 books in circulation, including scholarly books and practice manuals. Between 2009 and 2010, NASW Press released 14 new titles, including several revised and updated academic textbooks. Along with these titles, NASW practice standards in pamphlet form, brochures for education and training, videos, DVDs, and posters comprise the NASW Press portfolio totaling over 110 publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naswpress.org/publications/index.html NASW Press.

{{Nihongo|'''National Health Insurance'''|国民健康保険|Kokumin-Kenkō-Hoken|}} is one of the two major types of insurance programs available in Japan. The other is 
{{Nihongo|Employees' Health Insurance|健康保険|Kenkō-Hoken|}}. National Health insurance is designed for people who are not eligible to be members of any employment-based health insurance program. Although private insurance is also available, all Japanese citizens, permanent residents, and any non-Japanese residing in Japan with a visa lasting three months or longer are required to be enrolled in either National Health Insurance or Employees' Health Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Shibuya City Office National Health Insurance (NHI)[https://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp/eng/living/health.html] Retrieved on April 6, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;
On July 9, 2012, the alien registration system was abolished and foreigners are now able to apply as part of the Basic Resident Registration System. Foreigners who reside in Japan for more than three months need to register for national health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Mitaka City Municipal Office Information National Health Insurance (Kokumin Kenko Hoken)[http://www.city.mitaka.tokyo.jp/foreign/english/003/006.html] Retrieved on April 6, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.city.ota.gunma.jp/005gyosei/0020-007kikaku-kouryu/kokusaikouryu-eng/files/16KokuminKenkouHokenEn.pdf REGISTRO CIVIL - 16KokuminKenkouHokenEn.pdf]
It is defined by the [[National Health Care Act of 1958]].&lt;ref&gt; e-Gov.go.jp [http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/S33/S33HO192.html 国民健康保険法] Retrieved on September 1, 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Japan’s first health insurance system was introduced in 1922. It took effect in 1927 to cover laborers, and in 1938 was extended to cover farmers also.&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100525i1.html National health insurance a basic universal safety net] Retrieved January 3rd 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The system originated from [[Labor unions in Japan|labor unions]] representing workers in dangerous industries, and over time was gradually extended so that currently all Japanese citizens and residents should be covered.

The current NHI system, which is managed by local municipal governments, was introduced in 1961. The information in this article relates to [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato Ward]] in Tokyo, and NHI conditions in other municipalities may differ.

==Joining NHI==
People are required to join the NHI within two weeks of becoming eligible. This is required if a person moves to the municipality from another municipality or overseas and isn’t covered by Employees' Health Insurance, withdraws from Employees' Health Insurance (for example, due to job loss), stops receiving public assistance, or is born (and not covered under parents Employees Health Insurance).&lt;ref name="MinatoCity"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who do not register when they become eligible and register later, can be charged for up to two years of back payments.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity" /&gt;

A person applies to their local ward office or city office, which issues them with a NHI card, and invoices for the NHI premiums. The insured person then pays the premiums, and is now covered.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_a"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the National Health Insurance works==
When the insured person uses a medical facility that accepts NHI, they will only need to pay part of the cost. 

The medical facility will then send invoices for the remaining amount to the National Health Insurance Federation, which reviews and pays the medical facility. After this, the NHIF reports on the invoices to the municipal office, which reimburses the NHIF.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_a" /&gt;

==Withdrawing from NHI==
There are several different grounds for withdrawing from NHI.

* As NHI is managed by local municipalities, if an insured person moves to another municipality, they must withdraw from their current municipality’s NHI and enter the NHI of their new area.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity" /&gt;
* If the insured person is not a Japanese citizen and leaves Japan without intention of returning, or without re-entry permission they must settle their premium in advance.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_b"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;
* NHI members also withdraw if they join Employees' Health Insurance, start receiving public assistance, or pass away.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_b" /&gt;

==Other notifications==
Insured people are required to notify the city if they change their address, their name, the head of household, lose their NHI card, or the NHI members covered under the card have changed.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_b" /&gt;134

==Insurance Premiums==
{{update-section|date=April 2014}}
In 2013 the calculation method for premiums changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/naka/english/nwtn/nwtn2013/129.pdf |title=Calculation Method for National Health Insurance Premiums to Change |newspaper=Naka Ward Town News |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.mitaka.tokyo.jp/foreign/english/003/006.html |title=National Health Insurance (Kokumin Kenko Hoken) |publisher=Makita City |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of NHI premiums. The head of household is responsible for payment, even if they are not a NHI member. The rate at which the premiums are calculated is based on the 
{{Nihongo|Resident's tax|住民税|juuminzei|}} amount charged by the local municipal government. This is in turn based on income earned by that member during the previous calendar year. Resident’s tax is determined in June, and notifications are sent in July. Because of this, the yearly NHI premium is divided into 10 installments. In 2010 the premiums were:&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

* Category 1 - The basic premium (for regular NHI members.)
Calculated by multiplying the total residents tax paid by all NHI members in the household by 0.80. This is the income levy. Then multiplying the number of insured household members by 39,000. This is the per capita levy. These two levies added together are the annual premium that must be paid. The maximum possible is 580,000 per year.

* Category 2 - The premium for supporting the elderly (for people older than 75.)
Calculated by multiplying the total residents tax paid by all NHI members in the household by 0.23. This is the income levy. Then multiplying the number of insured household members by 12,000. This is the per capita levy. These two levies added together are the annual premium that must be paid. The maximum possible is 190,000 per year.

* Category 3 - For nursing care (for people in long-term care)
Calculated by multiplying the total residents tax paid by all category 2 NHI members in the household by 0.11. This is the income levy. Then multiplying the number of category 2 household members by 15,600. This is the per capita levy. These two levies added together are the annual premium that must be paid. The maximum possible is 160,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Setagaya-ku Health Insurance Notification, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection procedures==
If NHI members do not make payment, a reminder will be sent. If payment is still not received after the reminder, the members NHI card will be replaced with a short term (6 month) card. 

If payment has not been received for a year, NHI members may have to return their NHI card, and will be provided with an eligibility certificate. This shows that the person is a NHI member and can receive treatment, but must bear all the costs themselves. However, it is possible that the amount that NHI bears can be applied to the members premiums at a later date.

If payments are not made, the municipality may have the members property (savings, salaries, telephone lines, etc.) seized to pay for the arrears.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHI benefits==
===General Medical Benefits===
When the insured person uses a medical facility that accepts NHI, they will only need to pay part of the cost. As of 2011 this copayment will be either 10% or 30% depending on the income of the insured person, and in April 2011 the lowest rate will rise to 20%.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_c"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Those aged between 70 to 74 are entitled to a NHI Elderly Recipient Certificate. Those with this certificate have to make a copayment of either 10% or 30% depending on their income.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_c" /&gt;

===Exceptions===
NHI cannot be used in the following cases:
* Failure to follow doctor’s instructions regarding treatment.
* Intentionally inflicted injury or illness resulting from a crime or suicide.
* Injury or illness resulting from a fight or drunkenness.
* Treatment unrelated to illness (health examinations, preventative injections, cosmetic surgery, orthodontic work, normal child delivery/abortion for economic reasons, etc.).
* Private or semi-private room charges during your hospitalization.
* Injury during work (either covered by worker’s compensation or the employer).
* When a patient themselves desired to receive treatment without using the insurance.
* Combination of insured and uninsured treatment or totally uninsured treatment in dental treatment using special materials.

Members can apply for benefits within two years of becoming entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitalization expenses===
For those under 70 years of age:
If NHI members show their NHI card and a Maximum Ceiling Amount Applicable Certificate together the member will only have to pay the amount specified as their personally borne expense ceiling. For members who are exempt from residents tax, a Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally Borne Amount Reduction Certificate is required. These certificates must be applied for at the city office.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_d"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 30,36&lt;/ref&gt;

For those over 70 years of age:
If NHI members over 70 years old who pay Resident’s tax show their NHI card and an Old Age Medical Insurance card they only have to pay the amount specified as their personally borne expense ceiling.

Maximum Ceiling Amount Applicable Certificate together the member will only have to pay the amount specified as their personally born expense ceiling. For members who are exempt from residents tax, their NHI card, Old-Age Medical Insurance Card and a Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally Borne Amount Reduction Certificate is required. This certificate must be applied for at the city office.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_d" /&gt;

===Cash reimbursements===
NHI members can go to their city office to apply for cash reimbursements for when they pay the full amount for medical services. It takes about three months. Situations covered are:

* If a member was treated for a sudden illness without showing their NHI card and had to pay the entire cost.
* When the NHI member unavoidably received treatment at a facility that does not accept NHI. If using this facility was voluntary no reimbursement can be received.
* For the costs of medical corsets, casts, or other therapeutic devices recommended by a doctor.
* When [[acupuncture]], [[moxibustion]], or massage is received upon a doctors consent. Reimbursement does not always happen in this case.
* Transportation costs during emergencies or if the member has trouble walking when hospitalized and leaving the hospital.
* If a member receives medical treatment overseas after falling suddenly ill. This does not apply if the member travels overseas for the purpose of recuperating.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies for high medical expenses===
If the personally borne medical expenses exceed a certain amount NHI members can apply to have a certain amount reimbursed. Reimbursements are paid about four months after the medical service is provided.

NHI members under 70 years of age must show their NHI card and either their Maximum Ceiling Amount Applicable Certificate or Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally-Borne Amount Reduction Certificate to pay only their personally borne expense ceiling. Members under 70 years old are not eligible for the high-cost medical benefit.

NHI members over 70 and under 75 years of age are responsible for paying up to their expense ceiling as usual. But members from households who are except from resident’s tax will be categorized as Low Income Earner 1 or 2. 

Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally-Borne Amount Reduction Certificate is required for these members to have the amount they must pay decreased from their normal personally borne expense ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Medical Expense Subsidy Application Procedures===
An application kit should be sent three or four months after the month of the examination/treatment. The form should be completed and returned to the city office.

If the expenses were from hospitalization, members should apply for a Maximum Ceiling Amount Applicable Certificate or a Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally Borne Amount Reduction Certificate, whichever is appropriate. Members who have one of these certificates will only need to pay the maximum ceiling amount for the examination/treatment, and therefore have no need to apply for a High Medical Expense Subsidy.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_e"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loans for High Medical Expenses===
As it takes a long time for reimbursements for high medical expenses to be made, loans are available for those who have trouble paying their medical bills in the meantime.
Requirements: Those who are prospective candidates for a High Medical Expense Subsidy.
Loan amount: Within 90% of the estimated High Medical Expense Subsidy.
* There is also another method by which the NHI member pays the personally-borne expense ceiling amount to the medical institution, and the city pays the high medical expense subsidy directly to the medical institution, pending approval of the medical institution.
* For hospitalization expenses, members who apply for a Maximum Ceiling Amount Applicable Certificate or a Ceiling Applied/Standard Personally Borne Amount Reduction Certificate, whichever is appropriate and show it to the medical institution counter, members will only need to pay the maximum ceiling amount for the examination/treatment, and therefore have no need to apply for a loan.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_e" /&gt;

===Meal Expenses During Hospitalization===
During hospitalization, members must bear a portion of the meal expense.

(i) Hospitalized up to 90 days in the last 12 months

(ii) Hospitalized over 90 days in the last 12 months

(iii) Recipient of the Elderly Recipient Certificate whose household is exempt from resident's ta and the total income of the household is ¥0 (Pension income is calculated with deduction amount as ¥800,000.

===Childbirth allowance===
When a NHI member gives birth, ¥420,000 will be provided for each child. This allowance is also paid in cases of miscarriage or stillbirth if this occurs after 85 days (4 months) of pregnancy. However, this will not be provided to those who receive a childbirth allowance from other health insurance programs. The mother presents her NHI card at the hospital, and NHI will pay the hospital directly. If the cost of childbirth is more than ¥420,000 the member must pay the remainder. If the cost is less than ¥420,000, the member will receive the balance. A form will be sent approximately 2 months after delivery, which must be returned to claim the balance.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to apply for this childbirth allowance if the NHI member has their baby outside Japan, the member should speak to the local city office about the procedures for doing this.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f"&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral Allowances===
When a NHI member dies, ¥70,000 is paid for funeral services. However, if a person who was covered under Employees' Health Insurance died within 3 months of resignation, Employees' Health Insurance will pay for the funeral allowance, not NHI. Also, if the death was due to the act of a third party (such as a traffic accident) and their compensation is available, NHI will not provide the funeral allowance.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f" /&gt;

===Individual Medical Expense Reductions or Exemptions===
A portion of the cost of medical treatment must be paid by the NHI member. However, if their livelihood has been effected by a natural disaster, unemployment, or other difficulties, then reductions of or exemptions from paying their copayment are possible for a period of up to three months.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f" /&gt;

===Injuries from Traffic Accidents or Attacks===
Reports are required before receiving treatment with an NHI certificate. For injuries caused by a third party (for example a traffic accident or assault) the person who caused the injury is liable. However, it may be possible to use NHI if the person responsible does not pay and if the proper notifications are filed. The NHI will charge the responsible person afterwards. If you receive treatment using NHI, you must contact the NHI and Pension section of the city office before and submit "report of accident and sickness by the third party" later.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f" /&gt;

===Exceptions===
NHI cannot be used in the following cases
*The treatment fee was already paid by the person who caused the accident
*Work-related injuries
*Injuries due to driving while intoxicated or without a license&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f" /&gt;

==Disclosure of Medical Fee Receipts==
If it receives a request, after about one month the city will disclose medical fee receipts and other documents to:
* The person whose name is on the receipt
* Bereaved family members (parents, spouse, or children)
* Legal representatives where the person or their bereaved family members are minors or wards who are of age.
* Attorney appointed by the said person or their bereaved family members.&lt;ref name="MinatoCity_f" /&gt;

==Long Life Health Insurance system==
When NHI members reach 75 years old (or 65 for those with a certain degree of disability) they can receive medical care under the Long Life Health Insurance System. An insurance card is issued to all eligible members. Premiums are based on the member's income.&lt;ref&gt;Minato City National Health Insurance Guidebook 2010, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Number 16''' (also '''#16'''&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt;) was a wild female [[armored trapdoor spider|trapdoor spider]] (''[[Gaius villosus]],'' family [[Idiopidae]]) that lived in North Bungulla Reserve near [[Tammin, Western Australia]]. She died in 2016, at an estimated age of 43 years, and is the longest-lived [[spider]] recorded to date.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; Number 16 did not die of old age, but was most likely killed by a parasitic [[spider wasp|wasp]] sting.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/worlds-oldest-known-spider-dies-at-43-after-a-quiet-life-underground/|title=World's oldest known spider dies at 43 after a quiet life underground|first=Agence |last=France-Presse|date=30 April 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Long-term monitoring==
Number 16 was born in 1974, and was studied in the wild by arachnologist [[Barbara York Main]] from March 1974 until 2016.&lt;ref name=2018paper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=Leanda Denise|last2=Wardell-Johnson|first2=Grant|last3=Main|first3=Barbara York|title=The longest-lived spider: mygalomorphs dig deep, and persevere|journal=Pacific Conservation Biology|date=2018|doi=10.1071/PC18015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/04/27/farewell-no-16-scientists-left-miserable-worlds-oldest-spider/|title=Farewell, No. 16: scientists left 'miserable' after world's oldest spider dies aged 43|first=Henry|last=Bodkin|date=27 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/number-16-worlds-oldest-known-spider-dies-aged-43-2676125|title=Number 16, World’s Oldest Known Spider, Dies Aged 43|date=28 April 2018|website=ibtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of the first cohort of dispersing spiderlings to establish a burrow at the study site, and her burrow was the 16th to be marked with a peg.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; By 1978, Main had tagged 101 burrows at the study site, within a few metres of each other.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

Number 16 spent her entire life in the same [[burrow]], which is typical for her species.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; For over 40 years, her status was monitored by Main and her collaborators either six-monthly or annually.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; As Number 16 became older, the researchers developed a tradition of always checking her burrow first when they visited the site.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Death==
On 31 October 2016, researcher Leanda Mason discovered Number 16's burrow in disrepair, and the spider missing.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Avi Selk (2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/05/01/the-extraordinary-life-and-death-of-the-worlds-oldest-known-spider/ "The extraordinary life and death of the world’s oldest known spider"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1 May 2018. Accessed 2 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The silk plug of her burrow had been pierced by a parasitic [[spider wasp]], suggesting that she had been parasitised, either before or after death.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; During a survey six months earlier, Number 16 had been alive.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; “She was cut down in her prime [...] It took a while to sink in, to be honest," said Mason.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;  The spider's death received widespread publicity in late April 2018, with the publication of a research article in the journal ''[[Pacific Conservation Biology]]''.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt; Based on the burrow fidelity of females of her species, the researchers concluded with a "high level of certainty" that Number 16 was 43 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=2018paper/&gt;

The '''Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Program Snapshot|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/promis|work=National Institutes of Health Common fund|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''PROMIS''') provides clinicians and researchers access to reliable, valid, and flexible measures of health status that assess physical, mental, and social well–being from the patient perspective. PROMIS measures are standardized, allowing for assessment of many patient-reported outcome domains—including pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical functioning and social role participation—based on common metrics that allow for comparisons across domains, across chronic diseases, and with the general population. Further, PROMIS tools allow for computer adaptive testing, efficiently achieving precise measurement of health status domains with few items. There are PROMIS measures for both adults and children. PROMIS was established in 2004 with funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as one of the initiatives of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH PROMIS Roadmap |url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |work=NIH Commonfund |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217072814/https://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |archivedate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
The NIH established the Roadmap for Medical Research in 2004 to identify major opportunities for medical research and the development of new scientific expertise and technology that would lead to tangible benefits for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH PROMIS History|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the programs within the Roadmap, Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise, called for developing rigorous and systematic infrastructure for clinical research and for translating scientific discoveries into practical applications or tools that can be used by healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The NIH Roadmap: Re-Engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise |publisher = National Institutes of Health | url = http://or.org/pdf/NIH_Roadmap-ClinicalResearch.pdf| series=NIH Backgrounder |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROMIS is one initiative within this program.
The PROMIS initiative develops and evaluates standard measures for key patient-reported health indicators and symptoms.&lt;ref name=Progress-2007&gt;{{cite journal|first1=David |last1=Cella |first2=Susan |last2=Yount |first3=Nan |last3=Rothrock |first4=Richard |last4=Gershon |first5=Karon |last5=Cook |first6=Bryce |last6=Reeve |first7=Deborah |last7=Ader |first8=James F. |last8=Fries |first9=Bonnie |last9=Bruce |first10=Mattias |last10=Rose |author11=PROMIS Cooperative Group|title=The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS): Progress of an NIH Roadmap Cooperative Group During its First Two Years|journal=Medical Care|date=May 2007|volume=45|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S3-S11|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000258615.42478.55|pmid=17443116|pmc=2829758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient-reported measures such as pain, fatigue, emotional distress, and physical functioning complement clinical measures (e.g., x-rays and lab tests) by providing healthcare providers with information about what patients are able to do and how they feel.&lt;ref name=developing_ader&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ader|first=Deborah N.|title=Developing the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)|journal=Medical Care|date=May 2007|volume=45|issue=5 Suppl 1|pages=S1-S2|url=http://uwcorr.washington.edu/publications/developing_ader.pdf|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000260537.45076.74|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215635/http://uwcorr.washington.edu/publications/developing_ader.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PROMIS has worked to unify the field of [[patient-reported outcome]] (PRO) measurement through the promotion of a common, systematic measurement system broadly applicable across clinical research. PROMIS measures are intended to assess the most common or salient dimensions of patient–relevant outcomes for the widest possible range of chronic disorders and diseases, thus they are "generic" measures vs. specific to given disease or condition. Structured as a multi-institutional collaboration with NIH, PROMIS has advanced the consensus process within the field of PRO measurement through the involvement of the funded research collaborative in establishing a rigorous, systematic infrastructure for measure development and psychometric evaluation.&lt;ref name=developing_ader /&gt;

PROMIS takes advantage of developments in technology, as well as advances in the sciences of psychometric, qualitative, cognitive, and health survey research, to create new models and methods for collecting PROs for use in clinical research and evaluation of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS: Clinical Outcomes Assessment - Overview|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/promis/overview.aspx|work=NIH Common Fund|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROMIS incorporates and translates cutting-edge science into practical, easy to use tools for clinicians: For example, PROMIS implements [[Computerized adaptive testing|Computer Adaptive Test]] (CAT) software which tailors the PRO assessment to the individual patient by selecting the most informative set of questions based on responses to previous questions. CAT questionnaires allow an accurate measurement of health status using the fewest possible questions.

==Assessment and expansion==

In November 2012, the PROMIS network held it first international strategy meeting with organizational partners from 8 European countries, China and Canada to develop a strategic action plan for the international spread of PROMIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research/promis-international | title = Summary | date = 2 November 2016 | conference = PROMIS International Strategy Session | location = University of Pennsylvania &amp; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, PROMIS unveiled new materials to expand its outreach to researchers and clinicians: the PROMIS e-newsletter and two instructional videos series about PROMIS and Item Response Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conceptual Introduction to Item Response Theory|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/measure-development-research|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an updated PROMIS website at www.HealthMeasures.net was created to provide more information about measure selection, data collection tools, score calculation, score interpretation, item response theory, and support an online forum for posting questions to the PROMIS user community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Website|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis|accessdate= 2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliates==
The PROMIS initiative is fulfilled by a network of primary research sites and coordinating centers that collaborate to develop the items and tools to measure PROs, and to evaluate the reliability and validity of these measures.&lt;ref name=Progress-2007 /&gt;
Between 2004 and 2009, PROMIS consisted of a Statistical Coordinating Center, located at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, and six research sites located at Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Pittsburgh, Stanford University, Stony Brook University, and University of Washington. In 2010, NIH renewed funding for PROMIS and expanded the program to six additional research sites: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Boston University / University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; University of California, Los Angeles; Georgetown University; Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati; and University of Maryland, Baltimore. PROMIS also added a Network Center, operated by the American Institutes for Research, Washington DC as well as a Statistical Center and a Technology Center, both operated by Northwestern University. These centers provided logistical and technical support to PROMIS. 

In September 2014, the NIH extended its support to PROMIS through funding the National Person Centered Assessment Resource (PCAR/HealthMeasures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Person Centered Assessment Resource Grant|url=https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9136083&amp;icde=31756423&amp;ddparam=&amp;ddvalue=&amp;ddsub=&amp;cr=1&amp;csb=default&amp;cs=ASC|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other measurement systems, Quality of Life in Neurologic Disorders (Neuro-QoL), Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement system (ASCQ-Me), and the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIH Toolbox) are also supported through HealthMeasures. HealthMeasures aims to facilitate the dissemination, implementation, and self-sustainability of these four measurement systems. The HealthMeasures grant was awarded to Northwestern University with additional sites at American Institutes for Research, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Diego, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and University of Pittsburgh.

==Mission==
PROMIS uses measurement science to create a state-of-the-science assessment system for self–reported health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Mission, Vision &amp; Goals|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Create and promulgate a set of qualitative and quantitative methodological standards for development and validation of PROMIS instruments.
* Launch a sustainable entity that is able to continue and grow the research, development, and dissemination activities for the network.
* Identify and prioritize a set of research and development opportunities for PROMIS that include, but are not limited to, clinical applications.
* Disseminate information on PROMIS to forge strategic alliances with key individuals and organizations that that will help PROMIS fulfill its vision and enhance its adoption in research, clinical practice, and policy.

==Measures==
PROMIS has self-reported health measures in the domains of physical health, mental health and social health for adult self-reported and pediatric-self and proxy-reported health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROMIS Domains|url=http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/intro-to-promis|work=PROMIS website|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under each main domain (physical health, mental health, social health) are sub-domains associated with symptoms, function, affect, behavior, cognition, relationships or function. The sub-domains developed as of November 2016 are listed below. Domains that are “PROMIS Profile Domains” are included in either PROMIS Adult Profile Instruments (PROMIS-29, PROMIS-43, PROMIS-57) and Pediatric or Parent Proxy Profile Instruments (PROMIS Pediatric/Parent Proxy 25, PROMIS Pediatric/Parent Proxy 37, PROMIS Pediatric/Parent Proxy 49).

The '''Persian cat''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: گربه ایرانی ''Gorbe Irâni'') is a long-haired breed of [[cat]] characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the [[English-speaking countries]]. In the [[Middle East]] region they are widely known as "Iranian cat" and in Iran they are known as "[[Shiraz]]i cat". The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into [[Italy]] from [[Iran]] (historically known as [[Name of Iran|Persia]]) around 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persiancatcorner.com/persian-cat-information/|title=Persian Cat Information {{!}} Persian Cat Corner|last=|first=|date=|access-date=|work=Persian Cat Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact history of the Persian cat does seem to be a bit of a mystery but many of these long-haired cats were seen in hieroglyphics. The story has it that these long-haired cats were then imported into Europe as their popularity grew and breeding took place in Italy and France.

The Persian cat was first presented at the world's first organised cat show in 1871 in London, England, before making its way to the United States of America in the early 1900s. The Persian cat breeding standards have always called for a cat with a short face, but it's important to note that the Persian cat originally had a much longer nose than the flat-faced Persians of today. Hereditary [[polycystic kidney disease]] is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half the population in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icatcare.org/advice/polycystic-kidney-disease|title=Polycystic kidney disease {{!}} International Cat Care|website=icatcare.org|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/PolycysticKidneyDisease.cfm|title=Polycystic Kidney Disease|website=www.vet.cornell.edu|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 it was ranked as the 2nd most popular breed in the United States according to the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfa.org/AboutCFA/News/PressReleases/PressRelease20160201Top10Breeds.aspx|title=Press Release February 1, 2016 - Top 10 Breeds for 2015|website=cfa.org|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic]] breed.

==Origin==
It is not clear when long-haired cats first appeared, as there are no known long-haired specimens of the [[African wildcat]], the ancestor of the domestic subspecies.

[[File:Persian aka Angora from 1894.JPG|thumb|left|An Angora/Persian from ''The Royal Natural History'' (1894).]]
The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], Iran, into Italy in 1620 by [[Pietro della Valle]], and from Angora (now [[Ankara]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[Turkey]]), into France by [[Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] at around the same time. The Khorasan cats were grey coated while those from Angora were white. From France, they soon reached Britain.&lt;ref name="messybeastLHC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.messybeast.com/longhair-cats.htm | title=Longhaired Cats | publisher=Sarah Hartwell | work=Messybeast Cats | date=2013 | accessdate=July 9, 2015 | last=Hartwell | first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=July 2015|reason=This is Sarah Hartwell's personal cat blog, "not affiliated to any registry, breed society, veterinary association or welfare society", not professionally edited, and citing no sources.}}

Recent genetic research indicates that present day Persians are related not to cats from the [[Near East]] but to cats from Western Europe. The researchers stated, "Even though the early Persian cat may have in fact originated from Persia (Iran), the modern Persian cat has lost its [[Phylogeography|phylogeographical]] signature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Monika J.|last1=Lipinski |first2=Lutz|last2=Froenicke |first3=Kathleen C.|last3=Baysac |first4=Nicholas C.|last4=Billings |first5=Christian M.|last5=Leutenegger |first6=Alon M.|last6=Levy |first7=Maria|last7=Longeri |first8=Tirri|last8=Niini |first9=Haydar|last9=Ozpinar |first10=Margaret R.|last10=Slater |first11=Niels C.|last11=Pedersen |first12=Leslie A.|last12=Lyons |title=The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random Bred Populations |journal=Genomics |date=January 2008 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=12–21 |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.10.009 |pmc=2267438 |pmid=18060738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Persian cat was presented at the first organized [[cat show]], in 1871 in [[the Crystal Palace]] in London, England, organized by [[Harrison Weir]]. As specimens closer to the later established Persian conformation became the more popular types, attempts were made to differentiate it from the [[Angora cat|Angora]].&lt;ref name="Helgren"&gt;{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J. Anne. |title=Cat Breed Detail: Persian Cats |date=2006 |work=Iams.com |publisher=Telemark Productions / Procter &amp; Gamble |url=http://www.iams.com/iams/en_US/jsp/IAMS_Page.jsp?pageID=CBD&amp;breedPage=persian.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081119191145/http://www.iams.com/iams/en_US/jsp/IAMS_Page.jsp?pageID=CBD&amp;breedPage=persian.html |archivedate=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first breed standard (then called a ''points of excellence'' list) was issued in 1889 by cat show promoter Weir. He stated that the Persian differed from the Angora in the tail being longer, hair more full and coarse at the end and head larger, with less pointed ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weir|first=Harrison |title=Our Cats and All About Them |date=1889 |location=Tunbridge Wells, UK |publisher=R. Clements &amp; Co. |lccn=2002554760 |ol=3664970M |url= https://archive.org/details/ourcatsallaboutt00weir |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all cat fanciers agreed with the distinction of the two types, and in the 1903 work ''The Book of the Cat'', Francis Simpson states that "the distinctions, apparently with hardly any difference, between Angoras and Persians are of so fine a nature that I must be pardoned if I ignore the class of cat commonly called Angora".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson|first=Frances. |title=The Book of the Cat |date=1903 |page=98 |location=London/New York |publisher=Cassell and Company |lccn=03024964 |ol=7205700M |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofcatsimpson00simprich |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Bevill Champion lays out the difference between the two types in the 1909 ''Everybody's Cat Book'':&lt;ref name="champion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Champion |first=Dorothy Bevill |year=1909 |title=Everybody's Cat Book |page=17 |publisher=Lent &amp; Graff |location=New York |lccn=10002159 |oclc=8291178 |ol=7015748M |url= https://archive.org/details/everybodyscatboo00cham |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our pedigree imported long-hairs of to-day are undoubtedly a cross of the Angora and Persian ; the latter possesses a rounder head than the former, also the coat is of quite a different quality. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bell goes on to detail the differences. Persian coats consists of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat.The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body." The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora "fails to the Persian in head," Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a more appealing round head.

Bell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.

Champion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella term "Long-haired Cats".&lt;ref name="champion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helgren2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

===Traditional Persian===
[[File:SnowyandHazy.jpg|thumb|Traditional Persian.]]
{{Main|Traditional Persian cat}}
The '''traditional Persian''', or '''doll-face Persian''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buyfuffy.com|title=Cats and Kittens: Maine coon Kittens|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are somewhat recent names for what is essentially the original breed of Persian cat, without the development of extreme features.

As many breeders in the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and other parts of the world started to interpret the Persian standard differently, they developed the flat-nosed "peke-face" or "ultra" type {{crossref|selfref=no|(see next section)}} over time, as the result of two genetic mutations, without changing the name of the breed from "Persian".  Some organizations, including the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), today consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed. Thus the [[retronym]] Traditional Persian was created to refer to the original type, which is still bred today, mirroring the renaming of the original-style [[Siamese cat]] as the Traditional Siamese, to distinguish it from long-faced modern development which has taken over as simply "the Siamese".

Not all cat fancier groups recognize the Traditional Persian (at all, or as distinct), or give it that specific name. [[The International Cat Association|TICA]] has a very general standard, that does not specify a flattened face.&lt;ref name="TICA std"&gt;{{cite web |title=Persian Breed Group |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=TICA.org |date=May 1, 2004 |location=Harlingen, Texas |publisher=[[The International Cat Association]] |url= http://www.tica.org/members/publications/standards/ps.pdf |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peke-face and ultra-typing===
In the late 1950s a spontaneous mutation in red and red tabby Persians gave rise to the "peke-faced" Persian, named after the flat-faced [[Pekingese]] dog. It was registered as a distinct breed in the CFA, but fell out of favor by the mid-1990s due to serious health issues; only 98 were registered between 1958 and 1995. Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called ''extreme-'' or ''ultra-typing'') produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to red and red tabby Persians bearing the mutation. Many fanciers and CFA judges considered the shift in look "a contribution to the breed."&lt;ref name="messybeastLHC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CFA Saunders"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lorraine |last=Saunders |title=Solid Color Persians Are...Solid As a Rock? |work=Cat Fanciers' Almanac |date=November 2002 |publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association  |url= http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/articles/persian-solid02.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201041221/http://cfainc.org//breeds/profiles/articles/persian-solid02.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CFA Brocato"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Judy|last1=Brocato |first2=Greg|last2=Brocato |title=Stargazing: A Historical View of Solid Color Persians |work=Cat Fanciers' Almanac |publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association |date=March 1995 |url=http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/articles/persian-solid.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201043934/http://cfainc.org//breeds/profiles/articles/persian-solid.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ultracat"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hartwell |first=Sarah |title=Novelty Breeds and Ultra-Cats – A Breed Too Far? |work=Messybeast Cats |url= http://www.messybeast.com/ultracat.htm |date=2010 |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}{{self-published inline|certain=y|reason=See previous note about this source.|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, breeder and author P. M. Soderberg wrote in ''Pedigree Cats, Their Varieties, breeding and Exhibition''&lt;ref name="ultracat" /&gt;&lt;!--This quotation appears to be cited to an intermediary source; should be verified.--&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;!--Have to compensate with padding, because blockquote's default indentation effect does not work when surrounded by images.--&gt;
"Perhaps in recent times there has been a tendency to over-accentuate this type of short face, with the result that a few of the cats seen at shows have faces which present a peke-like appearance. This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the [Persian] breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur on each side of the nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance [...] The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted. A nose of this type creates an impression of grotesqueness which is not really attractive, and there is always a danger of running eyes."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Stephanie 2.jpg|thumb|right|A smoke Persian with moderate features.]]
While the looks of the Persian changed, the Persian Breed Council's standard for the Persian had remained basically the same. The Persian breed standard is, by its nature, somewhat open-ended and focused on a rounded head, large, wide-spaced round eyes with the top of the nose leather placed no lower than the bottom of the eyes.{{clarify|date=December 2011|reason=Again, this article appears to contradict itself; the breed standard cannot call for the nose to be both above and below the eye at the same time. If necessary, create a section on conflicting breed standards and source their differences.}} The standard calls for a short, cobby body with short, well-boned legs, a broad chest, and a round appearance, everything about the ideal Persian cat being "round". It was not until the late 1980s that standards were changed to limit the development of the extreme appearance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In 2004, the statement that muzzles should not be overly pronounced was added to the breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianbc.org/bcpoll_2003.php|title=2003 Breed Council Ballot Proposals and Results|year=2004|publisher=CFA Persian Breed Council|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards were altered yet again in 2007, this time to reflect the flat face, and it now states that the forehead, nose, and chin should be in vertical alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianbc.org/bcpoll_2006.php|title=2006 Breed Council Ballot Proposals and Results|year=2007|publisher=CFA Persian Breed Council|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the standard was changed by the [[Governing Council of the Cat Fancy]] (GCCF) in the 1990s to disqualify Persians with the "upper edge of the nose leather above the lower edge of the eye" from Certificates or First Prizes in Kitten Open Classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/articles/persian-bicolor.html Bi-Color and Calico Persians: Past, Present and Future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827102947/http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/articles/persian-bicolor.html |date=August 27, 2009 }} Cat Fanciers' Almanac. May 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCF std" /&gt;

While ultra-typed cats do better in the show ring, the public seems to prefer the less extreme, older "doll-face" types.&lt;ref name="messybeastLHC"/&gt;

===Himalayan===
{{Main|Himalayan cat}}
[[File:Chocolate Himlayan.jpg|thumb|right|The Himalayan or Colorpoint Longhair was created by crossing the Persian with the Siamese. This crossing also introduced the chocolate and lilac colors into solid colored Persians.]]
In 1950, the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] was crossed with the Persian to create a breed with the body type of the Persian but colorpoint pattern of the Siamese. It was named [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan]], after other colorpoint animals such as the [[List of rabbit breeds#Himalayan|Himalayan rabbit]]. In the UK, the breed was recognized as the Colorpoint Longhair. The Himalayan stood as a separate breed in the US until 1984, when the CFA merged it with the Persian, to the objection of the breed councils of both breeds. Some Persian breeders were unhappy with the introduction of this [[crossbreed]] into their "pure" Persian lines.&lt;ref name="Helgren3"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

The CFA set up the registration for Himalayans in a way that breeders would be able to discern a Persian with Himalayan ancestry just by looking at the pedigree registration number. This was to make it easy for breeders who do not want Himalayan blood in their breeding lines to avoid individuals who, while not necessarily exhibiting the colorpoint pattern, may be carrying the point coloration gene recessively. Persians with Himalayan ancestry has registration numbers starting with 3 and are commonly referred to by breeders as colorpoint carriers (CPC) or 3000-series cats, although not all will actually carry the recessive gene. The Siamese is also the source for the chocolate and lilac color in solid Persians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/persian-solid.html Breed Profile: Persian – Solid Color Division] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917091248/http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/persian-solid.html |date=September 17, 2009 }} Cat Fanciers' Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfainc.org/org/minutes/Jun04.pdf|format=PDF|title=CFA ANNUAL AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETINGS JUNE 23–27, 2004|website=cfainc.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613043435/http://cfainc.org/org/minutes/Jun04.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- first ref for info on chocolate and lilac color, second for the 3000 series stuff. --&gt;

===Exotic Shorthair===
{{Main|Exotic Shorthair}}
[[File:Brown Exotic Shorthair Kitten.jpg|thumb|right|The Exotic Shorthair is similar to the Persian in temperament and type, with the exception of its short, dense coat.]]
The Persian was used as an outcross secretly by some [[American Shorthair]] (ASH) breeders in the late 1950s to "improve" their breed. The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.

One ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed and eventually managed to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name [[Exotic Shorthair]]. Regular outcrossing to the Persian has made present day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way, including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems. The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair the lazy person's Persian.

Because of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians. Other associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.&lt;ref name="Helgren4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

===Toy and teacup sizes===
A number of breeders produce small-stature Persian cats under a variety of names.  The generic terms are "toy" and "teacup" Persians (terms borrowed from the [[dog fancy]]), but the individual lines are often called "palm-sized", "pocket", "mini" and "pixie". Currently, they are not recognized as a separate breed by major registries and each breeder sets their own standards for size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hartwell|first=Sarah |title=Dwarf, Midget and Miniature Cats – Purebreds (Including 'Teacup Cats') |date=2013 |work=Messybeast Cats |url= http://www.messybeast.com/dwarfcats-purebred.htm |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}{{self-published inline|certain=y|reason=See previous note about this source.|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These terms are considered controversial or marketing ploys as cats do not have the genetic mutations that dogs possess to produce miniature versions of themselves as cats have a strong genetic buffering mechanism that keeps the genes from mutating.  Unscrupulous breeders have resorted to harmful and repetitive inbreeding to obtain smaller cats resulting in genetically weaker cats often with severe health issues and shortened lifespans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/breeding-cats-and-dogs/|title=Breeding Cats and Dogs|work=indianapublicmedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kittentoob.com/cat-breeds/think-twice-buy-teacup-persian-cat/|title=Think Twice Before you Buy A Teacup Persian Cat|date=November 25, 2014|work=kittentoob.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinchilla Longhair and Sterling===
[[File:Doll face silver Persian.jpg|thumb|left|A doll-face silver Persian.]]
In the US, there was an attempt to establish the silver Persian as a separate breed called the Sterling, but it was not accepted. Silver and golden Persians are recognized, as such, by CFA. In [[South Africa]], the attempt to separate the breed was more successful; the [[Southern Africa Cat Council]] (SACC) registers cats with five generations of purebred Chinchilla as a Chinchilla Longhair. The Chinchilla Longhair has a slightly longer nose than the Persian, resulting in healthy breathing and less eye tearing. Its hair is translucent with only the tips carrying black pigment, a feature that gets lost when out-crossed to other colored Persians. Out-crossing also may result in losing nose and lip liner, which is a fault in the Chinchilla Longhair breed standard. One of the distinctions of this breed is the blue-green or green eye color only with kittens having blue or blue-purple eye color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinchillafactssite.com/chinchillas-as-pets/persian-longhair-cat/#appearance Difference Between Chinchilla Rodent and Chinchilla Cat] Chinchillafactssite.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[breed standard]]s of various cat fancier organizations may treat the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair (or simply Exotic) as variants of the Persian, or as separate breeds.  The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) treats the Himalayan as a color-pattern class of both the Persian and the Exotic, which have separate but nearly identical standards (differing in coat length).&lt;ref name="CFA std" /&gt; The [[Fédération Internationale Féline]] (FIFe) entirely subsumes what other registries call the Himalayan as simply among the allowed coloration patterns for the Persian and the Exotic, treated as separate breeds.&lt;ref name="FIFe std"&gt;{{cite web |title=Category I: Exotic/Persian |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 1, 2015 |format=PDF |work=FIFeweb.org |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale Féline]] |location=Jevišovkou, Czech Republic |url= http://www1.fifeweb.org/dnld/std/EXO-PER.pdf |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Cat Association (TICA) treats them both as variants of the Persian.&lt;ref name="TICA std" /&gt;  The [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF) treats the Persian and Exotic Shorthair as separate breeds, and subsumes the Himalayan coloration as colorpoint varieties under each.&lt;ref name="WFC std"&gt;{{cite web |title=Breed Standards: Persian&amp;ndash;Colourpoint |format=PDF |date=January 1, 2010 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=WCF-Online.de |publisher=World Cat Federation |location=Essen, Germany |url= http://www.wcf-online.de/WCF-EN/library/PER_en_2010-01-01.pdf

==Characteristics==
A show-style Persian has an extremely long and thick coat, short legs, a wide head with the ears set far apart, large eyes, and an extremely shortened muzzle.  The breed was originally established with a short muzzle, but over time, this characteristic has become extremely exaggerated, particularly in North America. Persian cats can have virtually any color or markings.

The Persian is generally described as a quiet cat. Typically placid in nature, it adapts quite well to apartment life. Himalayans tend to be more active due to the influence of Siamese traits. In a study comparing cat owner perceptions of their cats, Persians rated higher than non-pedigree cats on closeness and affection to owners, friendliness towards strangers, cleanliness, predictability, vocalization, and fussiness over food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=D.

===Coloration===
&lt;!--Do not capitalize coloration terms; those are not breed names, and this is not Capitalipedia.--&gt;
The permissible colors in the breed, in most organizations' breed standards, encompass the entire range of [[Cat coat genetics|cat coat-pattern variations]].

The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), of the United States, groups the breed into four coat-pattern divisions, but differently: solid, silver and golden (including chinchilla and shaded variants, and blued subvariants), shaded and smoke (with several variations of each, and a third sub-categorization called shell), tabby (only classic, mackerel, and patched [spotted], in various colors), parti-color (in four classes, tortoiseshell, blue-cream, chocolate tortie, and lilac-cream, mixed with other colors), [[Calico cat|calico]] and bi-color (in around 40 variations, broadly classified as calico, dilute calico, and bi-color), and Himalayan (white-to-fawn body with [[point coloration]] on the head, tail and limbs, in various tints).  CFA base colors are white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, and lilac.  There are around 140 named CFA coat patterns for which the Himalayan qualifies, and 20 for the Himalayan sub breed.&lt;ref name="CFA std"&gt;{{cite web |title=Persian Show Standard |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=CFAInc.com |publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association |location=Alliance, Ohio |date=2015 |format=PDF |url= http://www.cfainc.org/Portals/0/documents/breeds/standards/persian.pdf |accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These coat patterns encompass virtually all of those recognized by CFA for cats generally.  Any Persian permissible in TICA's more detailed system would probably be accepted in CFA's, simply with a more general name, though the organizations do not mix breed registries. [[File:GC RW Topknot James Bond of Lions &amp; Owls RW Best Black Persian 2016-2017.jpg|thumb|Grand Champion Topknot James Bond of Lions &amp; Owls RW Best Black Persian 2016-2017.

Note the immense ruff, small round ears, heavy-boned, cobby body, and nose that is short, snub, and broad, with “break” centered between the eyes.]]

[[The International Cat Association]] (TICA) groups the breed into three coat-pattern divisions for judging at [[cat show]]s: traditional (with stable, rich colors), sepia ("paler and warmer than the traditional equivalents", and darkening a bit with age), and mink (much lighter than sepia, and developing noticeably with age on the face and extremities).  If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full [[point coloration]] is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a "pale and creamy colored" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points.  Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] (or "tortie"), [[Tabby cat|tabby]], silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled.  Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, "blue" (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies. The Exotic Shorthair sub-breed qualifies for every cat coat variation TICA recognizes.&lt;ref name="TICA std" /&gt;
&lt;!-- FIFe here --&gt;
&lt;!-- Australian Cat Federation here.--&gt;

Eye colors range widely, and may include blue, copper, [[Odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] blue and copper, green, blue-green, and hazel.  Various TICA and CFA coat categorizations come with specific eye-color requirements.&lt;ref name="TICA std" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CFA std" /&gt;

The modern [[Brachycephalic syndrome|brachycephalic]] Persian has a large rounded skull and shortened face and nose.

Because of DNA testing, most responsible Persian breeders now have cats that no longer carry the PKD gene, hence their offspring also do not have the gene.  Before DNA screening was available, ultrasound was done.  However, an ultrasound is only as good as the day it's done, and many cats that were thought to be clear, were in fact, a carrier of the PKD gene.  Only DNA screening and then breeding negative to negative for the PKD gene will produce negative kittens which effectively removes this gene from the breeding pool has allowed some lines and catteries to  eliminate the incidence  of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Leslie.

[[Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HCM) is a common heart disease in all cats. It is hereditary in the [[Maine Coon]] and [[American Shorthair]], and likely the Persian. The disease causes thickening of the [[left ventricle|left heart chamber]], which can in some instances lead to sudden death. It tends to affect males and mid to old-aged individuals. Reported incidence rate in Persians is 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gary D.|last1=Norsworthy|first2=Mitchell A.|last2=Crystal|first3=Sharon|last3=Fooshee Grace|first4=Larry P.|last4=Tilley|title=The Feline Patient|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aSMmFN4TQYC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-7817-6268-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike PKD which can be detected even in very young cats, heart tests for HCM have to be done regularly in order to effective track and/or remove affected individuals and their offspring from the breeding pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.org/articles/health/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy.html Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Advice for Breeders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513083815/http://www.cfa.org/articles/health/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy.html |date=May 13, 2008 }} The Winn Feline Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The age at the first cardiac event was significantly lower in Maine Coons (2.5 years) versus other breeds (7 years). In Sphynx, the age at the time of diagnosis was 3.5 years. Concerning sudden death solely, Maine Coon cats died younger than other breeds. No sudden deaths were reported in Chartreux and Persian cats in this study. Sudden death was observed in only 3 breeds—Maine Coon, Domestic Shorthair, and Sphynx. All cats surviving longer than 15 years of age were Domestic Shorthair, Persians, or Chartreux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Grooming==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Lion cut tortoiseshell Persian.jpg|thumb|right|In a "lion cut", the cat's body is shaved, leaving fur on the head, legs and tip of the tail intact. It may be done to remove matted fur, reduce the need for grooming, keep the cat cool in warm weather or for aesthetic reasons.]]
Since Persian cats have long, dense fur that they cannot effectively keep clean, they need regular [[Personal grooming|grooming]] to prevent matting. To keep their fur in its best condition, they must be brushed frequently. Some advocate for bathing the cats in water, although many Persians are fine cleaning themselves. An alternative is to shave the coat. Their eyes may require regular cleaning to prevent crust buildup and tear staining.

==Persian Cats in Art==
The art world and its patrons have long embraced their love for the Persian cat by immortalizing them in art.  A 6-by-8.5-foot artwork that’s purported to be the “world’s largest cat painting” sold at auction for more than $820,000. The late 19th-century oil portrait is called My Wife's Lovers, and it once belonged to a wealthy philanthropist who commissioned an artist to paint her vast assortment of Turkish [[Angora cat|Angoras]] and Persians. Other popular Persian paintings include White Persian Cat by famous folk artist Warren Kimble and Two White Persian Cats Looking into a Goldfish Bowl by late feline portraitist [[Arthur Heyer]]. The beloved Persian cat has made its way onto the artwork of stamps around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70373/sothebys-auctioning-what-might-be-worlds-largest-cat-painting|title=Sotheby's Is Auctioning Off What Might Be the World's Largest Cat Painting|date=October 26, 2015|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/carl-kahler-my-wifes-lovers-auction|title=Carl Kahler My Wife’s Lovers Auction {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71010/10-fancy-facts-about-persian-cats|title=10 Fancy Facts About Persian Cats|date=November 20, 2015|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iheartcats.com/u-s-postal-stamps-will-feature-cats-in-2016/|title=U.S. Postal Stamps Will Feature Cats In 2016|work=iHeartCats.com – Because Every Cat Matters ™|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

This is not to be confused with the medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number and outcomes of pregnancy ([[gravidity and parity]]).

A woman giving birth in a hospital may leave as soon as she is medically stable, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for [[spontaneous vaginal delivery|a vaginal birth]] is one to two days. The average [[caesarean section]] postnatal stay is three to four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recovering from a caesarean section|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/Pages/Recovery.aspx|website=NHS Choices|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the mother is monitored for bleeding, bowel and bladder function, and baby care. The infant's health is also monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = With Women, Midwives Experiences: from Shiftwork to Continuity of Care | first = David | last = Vernon | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Australian College of Midwives | location = Canberra | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-9751674-5-8 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early postnatal hospital discharge]] is typically defined as discharge of the mother and newborn from the hospital within 48 hours of birth.

The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, 6–12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts 2–6 weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="Glazener_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazener CM, Abdalla M, Stroud P, Naji S, Templeton A, Russell IT | title = Postnatal maternal morbidity: extent, causes, prevention and treatment | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–7 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7612509 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1995.tb09132.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Roberts CL, Currie M, Ellwood DA | title = Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth | journal = Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12051189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borders N | title = After the afterbirth: a critical review of postpartum health relative to method of delivery | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–248 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16814217 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acute phase ==
[[File:Postpartum_baby2.jpg|thumb|Infant placed directly on the chest following childbirth]]
[[File:Front View of Postpartum Uterine Massage.png|thumb|Postpartum uterine massage helps the uterus to contract after the placenta has been expelled in the acute phase.]]
The first 6 to 12 hours after childbirth is the initial or acute phase of the postpartum period.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; During this time the mother is typically monitored by nurses or midwives as complications can arise in this period.

The greatest health risk in the acute phase is [[postpartum bleeding]]. Following delivery the area where the placenta was attached to the uterine wall bleeds, and the uterus must contract to prevent blood loss. After contraction takes place the fundus (top) of the uterus can be palpated as a firm mass at the level of the navel. It is important that the uterus remains firm and the nurse or midwife will make frequent assessments of both the fundus and the amount of bleeding. Uterine massage is commonly used to help the uterus contract.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic" /&gt;

Following delivery if the mother had an [[episiotomy]] or tearing at the opening of the vagina, it is stitched.  At one time an episiotomy was routine, however more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.  A healthcare professional can recommend comfort measures to help to ease [[Perineum|perineal]] pain&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/episiotomy/ART-20047282?p=1 | title=Labor and delivery, postpartum care | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=30 July 2015 | access-date=15 August 2015 | author=Mayo Clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant caring in the acute phase ===
[[File:A few moments more.jpg|thumb|Infant nursing shortly after birth]]
Within about 10 seconds the infant takes its first breath and the caregiver places the baby on the mother's chest.  The infant's condition is evaluated using the [[Apgar scale]].  The 
Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five criteria which are summarized using words chosen to form a [[backronym]] ('''A'''ppearance, '''P'''ulse, '''G'''rimace, '''A'''ctivity, '''R'''espiration). Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact, also called [[kangaroo care]], is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants. Thus, to help establish bonding and successful [[breastfeeding]], the caregiver carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother's chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.  The [[World Health Organization]]  (WHO) also encourages skin-to-skin contact for the first 24 hours after birth to help regulate the baby's temperature.&lt;ref name="Medscape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9|title=Uninterrupted Skin-to-Skin Contact Immediately After Birth| last = Phillips | first = Raylene | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Medscape | access-date = 21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subacute postpartum period ==
The subacute postpartum starts after the acute postpatrum period concludes and can last for 2–6 weeks.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt;

In the first few days following childbirth, the risk of [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]] is relatively high as [[Hypercoagulability in pregnancy|hypercoagulability increases during pregnancy]] and is maximal in the postpartum period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiengo L, Bucci F, Patrizi G, Giannotti D, Redler A | title = Postpartum deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in twin pregnancy: undertaking of clinical symptoms leading to massive complications | journal = Thrombosis Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23433174 | pmc = 3629711 | doi = 10.1186/1477-9560-11-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for women with C-section with reduced mobility. [[Anticoagulant|Anti-coagulants]] may be prescribed or physical methods such as [[Compression stockings|compression]] are commonly indicated to decrease the risk of DVT.

The increased [[vascularity]] and [[edema]] of the woman's vagina gradually resolves in about three weeks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[cervix]] gradually narrows and lengths over a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/Article?contentid=415&amp;language=English|title=Childbirth recovery and postpartum care|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aboutkidshealth.ca|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postpartum infections]] can lead to [[sepsis]] and if untreated, death.&lt;ref name="WHO postnatal care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=World Health Organization | date=2013 | access-date=22 December 2014 | author=WHO | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222172315/http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | archive-date=22 December 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum [[urinary incontinence]] is experienced by about 33% of all women; women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a cesarean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom DH, Rortveit G | title = Prevalence of postpartum urinary incontinence: a systematic review | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 1511–22 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21050146 | doi = 10.3109/00016349.2010.526188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary incontinence in this period increases the risk of long term incontinence.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt;
[[File:Adult diapers in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Adult diapers may be worn in the subacute postpartum period for lochia, as well as urinary and fecal incontinence.]]
Discharge from the uterus, called [[lochia]], will gradually decrease and turn from bright red, to brownish, to yellow and cease at around five or six weeks. Women are advised in this period to wear [[adult diaper]]s or nappies, [[disposable maternity briefs]], maternity pads or towels, or [[sanitary napkin]]s. The use of [[tampon]]s or [[menstrual cup]]s are contraindicated as they may introduce bacteria and increase the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2511.aspx?CategoryID=60|title=How soon can I use tampons after giving birth?|last=N.

Choices|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in lochia between 7–14 days postpartum may indicate delayed postpartum [[hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="Kansky_2016" /&gt;

[[Hemorrhoid]]s and [[constipation]] in this period are common, and [[Laxative|stool softeners]] are routinely given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-hemorrhoids_11708.bc|title=Postpartum Hemmorhoids|last=|first=|date=|website=Baby Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="Glazener_1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson_2002" /&gt;

=== Infant caring in the subacute period ===
At 2–4 days postpartum, a woman's milk will generally come in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/breastfeeding-first-days/|title=Breastfeeding: the first few days|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, women who were not breastfeeding were given drugs to [[Lactation suppression|suppress lactation]], but this is no longer medically indicated. In this period, [[Breastfeeding difficulties|difficulties with breastfeeding]] may arise. Maternal sleep is often disturbed as night waking is normal in the newborn, and newborns need to be fed every two hours, including during the night.&lt;ref name="McGuire_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGuire E | title = Maternal and infant sleep postpartum | journal = Breastfeeding Review | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 38–41 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23957180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lactation consultant]] and [[health visitor]] may be of assistance at this time.

===Psychological disorders===
{{See also|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth}}During the subacute postpartum period, psychological disorders may emerge. Among these are [[postpartum depression]], [[Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder]], and in rare cases, [[puerperal psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobson V, Sales B | year=2000|title=The Science of Infanticide and Mental Illness|url=|journal=Psychology, Public Policy and Law|location=|publisher=|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1098–1112|doi=10.1037/1076-8971.6.4.1098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum mental illness can affect both mothers and fathers, and is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmha.ca/mental_health/postpartum-depression/|title=Postpartum Depression|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Mental Health Association|publisher=|access-date=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early detection and adequate treatment is required. Approximately 25% – 85% of postpartum women will experience the "blues" for a few days. Between 7% and 17% may experience clinical depression, with a higher risk among those women with a history of clinical depression.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8 and 5.6% at 6 weeks postpartum.&lt;ref name="Olde_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olde E, van der Hart O, Kleber R, van Son M | title = Posttraumatic stress following childbirth: a review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16176853 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Delayed postpartum period ==
The delayed postpartum period starts after the subacute postpartum period and lasts up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; During this time, muscles and connective tissue returns to a pre-pregnancy state. Recovery from childbirth complications in this period, such as [[Urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]], [[Dyspareunia|painful intercourse]], and [[Pelvic organ prolapse|pelvic prolapse]], are typically very slow and in some cases may not resolve.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; Symptoms of [[Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] often subside in this period, dropping from 2.8 and 5.6% at 6 weeks postpartum to 1.5% at 6 months postpartum.&lt;ref name="Olde_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alder2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alder J, Stadlmayr W, Tschudin S, Bitzer J | title = Post-traumatic symptoms after childbirth: what should we offer? | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–12 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16808085 | doi = 10.1080/01674820600714632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately three months after giving birth (typically between 2 and 5 months), [[estrogen]] levels drop and large amounts of [[Hair loss#Pregnancy|hair loss]] is common, particularly in the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] area (postpartum alopecia). Hair typically grows back normally and treatment is not indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHIFF|first=BENCEL L.|date=1963-05-01|title=Study of Postpartum Alopecia|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/527997|journal=Archives of Dermatology|language=en|volume=87|issue=5|pages=609|doi=10.1001/archderm.1963.01590170067011|issn=0003-987X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eastham|first=John H|date=February 2001|title=Postpartum Alopecia|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1345/aph.10153|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|volume=35|pages=255–258|doi=10.1345/1542-6270(2001)035&lt;0255:pa&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=1060-0280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions that may arise in this period include [[postpartum thyroiditis]].

During this period, infant sleep during the night gradually increases and maternal sleep generally improves.&lt;ref name="McGuire_2013" /&gt;

Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders_2006" /&gt;

==Cultures==
{{Main|Postpartum confinement}}

As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving.]]

Postpartum confinement refers to a system for recovery following childbirth. It begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days,&lt;ref name="Chien_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chien YC, Huang YJ, Hsu CS, Chao JC, Liu JF | title = Maternal lactation characteristics after consumption of an alcoholic soup during the postpartum 'doing-the-month' ritual | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 382–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 18426631 | doi = 10.1017/S1368980008002152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; up to 40 days, two months or 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1021145/confinement-practices-an-overview|title=Confinement practices: an overview|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postnatal recuperation can include "traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tung|first1=Wei-Chen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Doing the Month and Asian Cultures: Implications for Health Care|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=22 June 2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=369–371|doi=10.1177/1084822310367473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice used to be known as "[[lying-in]]", which, as the term suggests, centres around [[bed rest]]. ([[Maternity hospital]]s used to use this phrase, as in the [[General Lying-in Hospital]].) Postpartum confinement customs are well-documented in China, where it is known as "Sitting the month", and similar customs manifest all over the world. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labour and delivery.{{Nonspecific|date=August 2018}}

In other cultures like in South Korea, a great level of importance is placed on postnatal care. [[Sanhujori]] is the term for traditional postnatal care in Korea and is a practice followed by the majority of women for the purpose of proper recovery after giving birth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Eun Kwang|last2=Jung|first2=Eun Sil|date=2016|title=Outlook of sanhujori from Korean women residing in the US|url=http://onlinepresent.org/proceedings/vol128_2016/39.pdf|journal=Advanced Science and Technology Letters|volume=128|pages=203-207|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Deeply rooted in Korean culture, sanhujori has similarly evolved with today’s society from being heavily reliant on the mothers’ family members to include services that encompass its principles, which is apparent with the over 500 sanhujori centers in operation around Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Eun Kwang|last2=Kim|first2=Hye Jin|date=2016|title=Unmarried Single Women’s Awareness of Sanhujori|url=http://onlinepresent.org/proceedings/vol128_2016/35.pdf|journal=Advanced Science and Technology Letters|volume=128|pages=183-187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Prayas Nepal''' is a non-profit, non-governmental organization in Nepal. It is registered with the District Administrative Office of Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRAYAS NEPAL|url=http://crinarchive.org/Organisations/viewOrg.asp?ID=3665|website=Child Rights International Network|publisher=Child Rights International Network|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayas Nepal aims to protect the rights of children and the underprivileged including orphans, women and elderly in Nepal by helping them to access essential services such as education and health care.

== History and Development ==

June 2003: Prayas Nepal established the children's home in a rented house with the capacity to accommodate 10 orphans and underprivileged children of Nepal.

2005: In response to the needs and problems of street children in Kathmandu, Prayas Nepal launched a new programme named Children for Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kathmandu's street children, their addiction|url=http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=14322|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=Republica|publisher=Republica|date=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 2005: Due to the increasing number of orphan and abandoned children being accepted, Prayas Nepal acquired its own premises in Baluwatar, Kathmandu, which can accommodate 45 children, with the help of donors.

2006: Prayas Nepal launched its first programme targeting women through supporting female employment – Women Empowerment Program.

July 2007: Responding to the serious floods in some areas of Nepal, Prayas Nepal assisted in the reconstruction of 42 damaged houses in Dhanusa District by providing building materials.
 
2010: Prayas Nepal started to partner with schools to support their construction and renovation of educational facilities.

== Programmes ==

'''Children’s Home''' - Prayas Nepal currently provides basic nutritional and medical support, formal education support, learning excursions and playtime for 38 children at the children’s home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joshi's passion for social work|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=66078|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=Republica|publisher=Republica|date=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sponsorship Programmes''' - Prayas Nepal offers two types of sponsorship programmes for underprivileged children who live with their own family, namely the full and partial sponsorship programmes. Under the Purna Chhatrabritti (A Full Sponsorship Programme), children can receive overall financial support to complete their one year of schooling. Students granted the Share &amp; Care Sponsorship can obtain partial monetary support from Prayas Nepal according to their need. This sponsorship mainly covers the tuition fee, uniform or school materials of the sponsored child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lama|first1=Sujay|title=Project Nepal|url=http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=13297|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=Nepali Times|issue=#338 (02 MARCH 2007 - 08 MARCH 2007)|publisher=Nepali Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free Community Health Camp Programme''' - Prayas Nepal has established free medical camps in various rural areas in Nepal where there is no easy access to medical care for the underprivileged including children, women and elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Health Camp at Ramechhap District|url=http://www.namaskaronlus.org/media/upl/35_health-camp-at-ramechhap.pdf|website=Associazione Namaskar ONLUS|publisher=Associazione Namaskar ONLUS|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micro Support (Small Aid) Programme''' - Prayas Nepal supports local schools’ purchase of learning materials and local small-scale school infrastructure projects, including water tank construction, science lab and library set-up.

'''Elder Education Programme''' - Prayas Nepal has organized several literacy classes for the elderly in two districts in Nepal – Dhanusa and Rukum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Prayas Nepal|title=1st Progress Report On "Elder Education Project-Rukum"|url=http://www.namaskaronlus.org/media/upl/37_elder-education-1st-progress-report.pdf|website=Associazione Namaskar ONLUS|publisher=Associazione Namaskar ONLUS|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women Empowerment Programme''' - Prayas Nepal equips female victims of conflict and underprivileged women with literacy classes, counseling sessions and tailoring, knitting, weaving, candle-making, incense-making, pickle-making skills and provides them with necessities including shelter and food.

'''“Children for Children”''' - Prayas Nepal has offered counseling services to child street hawkers including drop-outs and drug users to encourage their re-entry to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kathmandu's street children, their addiction|url=http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=14322|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=Republica|publisher=Republica|date=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School Construction and Renovation Project''' - Prayas Nepal assists schools which have inadequate and damaged classrooms and poor facilities with construction and renovation projects by providing technical and financial support including provisions of construction materials. By mid-2014, three projects have been accomplished in three different schools – Shree Nimna Lower Secondary School (Rukum District), Shree Bhumeswori Secondary School (Ramechhap District), and Shree Sunakhani Secondary School (Dhading District).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration Of New School Building|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151250196822912.473106.226977267911&amp;type=3|website=Prayas Nepal Facebook Page|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remineralisation is a natural process and does not have to involve fluoride.]]

'''Tooth remineralisation''' is a naturally occurring process in the [[mouth|oral cavity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fejerskov, O., Nyvad, Bente, &amp; Kidd, Edwina A. M. (2015). Dental caries : The disease and its clinical management (Third ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as a process in which [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] [[ion]]s are sourced to promote ion [[deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] into crystal voids in demineralised enamel. Remineralisation remains imperative towards the management of non-cavitated [[tooth decay|carious lesions]] and prevention of disease progression within the oral cavity. The process also has the ability to contribute towards restoring strength and function within tooth structure.&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane NJ, Cai F, Huq NL, Burrow MF, Reynolds EC. New approaches to enhanced remineralization of tooth enamel. Journal of Dental Research. 2010 Nov 1;89(11):1187-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tooth demineralization is a chemical process by which minerals (mainly calcium) are removed from any of the hard tissues: [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentine]], and [[cementum]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Li X, Wang J, Joiner A, Chang J. The remineralisation of enamel: a review of the literature. Journal of dentistry. 2014 Jun 30;42:S12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of demineralization begins at the crystal surface found inside the hard tooth tissue and may progress into cavitation unless arrested or overridden by remineralisation. The effect of demineralisation can be reversed if there is sufficient time to allow remineralisation to occur to counteract the acids in the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia- Godoy, F. &amp; Hicks, J. (2008). Maintaining the integrity of the enamel surface. American Dental Association, 139(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Together, demineralisation and remineralisation contribute towards a dynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks J, Garcia-Godoy F, Flaitz C. Biological factors in dental caries: role of saliva and dental plaque in the dynamic process of demineralization and remineralization (part 1). Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry. 2004 Sep 1;28(1):47-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tooth decay process==

The initiation of the caries process is triggered by an increase in the acidity of bacterial plaque. The process of [[dental caries]] occurs when the acid-producing bacteria found in dental plaque on teeth feed on fermentable carbohydrates and produce organic acids as by-products.&lt;ref&gt;Featherstone JD. Dental caries: a dynamic disease process. Australian dental journal. 2008 Sep 1;53(3):286-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The acids diffuse into the tooth surface and dissolve the carbonated [[hydroxyapatite]] mineral that consecutively forms a carious lesion. When food or drinks containing sugars enter the mouth, the bacteria within the plaque rapidly convert the sugars into acid. The plaque can hold the acid in contact with the tooth surface for up to two hours before it is neutralised by saliva. During the time that the plaque is acidic, some of the [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] minerals are dissolved out of the enamel into the plaque and once the plaque acid has been neutralised the minerals can return to the enamel surface. However the capacity for remineralisation is limited and if sugars enter the mouth too frequently a net loss of mineral from the enamel surface results in a cavity through which bacteria can penetrate and infect the inner structure of the tooth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although a key feature of [[tooth decay]] is the increase of bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' in dental plaque, it is not considered as an [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Tooth decay can be managed by modifying behavior and controlling its causative factors, i.e. reducing the intake frequency of fermentable carbohydrates from food. This will reduce the chance of the dental [[biofilm]] developing into cariogenic biofilm. The bacteria in cariogenic biofilm produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten. When enough acid is produced so that the [[pH]] goes below 5.5, the acid dissolves [[carbonate]]d [[hydroxyapatite]], the main component of [[tooth enamel]], in a process known as ''demineralisation''.&lt;ref&gt;Fejerskov O, Nyvad B, Kidd EA: Pathology of dental caries; in Fejerskov O, Kidd EAM (eds): Dental caries: The disease and its clinical management. Oxford, Blackwell Munksgaard, 2008, vol 2, pp 20-48.&lt;/ref&gt; After the sugar is gone, the mineral loss can be recovered—or ''remineralised''—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of demineralisation exceeds the rate of remineralisation and the latticework is destroyed,  typically in a process that requires many months or years.&lt;ref&gt;Soi S, Roy AS, Vinayak V.

== Natural Tooth Remineralisation ==

=== Role of saliva ===
Saliva, being the watery substance that constantly circulates the oral cavity, is capable of impacting both the remineralisation and demineralisation processes. It is secreted through the major salivary glands including the parotid, submandibular, sublingual and Von Ebner's glands as well as the hundreds of minor salivary glands that are located throughout the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci, A., &amp; Ten Cate, A. (2008). ''Ten Cate's oral histology''. St. Louis, Mo.: Mosby Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remineralization occurs on a daily basis after an acidogenic challenge through the presence of saliva.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Calcium, phosphate and fluoride found in saliva, are required for effective remineralization and maintenance of the enamel surface integrity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García-Godoy|first=Franklin|last2=Hicks|first2=M. John|date=2008-05-01|title=Maintaining the integrity of the enamel surface: The role of dental biofilm, saliva and preventive agents in enamel demineralization and remineralization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817714638794|journal=The Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=139, Supplement 2|pages=25S–34S|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as saliva is rich in calcium and phosphate ions, it can act as a natural buffer to neutralise acid and allow demineralised tooth tissues to be remineralised.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If there is reduced saliva flow or reduced saliva quality, this will increase the risk of demineralization and create the need for treatment in order to prevent demineralisation progression.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Saliva function can be organised into five major categories that serve to maintain oral health and create an appropriate ecologic balance:

* Lubrication and protection
* Buffering action and clearance
* Maintenance of tooth integrity
* Antibacterial activity
* Taste and digestion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

As the demineralisation process continues, the pH of the mouth becomes more acidic which promotes the development of cavities. Dissolved minerals then diffuse out of the tooth structure and into the saliva surrounding the tooth. The buffering capacity of saliva greatly impacts the pH of plaque surrounding the enamel, thereby inhibiting caries progression. Plaque thickness and the number of bacteria present determine the effectiveness of salivary buffers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The high salivary concentrations of calcium and phosphate which are maintained by salivary proteins may account for the development and remineralisation of enamel. The presence of fluoride in saliva speeds up crystal precipitation forming a fluorapatite- like coating which will be more resistant to caries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Tooth Remineralisation Treatments &amp; Preventative Strategies==
Besides professional dental care, there are other ways for promoting tooth remineralisation:

=== Fluoride ===

==== Fluoride therapy ====
[[Fluoride]] is a mineral found naturally in rock, air, soil, plants and water and it assists by:

* Protecting children and adults against tooth decay
* Repairing early white spot lesions found on the tooth surface that may develop into cavities.
* Helps prevent premature tooth loss of baby teeth due to decay and overall assists in guiding the adult teeth to correct [[tooth eruption]].
* Aids in the prevention of invasive dental treatment therefore reducing the amount of money spent on dental treatment
* Provides an overall community advantage, especially individuals from low socioeconomic communities, who have less access to other forms of fluoride treatments
* Evidence confirms that water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to help protect teeth against decay
* The addition of fluoride to the water does not alter the taste or smell of the drinking water

[[Fluoride therapy]] is often used to promote remineralisation. This produces the stronger and more acid-resistant [[fluorapatite]], rather than the natural [[hydroxyapatite]]. Both materials are made of calcium. In fluorapatite, fluoride takes the place of a [[hydroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Better health channel. "Dental care - fluoride", April 2012. retrieved on 2016-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect of fluoride====
The presence of fluoride in saliva and plaque fluid interacts with remineralisation process in many ways and thus exerts a [[topical]] or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04&amp;nbsp;mg/L several times during a day.&lt;ref name="Pizzo"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Piscopo|first2=M. R.|last3=Pizzo|first3=I.|last4=Giuliana|first4=G.|year=2007|title=Community Water Fluoridation and Caries Prevention: A Critical Review|url=http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/chris/Pizzo-2007.pdf|journal=Clinical Oral Investigations|volume=11|issue=3|pages=189–193|doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6|pmc=|pmid=17333303|last1=Pizzo|first1=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop making them take a lot longer and making them easier to prevent via normal brushing as it will take a higher amount of acid, usually built up over a number of days, to destroy the created fluorapatite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Fejerskov|first2=O.|year=2002|title=Dental Fluorosis: Chemistry and Biology|journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–70|doi=10.1177/154411130201300206|pmc=|pmid=12097358|last1=Aoba|first1=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5,&lt;ref name="Cury"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Tenuta|first2=L.

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluorapatite-like remineralised [[Veneer (dentistry)|veneer]] is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralised enamel would be.&lt;ref name="Featherstone" /&gt; The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is partly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after [[tooth eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Lennon|first2=Á. M.|year=2004|title=Systemic versus Topical Fluoride|journal=Caries Research|volume=38|issue=3|pages=258–262|doi=10.1159/000077764|pmc=|pmid=15153698|last1=Hellwig|first1=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride interferes with the process of tooth decay as fluoride intake during the period of enamel development for up to 7 years of age; the fluoride alters the structure of the developing enamel making it more resistant to acid attack.  In children and adults when teeth are subjected to the alternating stages of demineralisation and remineralisation, the presence of fluoride intake encourages remineralisation and ensures that the enamel crystals that are laid down are of improved quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dr RS Levine. "The British Fluoridation Society", A guide to the action of fluoride in the prevention of dental decay, 2016. retrieved on 2016-05-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride is commonly found in toothpastes. Fluoride can be delivered to many parts of the oral cavity during brushing, including the tooth surface, saliva, soft tissues and remaining plaque biofilm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xiaoke|last2=Wang|first2=Jinfang|last3=Joiner|first3=Andrew|last4=Chang|first4=Jiang|title=The remineralisation of enamel: a review of the literature|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0300571214500036|journal=Journal of Dentistry|volume=42|pages=S12–S20|doi=10.1016/s0300-5712(14)50003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some remineralisation methods may work for "white spot lesions" but not necessarily "intact tooth surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Early detection of white spot lesions with digital camera and remineralization therapy|journal=Australian Dental Journal|volume=53|issue=3|pages=274–280|doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00062.x|pmc=|pmid=18782375|last1=Iijima|first1=Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fluoridated toothpaste====
Regular use of a fluoridated toothpaste has been shown to provide a significant source of fluoride to the mouth by the means of direct fluoride contact to tooth structure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beltrán-Aguilar | first1 =  | last2 = Goldstein | first2 =  | last3 = Lockwood | first3 =  | year = 2000 | title = Fluoride Varnishes: A Review of Their Clinical Use, Cariostatic Mechanism, Efficacy and Safety: A Review of Their Clinical Use, Cariostatic Mechanism, Efficacy and Safety | url = | journal = The Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 131 | issue = 5| pages = 589–596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of fluoride added to toothpaste include: sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP), and stannous fluoride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiegand | first1 = A | last2 = Bichsel | first2 = D | last3 = Magalhães | first3 = AC | last4 = Becker | first4 = K | last5 = Attin | first5 = T | date = Aug 2009 | title = Effect of sodium, amine and stannous fluoride at the same concentration and different pH on in vitro erosion | url = | journal = Journal of Dentistry | volume = 37 | issue = 8| pages = 591–5 | doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2009.03.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated previously, fluoride has been proven to positively affect the remineralisation process. Therefore, by using an adequately fluoridated toothpaste regularly, this assists the remineralisation process of any hard tooth tissues.

==== Fluoride varnish ====
Fluoride varnishes were developed late 1960s and early 1970s and since then they have been used both as a preventative agent in public health programs and as a specific treatment for patients at risk of caries by the 1980s, mostly in European countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Fluoride varnishes were developed primarily to overcome their shortcoming which is to prolong the contact time between fluoride and tooth surfaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, when compared to other existing topical fluoride the advantages of fluoride varnishes application are being a quick and easy procedure for the clinicians, reduced discomfort for the receiving patients, and greater acceptability by the patients. Fluoride varnishes are a concentrated topical fluoride containing 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) except the fulour protector.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are many types of fluoride varnishes and among them the popular brands are Duraphat and Fluor Protector. Currently, the anti-caries effect fluoride varnishes are backed up by Cochrane systematic reviews, 2002 which was updated in 2013 included 22 trials with 12,455 children aged 1–15 years old. The conclusion made is similar to its previous review, a 46% reduction in D(M)FS and 33% reduction in d (e/m)fs in permanent teeth and deciduous teeth respectively &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Water fluoridation ====
Community [[water fluoridation]] is the addition of fluoride in the drinking water with the aim of reducing tooth decay by adjusting the natural fluoride concentration of water to that recommended for improving oral health. The NHMRC released the public statement of efficacy and safety of fluoridation 2007 to set the recommended water fluoridation to the target range of 0.6 to 1.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L, depending on climate, to balance reduction of dental caries (tooth decay) and occurrence of [[dental fluorosis]] (mottling of teeth).  Moreover the public statement states that the fluoridation of drinking water is an effective way to ensure the community is exposed to fluoride and can benefit from its preventative role in tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;National health and medical research council. "Health effects of water fluoridation", 2016-04-06. retrieved on 2016-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plaque control===
Oral hygiene practices involve the mechanical removal of plaque from hard tissue surfaces &lt;ref&gt;Darby ML, Walsh M. Dental hygiene: theory and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences; 2014 Apr 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Cariogenic bacteria levels in the plaque determine whether caries will occur or not, therefore, effective removal of plaque is paramount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hicks|first=John|last2=Garcia-Godoy|first2=Franklin|last3=Flaitz|first3=Catherine|date=2003-01-01|title=Biological factors in dental caries: role of saliva and dental plaque in the dynamic process of demineralization and remineralization (part 1)|journal=The Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=47–52|issn=1053-4628|pmid=14604142|doi=10.17796/jcpd.28.1.yg6m443046k50u20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of plaque inhibits demineralisation of teeth, and reversely increases opportunities for remineralisation.

===Diet===
Demineralization is caused by bacteria excreting acids as a product of their metabolism of carbohydrates. By reducing the intake frequency of carbohydrates in an individual's diet, remineralization is increased and demineralization is decreased. Diet control is an important aspect in promoting remineralization to occur naturally. A loss of the tooth enamel structure and cavitation may occur if the demineralization phase continues for a long period of time. This disturbance of demineralisation caused by the presence of fermentable carbohydrates continues until the saliva has returned to a normal pH and had sufficient time to penetrate and neutralize the acids within any cariogenic biofilm present.&lt;ref&gt;Arathi Rao, Neeraj Malhotra. "The Role of Remineralizing Agents in dentistry: A Review". Volume 32, Number 6. 2011. retrieved on 2016-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased sugar consumption in the means of foods and drinks containing high levels of sugar are known to be associated with high rates of dental decay. As a result, members of the dental team routinely assess patients' diets and highlight areas where this could be improved to reduce the risk of dental decay. A balanced diet is an important contributing factor towards oral health and general health. It is common knowledge that certain dietary habits contribute to disease, whether patients take note of advice which is given to them and change their diet as a result, is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Erik Petersen|first2=Poul|date=2004|title=Diet, nutrition and the prevention of dental diseases|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/public_health_nut7.pdf|journal=Public Health Nutrition|volume=7|issue=1a|pages=201–226|doi=10.1079/PHN2003589|last1=Moynihan|first1=Paula|accessdate=22 May 2016|pmid=14972061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies on diet and caries have been confounded by the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes.  Studies have argued that with greater exposure to fluoride, the sugar consumption/caries relationship may be weaker in the modern age than previously thought, with fluoride raising the threshold of sugar intake at which caries progresses to cavitation. It has been concluded in modern societies that a significant relationship between sugars and caries persists despite the regular widespread use of fluoride toothpaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tenuta|first2=L|date=24 Jan 2014|title=Evidence-based recommendation on toothpaste use|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1806-83242014000200001|journal=Brazilian Oral Research|volume=28|doi=10.1590/S1806-83242014.50000001|last1=Cury|first1=J|accessdate=23 May 2016|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews conclude that high sugar consumption continues to be the main threat for dental health of whole populations in some developed and many developing countries. Therefore, a key strategy to further reducing levels of caries in individuals as well as for populations, is by means of reducing the frequency of sugar intakes in the diet.

Foods high in refined carbohydrates, such as concentrated fruit snack bars, sweets, muesli bars, sweet biscuits, some breakfast cereals and sugary drinks including juices can contribute to dental decay, especially if eaten often and over long periods as the sugar nourishes the cariogenic bacteria in mouth. The bacteria produce acid, which destroys teeth. Highly refined packaged foods such as savory crackers and chips can also have high levels of carbohydrates. It is important to check the nutritional information panel on packaged foods to determine which foods and drinks have high carbohydrate concentrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Jan–Feb 2011|title=Eating habits for a healthy smile and body|url=http://jada.ada.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/adaj/jada_middle_east_jan_feb_2011_dental_pt.ashx.pdf|journal=The Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=141|issue=12|page=1544|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2010.0115 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent demineralisation in the mouth, it is important for an individual to ensure they have a well-balanced diet, including foods containing calcium and foods that are low in acids and sugars. The individual should have a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes, seeds and nuts. Sugary snacks including lollies, fruit bars, muesli bars, biscuits, dried fruit, cordials, juices and soft drinks should be limited as they contribute to dental decay and dental erosion. Additionally, excessive starchy foods (such as bread, pasta, and crackers), fruits and milk products consumed frequently can cause the growth of dental plaque and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore healthy eating, healthy drinking and proper maintenance of oral hygiene is the best way to promote and maintain sound tooth structure for an individual.

===Xylitol===
[[Xylitol]] is a natural sweetener, also known as a sugar alcohol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Xylitol inhibits acid production by oral bacteria and promotes remineralisation of the teeth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It can be found in various products which include chewing gums and lozenges. Xylitol has been found to reduce mutans strepococci in plaque and saliva and reduce the binding of these to the acquired enamel pellicle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This in turn leads to less adherent plaque and a decrease in acid production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, chewing xylitol gum will stimulate increased salivary flow which in turn increases the amount of calcium in the saliva and enhances the oral clearance.

Additional saliva flow which includes chewing products such as gums that contain no fermentable carbohydrates can aid in the modulation of plaque pH. Sugar free xylitol is recommended for uses to prevent caries formation. Indeed, research has shown that the use of gum containing xylitol reduces plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation and enhances remineralisation process.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, S. &amp; Williamson, R. (2001). A review of saliva: Normal composition, flow, and function. The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, 85(2), 162-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spliff rolling machine papers.jpg|right|250px]]

A '''rolling machine''' is a machine that is designed to roll either [[tobacco]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], or other products such as [[synthetic cannabis]] into individual [[cigarette]]s or [[joint (cannabis)|joints]]. To roll a cigarette with cannabis, one must break up the smoking material, which can be done using a [[herb grinder|grinder]], as well as remove any stems so they won't puncture the paper. Rolling a cigarette with tobacco does not require prep work because the leaf is already shredded.

Once the material is ready, one opens up the rolling machine by sliding one of the rollers up and over; this exposes a channel where the material is loaded. Care must be taken to place a uniform amount of product in the channel or the burn rate will change as the cigarette or joint is smoked. When ready the roller is slid back into position and locks into place. The product is cradled and confined in a round space and gets rolled when the user begins to turn one of the rollers.

After a few turns, a single sheet of [[rolling paper]] is fed into the back of the channel with the "ungummed" side going in first. When rolled carefully the paper will make a complete revolution in the channel and will wrap around and under itself. At this point the user licks the gummed part of the rolling paper and continues to roll the rest of the rolling paper in. When the roller is moved out of position once again a perfectly rolled cigarette or joint is exposed.

Rolling machines come in different sizes to prepare different sized cigarettes or joints.  Generally, the smallest is a 70mm, followed by a 78mm, and the largest being a 100mm.

Another type of rolling machine, manufactured by at least one company, is less commonly seen, but easier to use than the dual-wheel variety. In a "rolling box", a belt of material is exposed by opening the rolling box. The lower portion of the belt can be expanded against a curved tray component, and the tray filled with the material that one wishes to roll a cigarette or joint out of. A piece of rolling paper is then placed behind the material, against the belt material, with the gummed side at the top and facing outwards. As the box is slowly closed, a bar lifts the belt material up against the material to be rolled, simultaneously pressing it against the rolling paper and packing it more tightly, and also causing the portion of the belt with the lower edge of the rolling paper to roll around outwards, forming the cigarette or joint. When the closing motion is complete, the finished cigarette or joint is ejected through a hole in the top of the box.

'''Sanjad-Sakati syndrome''' is a rare [[autosomal]] recessive genetic condition seen in offspring of [[Middle Eastern]] origin. It was first described in Saudi Arabia, but has been seen in Qatari, Kuwaiti, Omani and other children from the Middle East as well as elsewhere. The condition is caused by mutations or deletions in the [[TBCE]] gene of Chromosome No.1.

The condition is characterised by a triad of growth retardation and [[intellectual disability]], hypoparathyroidism and dysmorphism.

==Presentation==
Children with the Sanjad Sakati syndrome have a triad of:
a) [[hypoparathyroidism]] (with episodes of [[hypocalcemia]], hypocalcemic [[tetany]] and hypocalcemic [[seizures]].
b) severe [[intellectual disability]] and 
c) [[dysmorphism]].
Typically, children with this syndrome are born low-birth-weight due to intrauterine growth retardation. At birth, there is dysmorphism, which is later typified into the features described below. The child is stunted, often with demonstrable [[growth hormone deficiency]] and has moderate to severe intellectual disability, mainly as a consequence of repeated seizures brought on by the low blood ionic calcium levels. The immuno-reactive parathormone levels are low to undetectable, with low calcium and high phosphate levels in the blood.

''Dysmorphism'' is most evident on the face, with the following features:
* Long narrow face
* Deep-set, small eyes
* Beaked nose
* Large, floppy ears
* Small head ([[microcephaly]]) and
* Thin lips with a long philtrum.

===Other features===
Other features include:
* Stunting
* Small hands and feet with long, tapering fingers and [[clinodactyly]]
* Dental anomalies in the form of malalignment and [[malocclusion]]

In another study of six patients,&lt;ref&gt;Hershkovitz, E., Shalitin, S., Levy, J., Leiberman, E., Weinshtock, A., Varsano, I., Gorodischer, R. The new syndrome of congenital hypoparathyroidism associated with dysmorphism, growth retardation, and developmental delay: a report of six patients.&lt;/ref&gt; the patients were investigated further. They were found to have low levels of [[IGF-1]] and markedly retarded bone age.

==Genetics==

'''Taste Confusion Matrix (TCM)''' is a method in which many compounds are tested at the same time.  It is a study of human [[taste]] [[perception]].  It characterizes the quality of taste with identification patterns of some 10 stimuli which are analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Hettinger T. P., Gent J. F., Marks L. E., Frank M. E. (November 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">'''Thomas William "Tom" Ferguson, M.D.''' (July 8, 1943 &amp;ndash; April 14, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] medical doctor, educator, and author. He was an early advocate for patient empowerment, urging patients to educate themselves, to assume control of their own health care, and to use the Internet as a way of accomplishing those goals.&lt;ref name = "NYT obit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/24/us/24ferguson.html?_r=1 New York Times, April 24, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life, education, and career==
He was born in [[Ross, California]] and grew up in [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]. He eventually settled in [[Austin, Texas]], hometown of his wife Meredith Mitchell Dreiss.
He obtained a bachelor's degree from  [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and a master's degree in creative writing from [[San Francisco State University]]. He then went to [[Yale University School of Medicine]], graduating in 1977 with an M.D. degree. However, he never had a medical practice.&lt;ref name = "medscape"&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/531595 Medscape, May 11, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he became a prolific writer about patients as medical consumers and about the [[doctor-patient relationship]], "arguing that informed self-care was a jumping-off point for better health and made for a richer, fairer, if nontraditional, partnership between physicians and their patients."&lt;ref name = "medscape" /&gt; He studied and wrote about the empowered medical consumer beginning in 1975, and about online health resources for consumers beginning in 1987. "He urged patients to educate themselves and share knowledge with one another, and urged doctors to collaborate with patients rather than command them. Predicting the Internet's potential for disseminating medical information long before it became a familiar conduit, he was an early proponent of its use, terming laymen who did so '[[E-Patient]]s'."&lt;ref name = "NYT obit" /&gt; He researched and promoted the popular use of electronic resources including the Internet to gather information and cope with medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1182328 | pmid=16060721 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020206 | volume=2 | title=What I've learned from E-patients | date=August 2005 | journal=PLoS Med. | page=e206 | last1 = Hoch | first1 = D | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fergusonreport.com/articles/fr039905.htm The Ferguson Report, March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 he organized the world's first conference devoted to computer systems designed for medical consumers.

He exemplified his own philosophy when he was diagnosed with [[multiple myeloma]] in 1991. "He relentlessly pursued strategies for both self-care and the newest research and experimental practices for controlling this aggressive cancer ... Between relapses and debilitating treatments, he led a migration of medical consumer information to the internet, lectured widely on the emerging field of 'health informatics,' and earned a global reputation as a true innovator and pioneer in the field."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/531595 Austin-American Statesman, quoted at Medscape, May 11, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; He died April 14, 2006, while undergoing treatment in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name = "NYT obit" /&gt;

An '''impacted tooth''' is one that fails to [[tooth eruption|erupt]] into the dental arch within the expected [[Human tooth development#Tooth eruption|developmental window]].
Because impacted teeth do not erupt, they are retained throughout the individual's lifetime unless [[tooth extraction|extracted]] or exposed surgically. Teeth may become impacted because of adjacent teeth, dense overlying bone, excessive [[soft tissue]] or a genetic abnormality. Most often, the cause of impaction is inadequate arch length and space in which to erupt. That is the total length of the alveolar arch is smaller than the tooth arch (the combined mesiodistal width of each tooth). The [[wisdom teeth]] (third molars) [[impacted wisdom teeth|are frequently impacted]] because they are the last teeth to erupt in the oral cavity. [[Mandible|Mandibular]] third molars are more commonly impacted than their maxillary counterparts. 

As a general rule, all impacted teeth must be removed&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Peterson's Principles of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|author1=Miloro, M.|author2=Ghali, G.E.|author3=Larsen, P.|author4=Waite, P.|date=2004|volume=1|publisher=B C Decker|isbn=9781550092349|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Jf9WZltV1BAC|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; except, in certain cases, canine teeth: canines may just remain buried and give no further problems, thus not requiring surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="cuh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuh.org.uk/addenbrookes-hospital/services/oral-and-maxillofacial-surgery-and-orthodontics/impacted-teeth-including-surgery-for-canine-teeth|title=Impacted teeth including surgery for canine teeth &amp;#124; Cambridge University Hospitals|publisher=cuh.org.uk|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, removal of an asymptomatic impacted tooth isn't a medical consensus: watchful monitoring may be a more prudent and cost-effective strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=27578151 |title=Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth |author=Mettes, Theodorus Dirk G. et al |editor=Cochrane Oral Health Group |date=2016-08-31 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003879.pub4 |place=Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A.

==Classification==

Classifications enable the [[oral surgeon]] to determine the difficulty in removal of the impacted tooth.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand|publisher=Index Copernicus|issn=0125-2208|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xqw5_Uv9EOcC&amp;pg=PT152|accessdate=2015-08-22|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary factor determining the difficulty is accessibility, which is determined by adjacent teeth or other structures that impair access or delivery pathway. The majority of classification schemes are based on analysis on a [[dental radiograph|radiograph]]. The most frequently considered factors are discussed below.

===Angulation of tooth===
[[Image:Milk-tooth and impacted inverted 2nd premolar.jpg|thumb|Very rare case of vertical premolar impaction: the permanent second premolar on the lower right side of the mouth is impacted, inverted and pierces the mandibular bone. Notice that the deciduous second molar is also present, which is uncommon because the patient is a 37 year old man.]]
Most commonly used classification system with respect to treatment planning. Depending on the angulation the tooth might be classified as:
* Mesioangular
* Horizontal
* Vertical
* Distoangular
* Palatal
* Buccal
* Lingual

===Relationship of tooth to anterior border of ramus===

This type of classification is based on the amount of impacted tooth that is covered with the [[human mandible|mandibular ramus]]. It is known as the Pell and Gregory classification, classes 1, 2, and 3.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oral Surgery|author=Fragiskos, F.D.|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540499756|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wJHV_TqpL_sC&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage|page=126|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship of tooth to occlusal plane===

The depth of the impacted tooth compared with the adjacent second molar gives the basis for this type of classification. This was also given by Pell and Gregory and is called as Pell and Gregory A, B and C classification.

==Complications==

Erupted teeth that are adjacent to impacted teeth are predisposed to [[periodontal disease]]. Since the most difficult tooth surface to be cleaned is the distal surface of the last tooth, in the presence of an impacted tooth there is always [[gingivitis|gingival inflammation]] around the second molar that is invariably present. Even this minor amount of inflammation can provide [[bacteria]] access to a larger portion of the root surface that results in early formation of [[periodontitis]] compromising the tooth.
Even in situations in which no obvious communication exists between the mouth and the impacted third molar there may be enough communication to initiate [[dental caries]] (tooth decay).

===Pericoronitis===
{{main|pericoronitis}}
Pericoronitis is an infection of the soft tissue that covers the crown of an impacted tooth and is usually caused by the normal [[human mouth|oral]] [[microbiota]]. For most people there exists a balance between the host defenses and the oral micriobiota but if the host defenses are compromised like during minor illness such as [[influenza]] or an [[upper respiratory tract infection]], pericoronitis results. Another common cause is entrapment of food beneath the gum flap (also called an operculum). Pericoronitis can present as a mild infection or severe infection. In its mildest form it is just a localized tissue swelling and soreness whereas in severe forms the swelling is slightly larger even sometimes creating [[trismus]] (difficulty opening the mouth).

Occasionally, an impacted tooth causes sufficient pressure on the roots of adjacent teeth causing it to [[Tooth resorption|resorb]].

An impacted tooth occupies space that is usually filled with bone. This weakens that area of bone and renders the jaw more susceptible to [[mandibular fracture|fracture]].

When impacted teeth are retained completely within the [[alveolar process]], the associated follicular sac is also retained along with it. Though in most persons the [[dental follicle]] maintains its original size sometimes it may undergo [[cyst]]ic degeneration and become a [[dentigerous cyst]] or a [[keratocyst]].

==Symptoms==

Most commonly the individual complains of food getting lodged beneath the gums and a soreness that is usually confused with throat infections. In slightly milder forms a swelling is visible and mouth opening becomes difficult in severe cases. Pain is invariably present.

==Management==
All impacted teeth, unless otherwise contraindicated, are considered for surgical removal. Thus, dental extractions will often take place. The type of extraction (simple or surgical) often depends on the location of the teeth.

In some cases, for aesthetic purposes, a surgeon may wish to expose the canine. This may be achieved through open or closed exposure. Studies show no advantage of one method over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkin N, Benson PE, Thind B, Shah A, Khalil I, Ghafoor S.|first=|date=August 2017|title=Open versus closed surgical exposure of canine teeth that are displaced in the roof of the mouth.|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], '''trap-lining''' or '''traplining''' is a feeding strategy in which an individual visits food sources on a regular, repeatable sequence, much as [[Animal trapping|trappers]] check their lines of traps.&lt;ref name="Ref One" /&gt; Traplining is usually seen in species foraging for floral resources.&lt;ref name="ref 19"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohashi|first1=Kazuharu|last2=Thomson|first2=James D.|title=Trapline foraging by bumblebees: VI.

Trap-lining has been described in several taxa (sing. [[taxon]]), including [[bees]], [[butterflies]], [[tamarins]], [[bats]], [[rats]], and [[hummingbirds]] and tropical [[Frugivory|fruit-eating]] mammals such as [[opossums]], [[Capuchin monkey|capuchins]] and [[kinkajous]].&lt;ref name="Ref One"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sahel|first1=Nehal|last2=Chittka|first2=Lars|title=Traplining in bumblebees ( Bombus impatiens ): a foraging strategy's ontogeny and the importance of spatial reference memory in short-range foraging|journal=Oecologia|date=2007|volume=151|pages=719–730|doi=10.1007/s00442-006-0607-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kays|first1=Roland|last2=Rodriguez|first2=M.

( Ochroma pyramidale ) in panama.|journal=Mesoamericana|date=2012|volume=16|issue=3|pages=56–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traplining is used to term the method in which bumblebees and hummingbirds go about collecting nectar, and consequently, [[pollination|pollinating]] each plant they visit. The term "traplining" was originally coined by [[Daniel Janzen]],&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=James D.|last2=Slatkin|first2=Montgomery|last3=Thomson|first3=Barbara A.|title=Trapline foraging by bumble bees: II .

==Behavioral response ==
In the instance of hummingbirds and bumblebees, traplining is an evolutionary response to the allocation of resources between species.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Temeles|first1=Ethan, J.|last2=Shaw|first2=Kathryn C.|last3=Kudla|first3=Alexei U.|last4=Sander|first4=Sarah E.|title=Traplining by purple-throated carib hummingbirds: behavioral responses to [[competition]] and nectar availability|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=2006|volume=61|issue=2|pages=163–172|doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0247-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, individual hummingbirds form their own specific routes in order to minimize competition and maximize nutrient availability. Some hummingbird species are territorial (e.g. [[rufous hummingbird]], ''Selasphorus rufus'',) and defend a specific territory, while others are trapliners (i.e. [[Long-billed hermit]], ''Phaethornis longirostris'') and constantly check different locations for food. Because of this, territorial hummingbirds will be more robust, while traplining hummingbirds have adaptations such as longer wings for more efficient flying.&lt;ref name="Ref 14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinsinger|first1=Peter|last2=Chaplin|first2=Susan Budd|title=On the relationship between wing disc loading and foraging strategy in hummingbirds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1975|volume=109|issue=996|pages=217–224|doi=10.1086/282988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traplining hummingbirds will move from source to source, obtaining nectar from each. Over time, one hummingbird will be the primary visitor to a particular source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Frank B.|title=Trapline Foraging by Hermit Hummingbirds: Competition for an Undefended, Renewable Resource|journal=Ecology|date=1988|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1933–1942|doi=10.2307/1941170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of bumblebees, when competitors are removed, there is an influx to the removal area and less time is spent traplining over long distances. This demonstrates the ability to behaviorally adapt based on surrounding competition.&lt;ref name="Ref 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=J.D.|last2=Peterson|first2=S.C.|last3=Harder|first3=L. D.|title=Response of Traplining Bumble Bees to Competition Experiments: Shifts in Feeding Location and Efficiency|journal=Oecologia|date=1987|volume=71|issue=2|pages=295–300|doi=10.1007/bf00377298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, bumblebees use traplining to distinguish between high nectar-producing flowers and low-nectar producing flowers by consistently recognizing and visiting those that produce higher levels.&lt;ref name="Ref 8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saleh|first1=Nehal|last2=Chittka|first2=Lars|title=Traplining in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens): a foraging strategy's ontogeny and the importance of spatial reference memory in short-range foraging|journal=Oecologia|date=2007|volume=151|issue=4|pages=719–730|doi=10.1007/s00442-006-0607-9|pmid=17136553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of bees, such as with euglossine bees (i.e. ''[[Euglossa imperialis]]'') use traplining to forage efficiently by flying rapidly from one precise flowering plant to the next in a set circuit, even ignoring newly blooming plants which are adjacent, but outside, of its daily route. By doing so, these euglossine bees significantly reduce the amount of time and energy spent searching for nectar each day.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, James D., et al. "Food-foraging behavior of male Euglossini (Hymenoptera: Apidae): vagabonds or trapliners?." Biotropica (1982): 241-248.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is seen that traplining species have higher nutritional rewards than non-traplining species.&lt;ref name="ref 20"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohashi|first1=Kazuharu|last2=Thomson|first2=James D.|title=Efficient harvesting of renewing resources|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=592–605|doi=10.1093/beheco/ari031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy conservation==
Traplining hummingbirds are known to be active proportionally to nectar production in flowers, decreasing throughout the day. Therefore, traplining hummingbirds can spend less time foraging, and obtain their energy intake from a few number of flowers.&lt;ref name="Ref 6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glass|first1=C.L.|last2=Garrison|first2=J.S.E.|title=Energy regulation by traplining hummingbirds|journal=Functional Ecology|date=1999|volume=13|issue=4|pages=483–492|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00335.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spending less time searching for food means less energy spent flying and searching. Traplining bumblebees prioritize their routes based on travel distance and reward quantity.&lt;ref name="Ref 7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lihoreau|first1=Mathieu|last2=Chittka|first2=Lars|last3=Raine|first3=Nigel, E.|title=Trade‐off between Travel Distance and Prioritization of high‐reward Sites in Traplining Bumblebees|journal=Functional Ecology|date=2011|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1284–1292|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01881.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen that the total distance of the trapline is related to the abundance of the reward (nectar) in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=Jennifer|last2=Glass|first2=Clifton D.|title=Response of a traplining hummingbird to changes in nectar availability|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=1999|volume=10|issue=6|pages=714–725|doi=10.1093/beheco/10.6.714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial cognition and memory==
Traplining can also be an indication of the levels of [[spatial cognition]] of species that use the technique. For example, traplining in bumblebees is an indication that bumblebees have spatial reference memory, or [[spatial memory]], that is used to create specific routes in short term foraging.&lt;ref name="Ref 8" /&gt; The ability to remember specific routes long-term cuts down foraging and flying time, consequently conserving energy. This theory has been tested, showing that bumblebees can remember the shortest route to the reward, even when the original path has been changed or obstructed.&lt;ref name="ref 15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=J.D.|title=Traplining foraging by bumblebees I. Persistence of flight path geometry|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=1996|volume=7|pages=158–164|doi=10.1093/beheco/7.2.158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, bees cut down the amount of time spent revisiting sites with little or no nutritive reward.&lt;ref name="Ref 8" /&gt; Bees with access to only [[short-term memory]] forage inefficiently.&lt;ref name="Ref 8" /&gt;

==Advantages ==
One of the main advantages of traplining is that the route can be taught to other members of the population quickly or over a period of hours, leading all members to a reliable food source. When the group works together on finding a particular source of food they can quickly establish where it is and get the route information transferred to all the individuals in the population. This ensures that the entire community is able to quickly find and consume the nutrients that are needed.

Traplining helps foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way. For example, nectar in a plant is slowly replaced over time, while acorns only occur once a year.&lt;ref name="Ref 9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kato|first1=Makoto|title=Ecology of traplining bees and understory pollinators|journal=Ecological Studies|date=2005|volume=174|pages=128–133|doi=10.1007/0-387-27161-9_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traplining can help plant diversity and evolution by keeping pollen with different genetics flowing from plant to plant. It is mostly pollinators that use traplining as a way to ensure they always know where the food sources they are looking for are. This means that organisms like bumblebees and hummingbirds can transfer pollen anywhere from the starting point of the route to the final food source along the path. Since the path is always the same, it greatly reduces the risk of [[self-pollination]] (iterogamy) because the pollinator won’t return to the same flower on that particular foraging session.&lt;ref name="Ref 9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolowski|first1=Marina|last2=Saad|first2=Carolina|last3=Ashman|first3=Tia-Lynn|last4=Freitas|first4=Leandro|title=Predominance of self-compatibility in hummingbird-pollinated plants in the Neotropics|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=2013|volume=100|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1007/s00114-012-0995-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, plant species that are visited by trapliners have increased fitness and evolutionary advantages.&lt;ref name="ref 18"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohashi|first1=Kazuharu|last2=Leslie|first2=Alison|last3=Thomson|first3=James D.|title=Trapline foraging by pollinators: its ontogeny, economics, and possible consequences for plants.|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2009|volume=103|issue=9|pages=1365–1367|doi=10.1093/aob/mcp088|pmc=2701764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this mutualistic relationship between traplining hummingbirds and plants, traplining hummingbirds have been referred to as "legitimate pollinators", while territorial hummingbirds have been referred to as "nectar thieves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=David A.|title=Trapliners in the Trees: Hummingbird Pollination of Erythrina Sect. Erythrina (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae)|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|date=1987|volume=74|issue=1|pages=27–41|doi=10.2307/2399259}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an organism that traplines learns where a food source is once, they can always return to that food source because they can remember minute details about the location of the source. This allows them to adapt quickly if one of the major sources suddenly becomes scarce or destroyed.&lt;ref name="ref 10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lihoreau|first1=Mathieu|last2=Chittka|first2=Lars|last3=Raine|first3=Nigel E.|title=Trade-off between travel distance and prioritization of high-reward sites in trapiling bumblebees|journal=Functional Ecology|date=2011|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1284–1292|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01881.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Serious obstacles, such as the arrangement of plant life, can hamper traplining. If the route zig zags through the understory of the tropical rainforest, some of the organisms using the route can get lost because of very subtle changes,&lt;ref name="Ref 9" /&gt; such as a [[treefall gap]] or heavy rainfall. This could cause an individual to be separated from the entire group if it isn’t able to find the path back to the original route. Some food sources can be overlooked because the traplining route in use does not lead the organisms to the area that these resources are in.

Since the route is very specific, the organisms following it may also miss out on opportunities to come in contact with potential mates. Male bumblebees going directly to the source of food have been observed to pass up on female bumblebees as potential mates that are along the same path, preferring to continue foraging and bring food back to the hive.&lt;ref name="ref 10" /&gt; This can take away from species diversification and could possibly delete some traits in the [[gene pool]] that are useful.

==Research==

Observing traplining in the natural world has proven to be very difficult{{According to whom|date=December 2014}} and little is known about how and why species trapline, but the study of traplining in the natural environment does take place. In one particular study, individual bees trained on five artificial flowers of equal reward were observed traplining between those five flowers. When a new flower of higher reward gets included in the group, the bees subsequently adjust their trapline to include the higher reward flower. Under natural conditions they hypothesized that it would likely be beneficial for bees to prioritize higher reward flowers to either beat out competition or conserve energy.

In other field experiments, ecologists created a "competition vacuum" to observe whether or not bumblebees adjusted their feeding routes based on intense direct competition between other bumblebees. This study showed that bees in areas of higher competition are more productive than the control bees. Bumblebees opportunistically adjust their use of traplining routes in response to activity of other competing bees.&lt;ref name="Ref 5"/&gt; Another effective way to study the behavior of traplining species is via computer simulation and indoor flight cage experiments. Simulation models can be made to show the linkage between pollinator movement and pollen flow. This model considers how service by the pollinators with different foraging patterns would affect the flow of pollen.

Indoor flight cage experiments allow for easier determination between test subjects and easier observation of behavior and patterns. Bees in small study environments seem to demonstrate less traplining tendencies than bees that were studied in environments that stretched over several hectares. A larger working area increases the need for traplining techniques to further conserve energy and maximize nutrient intake and that bees most often trapline due strictly to travel distance. The bees remember these complex flight paths by breaking them into small segments using vectors, landmarks and other environmental factors, each one pointing to the next destination.&lt;ref name="ref 13" /&gt;

Despite a long history of research on bee learning and navigation, most knowledge has been deduced from the behavior of foragers traveling between their nest and a single feeding location.&lt;ref name="Ref 14" /&gt; Only recently, studies of bumblebees foraging in arrays of artificial flowers fitted with automated tracking systems have started to describe the learning mechanisms behind complex route formation between multiple locations. The demonstration that all these observations can be accurately replicated by a single learning heuristic model holds considerable promises to further investigate these questions and fill a major gap in cognitive ecology.&lt;ref name="ref 13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohashi|first1=Kazuharu|last2=Leslie|first2=Alison|last3=Thomson|first3=James D.|title=Trapline foraging by bumblebees: V. effects of experience and priority on competitive performance|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2008|volume=19|issue=5|pages=936–948|doi=10.1093/beheco/arn048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very early onset [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (VEOIBD) is a type of [[Inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]] which starts in people younger than 6 years of age. According to age we can distiguish more specifically two categories within the VEOIBD diagnosis - naonatal [[Inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]] (patients younger than 1 month) and infantile [[Inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]] (patients younger than 2 years old).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlig|first=Holm H.|last2=Schwerd|first2=Tobias|last3=Koletzko|first3=Sibylle|last4=Shah|first4=Neil|last5=Kammermeier|first5=Jochen|last6=Elkadri|first6=Abdul|last7=Ouahed|first7=Jodie|last8=Wilson|first8=David C.|last9=Travis|first9=Simon P.|date=2014-11|title=The Diagnostic Approach to Monogenic Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2014.07.023|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=147|issue=5|pages=990–1007.e3|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2014.07.023|issn=0016-5085|pmc=5376484|pmid=25058236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
VEIOBD patients present with severe form of the disease that responds poorly to conventional therapies. The symptoms often include not only gastrointestinal tract, but also other tissues, such as [[pituitary gland]], [[spleen]], [[liver]], [[skin]], [[respiratory tract]] or [[blood]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, other types of [[primary immunodeficiency]] can often manifest with IBD-like symptoms, too. These include the [[IPEX syndrome]], [[Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome|Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]], [[XIAP syndrome]] or [[chronic granulomatous disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49215-5_5|title=Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease|last=Kelsen|first=Judith|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kathleen|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319492131|pages=55–67|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-49215-5_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
[[Inflammatory bowel disease|Inflammatory bowel diseases]] (IBDs), such as [[Crohn's disease|Crohn Disease]] (CD) or [[Ulcerative colitis|Ulcerative Colitis]] (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Up-to-date findings show that the pathogenesis is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. A considerable number of [[Monogenic (genetics)|monogenic]] disorders can be found especially among patients with VEOIBD. Causal mutations can be found in genes involved in epithelial barrier formation ([[COL7A1]], [[FERMT1]]), [[Innate immune system|innate]] ([[CYBB]], [[G6PC3]]), as well as the [[specific immune response]] and immune regulation ([[IL10 (gene)|IL10]], [[Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit|IL10RA]], [[FOXP3]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlig|first=Holm H.|date=2013-12-01|title=Monogenic diseases associated with intestinal inflammation: implications for the understanding of inflammatory bowel disease|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/62/12/1795|journal=Gut|language=en|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1795–1805|doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303956|issn=0017-5749|pmid=24203055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9897">'''Vivian Wilhelmina Myvett Seay''' (1881&amp;ndash;1971) was a [[British Honduras|British Honduran]] nurse, social reformer and activist. Seay, [[Afro-Belizean|Creole]] and of the middle class, attended the Anglican Church school and earned her teaching credentials in the pupil-teacher program. In 1920, she founded the country's [[Black Cross Nurses]] and led the group until she died, 51 years later. A social activist, the legalization of divorce in Belize is partially attributed to her work. In 1951, she was the only woman founder of the [[National Party (Belize)|National Party]] and she was the country's second woman citizen to be honored as [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]].

==Biography==
Vivian Wilhelmina Myvett  was born in British Honduras in 1881 to Francis and Margaret Myvett,{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=1}} a middle-class [[Belizean Creole|Creole]] family.{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=420}} She attended the Anglican Church school&lt;ref name=reporter.bz&gt;{{cite news|title=A Fashion Tribute to our Belizean History|url=http://www.reporter.bz/general/a-fashion-tribute-to-our-belizean-history/|accessdate=30 January 2016|publisher=''The Reporter Newspaper''|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at 16 entered the pupil-teaching system for a small salary.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=91}} which allowed her to further her education in exchange for teaching, which would lead to her certification as an educator four years later.{{sfn|Steward|Thomas|1996|p=40}} Earning her teacher certification, she taught in the Mayan village of [[Xcalak]], Mexico for nine years.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=91}} During this time, in 1905, she married Elizah Fitzgerald Seay.{{sfn| Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=1}} Returning to Belize by 1918, two years later she founded the British Honduran chapter of the [[Black Cross Nurses]] (BCN).{{sfn|Garvey|2011|pp=clxxvi, 178, 638}} She led a survey in 1920 on infant and maternal mortality which led to nursing training programs for which she actively recruited nurse trainees.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=1}} By 1923, there were twenty-four trained nurses which Seay assigned to various areas in [[Belize City|Belize Town]] as volunteers, since they were unpaid. The BCN members visited the homes of the poor in their assigned areas{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=94}} and provided proper parenting training, instruction on sanitation, midwifery services, and general welfare work.{{sfn |Macpherson|2003|pp=514-515}} In 1928, Seay and four other BCN members completed their formal [[midwife]] training at the Belize Hospital.{{sfn |Macpherson|2003|p=515}}

Seay led the BCN to assist victims of the [[1931 Belize hurricane]] and organized a program to provide meals for school children. In 1933, she campaigned for a male candidate, who was running for the Belize Town Board and was rewarded with her own appointment as its first female member.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=2}} One of her first recommendations was the creation of a registry for working women, so that they could enter their specialties, such as child care providers, cooks, maids, laundresses and would not have to go door to door in search of work. The idea failed, but she followed it up in 1934 with a proposal for the Palace Theatre to assist in an unemployment fund in conjunction with the BCN, which would provide groceries to needy families.{{sfn |Macpherson|2007|p=135}} For her loyalty and steadfastness in the midst of the anti-colonial labor unrest of 1934, Seay was awarded by Governor Alan Burns as a Member of the Order of the British Empire,{{sfn |Macpherson|2003|p=515}} becoming the country's second woman citizen to be honored when she accepted the presentation in 1935.&lt;ref name=reporter.bz /&gt; She argued in favor of divorce, as a countermeasure to adultery and illegitimacy, and when legalization occurred in 1935, Seay’s activism was credited in large part with its passage.{{sfn|Emery|2013|p=131}} That same year, when the Women’s League and Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA) women demanded suffrage,{{sfn |Macpherson|2007|p=138}} Seay spoke in opposition. While she was in favor of lowering women’s voting age to twenty-one,{{ sfn |Macpherson|2007|p=147}} she was not in favor of enfranchising poor women, who were in her view "the rowdy popular classes".{{ sfn |Macpherson|2007|p=148}} As a means of combating opposition from LUA and the Women’s League, Seay proposed that unemployed women be granted land, houses, and training to learn to farm and provide for their families, but the plan was rejected by the Colonial Office. {{sfn |Macpherson|2007|pp=168-169}}

In 1938, Seay and the BCN conducted a survey of working-class families which was presented to the West India Royal Commission.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=3}}  The report focused on male-led households, minimizing the situation of female-headed families, but confirmed poor housing conditions and diets, as well as high unemployment among “poor respectable families” in Belize Town.{{sfn |Macpherson|2007|p=169}} In 1941, Seay became a public employee, accepting the position as Inspector of Midwives and then seven years later became the first female British Honduran Justice of the Peace.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=3}}  Throughout the 1940s, Seay supported the anti-nationalist goals of the administration and then in 1951, {{sfn |Macpherson|2007|pp=175-176}} became the only woman founder of the National Party, which formed to contest severing ties with Britain.{{sfn|Macpherson|1998|p=31}} That same year, she accepted an appointment to the City Council when the governor dissolved the existing council. In 1952 Shea was a co-founder of the British Honduras Federation of Women, which began a project to provide an inexpensive daycare center for the children of working women.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=3}}  She remained active in opposition politics throughout the 1960s.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=4}}

Seay died in 1971 and was credited for her many years as a nurse, social reformer and activist.{{sfn|Mayr|2014|p=260}}{{sfn|Appelbaum|Macpherson|Rosemblatt|2003|p=127}} She was posthumously honored with a street which bears her name and a postage stamp bearing her likeness.{{sfn|Macpherson (Harvard) |2007|p=4}}

The '''water fluoridation controversy''' arises from political, moral, ethical, economic, and health considerations regarding the [[water fluoridation|fluoridation]] of public [[Water supply|water supplies]].

[[Public health]] authorities throughout the world find a [[medical consensus]] that [[fluoride therapy]] at appropriate levels is a safe and effective means to prevent [[dental caries]],&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt; whether by fluoridation of the public water supply or topical application strategies.&lt;ref name=NHMRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU2011/&gt; Proponents of water fluoridation see it as a question of public health policy and equate the issue to [[vaccination]] and [[food fortification]], claiming significant benefits to dental health and minimal risks.&lt;ref name=ethics&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]], looking at global public health, identifies fluoride as one of a few chemicals for which the contribution from drinking-water to overall intake is an important factor in preventing disease. This is because there is clear evidence that optimal concentrations of fluoride provide protection against cavities, both in children and in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/oralhealth/en/index2.html |title=Water fluoridation |work=World Water Day 2001: Oral health |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030918/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/oralhealth/en/index2.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all |quote="There are few chemicals for which the contribution from drinking-water to overall intake is an important factor in preventing disease.

===Minority scientific view===
The scientists or doctors who oppose water fluoridation argue that it has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is pharmacologically obsolete.&lt;ref name=Thiessen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hileman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; [[Arvid Carlsson]] has argued that fluoridation violates modern [[Clinical pharmacology|pharmacological principles]] and doesn't take into account individual variations in response, which can be considerable even when the dosage is fixed.&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bryson | first = Christopher | title = The fluoride deception (page 240) | publisher = Seven Stories Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781609800086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Proponents and opponents have been both criticized for overstating the benefits or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively.&lt;ref name="ChengChalmers2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=yorkcrd/&gt; Systematic reviews have cited the lack of high-quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled.&lt;ref name=Scher2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=yorkcrd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ih2015/&gt;  A 2007 [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking.&lt;ref name=nuffield/&gt; Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well.&lt;ref name="Book Reviews 2011"/&gt; According to a 2013 [[Congressional Research Service]] report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; John Doull, chairman of the 2006 [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding the source of the controversy: "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says this is one of the 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [fluoridation] has been going on. I think that’s why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began. In the face of ignorance, controversy is rampant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett-Rose|first1=Rita|title=Compulsory Water Fluoridation: Justifiable Public Health Benefit or Human Experimental Research Without Informed Consent?|journal=William &amp; Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review|date=December 2014|volume= 39|issue= 1|page=225|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol39/iss1/7/|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fagin|first1=Dan|title=Second Thoughts about Fluoride|journal=Scientific American|date=1 January 2008|volume=298|issue=1|pages=74–81|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0108-74|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v298/n1/full/scientificamerican0108-74.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|language=en|pmid=18225698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluoride]] can be present naturally in water at concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have [[Fluoride poisoning#Chronic toxicity|several long-term adverse effects]], including severe dental fluorosis, [[skeletal fluorosis]], and weakened bones.&lt;ref name="Hhe"&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Human health effects |title=Fluoride in Drinking-water |author=Fawell J, Bailey K, Chilton J, Dahi E, Fewtrell L, Magara Y |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=92-4-156319-2 |year=2006 |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf |format=PDF |pages=29–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the World Health Organization recommended a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L as a level at which fluorosis should be minimal, reaffirming it in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Guidelines and standards |title=Fluoride in Drinking-water |author=Fawell J, Bailey K, Chilton J, Dahi E, Fewtrell L, Magara Y |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=92-4-156319-2 |year=2006 |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf |format=PDF |pages=37–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute [[fluoride poisoning]], with symptoms that include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]]. Three such outbreaks were reported in the U.S. between 1991 and 1998, caused by fluoride concentrations as high as 220&amp;nbsp;mg/L; in the 1992 Alaska outbreak, 262 people became ill and one person died.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Balbus JM, Lang ME |title=Is the water safe for my baby? |journal=Pediatr.

Like other common water additives such as [[water chlorination|chlorine]], hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride decrease pH and cause a small increase of [[corrosivity]], but this problem is easily addressed by increasing the pH.&lt;ref name=Pollick/&gt; Although it has been hypothesized that hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride might increase human [[lead]] uptake from water, a 2006 statistical analysis did not support concerns that these chemicals cause higher blood lead concentrations in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Macek MD, Matte TD, Sinks T, Malvitz DM |title=Blood lead concentrations in children and method of water fluoridation in the United States, 1988–1994 |journal=Environ.

A 2000 UK [[systematic review]] (York) found that water fluoridation was [[Association (statistics)|associated]] with a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, [[Tooth loss|missing]], and [[Dental restoration|filled]] [[primary teeth]] (average decreases was 2.25&amp;nbsp;teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce [[observer bias]], control for [[confounding factor]]s, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.&lt;ref name=YorkReview2000/&gt;  A 2002 systematic review found strong evidence that water fluoridation is effective at reducing overall tooth decay in communities.&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Truman BI, Gooch BF, Sulemana I ''et al.'' |title=Reviews of evidence on interventions to prevent dental caries, oral and pharyngeal cancers, and sports-related craniofacial injuries |journal=Am.

Fluoride may also prevent cavities in adults of all ages. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by CDC researchers found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults, about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average).&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Griffin SO, Regnier E, Griffin PM, Huntley V |title=Effectiveness of fluoride in preventing caries in adults |journal=J.

Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt; For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped. Fluoridation may be useful in the U.S. because unlike most European countries, the U.S. does not have school-based dental care, many children do not visit a dentist regularly, and for many U.S. children water fluoridation is the prime source of exposure to fluoride.&lt;ref name=Burt&gt;{{vcite book |author=Burt BA, Tomar SL |chapter=Changing the face of America: water fluoridation and oral health |pages=307–22 |title=Silent Victories: The History and Practice of Public Health in Twentieth-century America |editor=Ward JW, Warren C |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-19-515069-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of water fluoridation can vary according to circumstances such as whether preventive dental care is free to all children.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hausen HW |title=Fluoridation, fractures, and teeth |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7265 |pages=844–5 |year=2000 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7265.844 |pmid=11021844 |pmc=1118662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Water fluoridation pits the common good against individual rights.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement is not self-evident and requires justification|date=July 2018}} Some say the common good overrides individual rights, and equate it to [[vaccination]] and [[food fortification]].&lt;ref name=ethics/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross2003/&gt; Others say that individual rights override the common good, and say that individuals have no choice in the water that they drink, unless they drink more expensive bottled water,&lt;ref name=Coggon/&gt; and some argue unequivocally that it does not stand up to scrutiny relative to the Nuremberg Code and other codes of medical ethics.&lt;ref name=Cross2003/&gt;

Those who emphasize the public good emphasize the [[Water fluoridation controversy#Medical consensus|medical consensus]] that appropriate levels of water fluoridation are safe and effective to prevent cavities and see it as a [[public health]] intervention, replicating the benefits of naturally fluoridated water, which can free people from the misery and expense of tooth decay and [[toothache]], with the greatest benefit accruing to those least able to help themselves. This perspective suggests it would be unethical to withhold such treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=The ethics of water fluoridation |chapterurl=http://www.bfsweb.org/onemillion/12%20One%20in%20a%20Million%20-%20The%20Ethics%20of%20Water%20Fluoridation.pdf |url=http://bfsweb.org/onemillion/onemillion.htm |title=One in a Million: The facts about water fluoridation |edition=3rd |year=2012 |author=The British Fluoridation Society; The UK Public Health Association; The British Dental Association; The Faculty of Public Health |isbn=0-9547684-0-X |pages=88–92 |publisher=British Fluoridation Society |location=Manchester |chapterformat=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122032013/http://www.bfsweb.org/onemillion/onemillion.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all |accessdate=21 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''50 Health Scares That Fizzled'', [[Joan Callahan]] writes that, "For lower-income people with no insurance, fluoridated water (like enriched flour and fortified milk) looks more like a free preventative health measure that a few elitists are trying to take away."&lt;ref&gt;"50 Health Scares That Fizzled" by Joan R.

A 2007 [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] report reached a conclusion mainly on three points, stating that :
* The balance of benefit to risk ratio -  is unclear due to the lack of good evidence for or against water fluoridation.
* Alternatives to the practice exist - topical fluoride therapy (toothbrushing etc.)
* The role of consent- It gets priority when there are potential harms.
The report therefore concluded that local and regional democratic procedures are the most appropriate way to decide whether to fluoridate.&lt;ref name=nuffield&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Calman K |title=Beyond the 'nanny state': stewardship and public health |journal=Public Health |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=e6–e10 |year=2009 |pmid=19135693 |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2008.10.025 |laysummary=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/One_page_summary_public_health.pdf |laysource=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |laydate=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nuffieldfull&gt;{{cite book|title=Public health : ethical issues (Chapter 7 - Fluoridation of water)|date=2007|publisher=[[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-904384-17-5|url=http://nuffieldbioethics.org/report/public-health-2/water-fluoridation/|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Water Fluoridation in the United States|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/24/13/36/community-water-fluoridation-in-the-united-states|website=www.apha.org|publisher=American Public Health Association|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Yindi|last2=Foster Page|first2=Lyndie A.|last3=McMillan|first3=John|last4=Lyons|first4=Karl|last5=Broadbent|first5=Jonathan|last6=Morgaine|first6=Kate C.|title=Is New Zealand water fluoridation justified?|journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal|date=28 November 2014|volume=127|issue=1406|pages=80–86|pmid=25447252|issn=1175-8716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition groups and campaigns==
The controversy is propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; including researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners such as [[chiropractors]], health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly [[Christian Scientists]] in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists.&lt;ref name=Reilly/&gt; Organized political opposition has come from [[libertarians]],&lt;ref name=Dehnbase/&gt; the [[John Birch Society]],&lt;ref name="Freeze"/&gt; and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Greenwars/&gt;&lt;ref name=GreenUK2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Freeze RA, Lehr JH |title=The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America's Longest-Running Political Melodrama |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |chapter=Fluoride and health |pages=219–54 |isbn=0-470-44833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition campaigns involve newspaper articles, talk radio, and public forums. Media reporters are often poorly equipped to explain the scientific issues, and are motivated to present controversy regardless of the underlying scientific merits. Websites, which are increasingly used by the public for health information, contain a wide range of material about fluoridation ranging from factual to fraudulent, with a disproportionate percentage opposed to fluoridation. Antifluoridationist literature links fluoride exposure to a wide variety of effects, including [[AIDS]], [[allergy]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], [[cancer]], and low [[IQ]], along with diseases of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[kidney]], [[pineal gland]], and [[thyroid]].&lt;ref name=Armfield&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Armfield JM |title=When public action undermines public health: a critical examination of antifluoridationist literature |journal=Aust.

==Public opinion==
Many people do not know that fluoridation is meant to prevent tooth decay, or that natural or bottled water can contain fluoride. As fluoridation does not appear to be an important issue for the general public in the U.S., the debate may reflect an argument between two relatively small [[Lobbying|lobbies]] for and against fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Griffin-opinions/&gt;

A survey of Australians in 2009 found that 70% supported and 15% opposed fluoridation. Those opposed were much more likely to score higher on [[outrage factor]]s such as "unclear benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Armfield JM, Akers HF |title=Risk perception and water fluoridation support and opposition in Australia |journal=J.

A study of focus groups from 16 European countries in 2003 found that fluoridation was opposed by a majority of focus group members in most of the countries, including France, Germany, and the UK.&lt;ref name=Griffin-opinions&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Griffin M, Shickle D, Moran N |title=European citizens' opinions on water fluoridation |journal=Community Dent.

A survey in [[Sheffield]], UK performed in 1999 found that while a 62% majority favored water fluoridation in the city, the 31% who were opposed [[Willingness to pay|expressed their preference]] with greater intensity than supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Dixon S, Shackley P |title=Estimating the benefits of community water fluoridation using the willingness-to-pay technique: results of a pilot study |journal=Community Dent.

Every year in the U.S., pro- and anti-fluoridationists face off in [[referenda]] or other public decision-making processes: in most of them, fluoridation is rejected.&lt;ref name=Reilly/&gt;

Despite support by public health organizations and authorities, the practice is controversial as a public health measure; some countries and communities have discontinued it, while others have expanded it.&lt;ref name=Scher2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

In the U.S., rejection in state and local communities is more likely when the decision is made by a public referendum; in Europe, most decisions against fluoridation have been made administratively.&lt;ref name=Martin1989&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Martin B |year=1989 |title=The sociology of the fluoridation controversy: a reexamination |journal=Sociol.

In the United Kingdom a [[strategic health authority]] can direct a water company to fluoridate the water supply in an area if it is technically possible. The strategic health authority must consult with the local community and businesses in the affected area. The water company will act as a contractor in any new schemes and cannot refuse to fluoridate the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedutilities.com/About-your-water.aspx |title=About your water |publisher=United Utilities }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas with complex water sources, water fluoridation is more difficult and more costly. Alternative fluoridation methods have been proposed, and implemented in some parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is currently assessing the effects of fluoridated toothpaste, milk fluoridation and salt fluoridation in Africa, Asia, and Europe.  The WHO supports fluoridation of water in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/oral_health/media/en/orh_report03_en.pdf |title=World Oral Health Report |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=4 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other countries, [[sodium fluoride]] is added to table salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/environmental_risks/docs/scher_o_122.pdf }}, citing {{cite journal |author=Götzfried, Franz |journal=Schweizer Monatsschrift für Zahnmedizin |title=Production of fluoridated salt |year=2006 |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=367–370 |pmid=16708522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water.

== History ==
{{Main|History of water fluoridation}}

Fluoridation began during a time of great optimism and faith in science and experts (the 1950s and 1960s), but even then, the public frequently objected. Opponents drew on distrust of experts and unease about medicine and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Carstairs C, Elder R |title=Expertise, health, and popular opinion: debating water fluoridation, 1945–80 |journal=Can. Hist. Rev. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=345–71 |year=2008 |doi=10.3138/chr.89.3.345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversies include disputes over fluoridation's benefits and the strength of the evidence basis for these benefits, the difficulty of identifying harms, legal issues over whether water fluoride is a medicine, and the ethics of mass intervention.&lt;ref name="ChengChalmers2007"/&gt;

The first large fluoridation controversy occurred in Wisconsin in 1950. Fluoridation opponents questioned the ethics, safety, and efficacy of fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musto RJ |title=Fluoridation: why is it not more widely adopted? |journal=CMAJ |volume=137 |issue=8 |pages=705–8 |date=October 1987 |pmid=3651941 |pmc=1267306 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand was the second country to fluoridate, and similar controversies arose there.&lt;ref name=Wrapson&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40111610 | year = 2005 | title = Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies in New Zealand:'Magic Bullet,'Rat Poison, or Communist Plot? | journal = Health and History | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 17–29 | url = http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/7.2/wrapson.html | author = Wrapson J | jstor = 40111610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears about fluoride were likely exacerbated by the reputation of fluoride compounds as insect poisons and by early literature which tended to use terms such as "toxic" and "low grade chronic [[fluoride poisoning]]" to describe mottling from consumption of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/L of fluoride prior to tooth eruption, a level of consumption not expected to occur under controlled fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richmond VL |title=Thirty years of fluoridation: a review |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=129–38 |date=January 1985 |pmid=3917599 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3917599|doi=10.1093/ajcn/41.1.129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When voted upon, the outcomes tend to be negative, and thus fluoridation has had a history of gaining through administrative orders in North America.&lt;ref name=Musto/&gt;

[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] involving fluoridation are common, and include claims that fluoridation was motivated by protecting the U.S. atomic bomb program from litigation, that (as famously parodied in the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]],'' where a deranged U.S. Army general claimed that it would "sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids") it is part of a [[Communist]] or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] plot to take over the world, that it was pioneered by a German chemical company to make people submissive to those in power, that behind the scenes it is promoted by the sugary food or phosphate fertilizer or aluminium industries, or that it is a smokescreen to cover failure to provide dental care to the poor.&lt;ref name=Armfield/&gt; One such theory is that fluoridation was a [[public-relations]] ruse sponsored by fluoride polluters such as the aluminium maker [[Alcoa]] and the [[Manhattan Project]], with conspirators that included industrialist [[Andrew Mellon]] and the [[Mellon Institute]]'s researcher Gerald J. Cox, the Kettering Laboratory of the [[University of Cincinnati]], the [[Federal Security Agency]]'s administrator Oscar R.

Outside North America, water fluoridation was adopted in some European countries, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Denmark and Sweden banned fluoridation when government panels found insufficient evidence of safety, and the Netherlands banned water fluoridation when "a group of medical practitioners presented evidence" that it caused negative effects in a percentage of the population.

=== Communist conspiracy theory (1940s–1960s) ===

Water fluoridation has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. During the "[[Red Scare]]" in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, activists on the far right of American politics routinely asserted that fluoridation was part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. These opponents believed it was "another aspect of President [[Harry Truman|Truman]]'s drive to socialize medicine."&lt;ref name="Henigbook1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henig|first1=Robin Marantz|last2=book|first2=A Joseph Henry Press|title=The People's Health:: A Memoir of Public Health and Its Evolution at Harvard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM1TAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=1996-11-04|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=9780309054928}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also opposed other public health programs, notably mass [[vaccination]] and [[mental health]] services.&lt;ref name="Henig"&gt;{{cite book | last = Henig | first = Robin Marantz | title = The People's Health | publisher = Joseph Henry Press| year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-309-05492-8 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the UN and its programs; the introduction of [[social welfare provision]]s, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and government efforts to reduce perceived inequalities in the [[social structure of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Rovere"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rovere | first = Richard H. | title = Senator Joe McCarthy | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1959 | pages = 21–22| isbn = 978-0-520-20472-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others asserted the existence of "a Communist plot to deplete the brainpower and sap the strength of a generation of American children".&lt;ref name="Henigbook1996"/&gt; Dr. Charles Bett, a prominent anti-fluoridationist, charged that fluoridation was "better than using the atom bomb because the atom bomb has to be made, has to be transported to the place it is to be set off while poisonous fluorine has been placed right beside the water supplies by the Americans themselves ready to be dumped into the water mains whenever a Communist desires!" Similarly, a right-wing newsletter, the ''American Capsule News'', claimed that "the Soviet General Staff is very happy about it. Anytime they get ready to strike, and their [[fifth column|5th column]] takes over, there are tons and tons of this poison "standing by" municipal and military water systems ready to be poured in within 15 minutes."&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt;

This controversy had a direct impact on local program during the 1950s and 1960s, where referendums on introducing fluoridation were defeated in over a thousand Florida communities. It was not until as late as the 1990s that fluoridated water was consumed by the majority of the population of the United States.&lt;ref name="Henig" /&gt;

The communist conspiracy argument declined in influence by the mid-1960s, becoming associated in the public mind with irrational fear and paranoia. It was portrayed in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', in which the character General Jack D. Ripper initiates a nuclear war in the hope of thwarting a communist plot to "sap and impurify" the "precious bodily fluids" of the American people with fluoridated water. Another satire appeared in the 1967 movie ''[[In Like Flint]]'', in which a character's fear of fluoridation is used to indicate that he is insane.

Some anti-fluoridationists claimed that the conspiracy theories were damaging their goals; Dr. Frederick Exner, an anti-fluoridation campaigner in the early 1960s, told a conference: "most people are not prepared to believe that fluoridation is a communist plot, and if you say it is, you are successfully ridiculed by the promoters. It is being done, effectively, every day ... some of the people on our side are the fluoridators' 'fifth column'."&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt;

===Later conspiracy theories===
In 1987, Ian E. Stephens authored a self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in the Australian [[New Age]] publication [[Nexus Magazine]] in 1995. In it he claimed he was told by "Charles Elliot Perkins" that: "Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him ... Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile." These statements have been dismissed by reputable [[Holocaust]] historians as untrue, but they are regularly repeated to the present day in conspiracy publications and websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Politifact Florida|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/|title=Say water fluoridation started in Nazi Germany ghettos and death camps to pacify the Jews|access-date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, on the U.S. television program ''[[Democracy Now]]'', investigative journalist and author of the book ''The Fluoride Deception'', [[Christopher Bryson]] claimed that, "the post-war campaign to fluoridate drinking water was less a public health innovation than a public relations ploy sponsored by industrial users of fluoride—including the government's nuclear weapons program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryson|first=Christopher|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/17/the_fluoride_deception_how_a_nuclear|title=The Fluoride Deception: How a Nuclear Waste Made its Way Into the Nation's Drinking Water|publisher=Democracy Now|date=17 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 US NRC report===
U.S. opponents of fluoridation were heartened by a 2006 [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report about hazards of water naturally fluoridated to high levels;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0108-74 |author=Fagin D |title=Second thoughts about fluoride |journal=Sci.

Water was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, at which point the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UoZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=fluoridering+nederland#PPA488,M1 |author=Bram van der Lek |title=De strijd tegen fluoridering |journal=De Gids |volume=139 |issue=2 |year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Court decided that authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they did not also improve safety.

IESC 1; IR 294 (3 July, 1965) |publisher=Irish Supreme Court }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the [[Constitution of Ireland]], thus establishing the doctrine of [[unenumerated rights]] in Irish constitutional law.

Fluoridation has been the subject of many [[Legal case|court cases]] wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and [[due process]] are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Cross2003/&gt; Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) ("Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question." (citations omitted)).&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Edwin, Raymond D.

'''White hat bias''' ('''WHB''') is a phrase coined by public health researchers [[David B. Allison|David Allison]] and Mark Cope (2010) to describe a purported "bias leading to the distortion of information in the service of what may be perceived to be righteous ends", which consist of both [[cherry picking]] the evidence and [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name=Cope2010/&gt; Allison and Cope explained the motivation behind this [[bias]] in terms of "righteous zeal, indignation toward certain aspects of industry", and other factors.&lt;ref name=Cope2010/&gt; 

The term [[wikt:white hat|white hat]] refers idiomatically to an ethically good person, in this case one who has a righteous goal.

==Overview==
This initial paper contrasted the treatment of research on the effects of nutritively-sweetened beverages and [[breastfeeding]] on [[obesity]]. They contrasted evidence which implicated these behaviors as risk and protective factors (respectively), comparing the treatment given to evidence for each conclusion. Their analyses confirmed that papers reporting null effects of soft drinks or breast-feeding on obesity were cited significantly less often than expected, and, when cited, were interpreted in ways that mislead readers about the underlying finding. Positive papers were cited more frequently than expected. For instance, of 207 citations of two papers finding no effects of sugared soft drink consumption on obesity, the majority of citations (84 and 66%) were misleadingly positive.&lt;ref name=Cope2010/&gt; 

A meta-analysis had been reported showing that industry-funded studies reported smaller effects than did non-industry-funded studies,&lt;ref name=Vartanian2007/&gt; the implication being that industry funding leads researchers to bias their results in favor of the funder's presumed commercial interest. Allison and Cope's reanalysis of these data indicated that it was poor studies that found larger effects, and that the industry-funded studies were larger and better run: a finding consistent with a white hat bias, and suggesting that the true effect of sugar-sweetened beverages is smaller than most studies report.

Allison and Cope suggest that [[science]] might be protected better from these effects by authors and journals practicing higher standards of probity and humility in citing the literature. Young, Ioannidis and Al-Ubaydli (2008)&lt;ref name="Young2008"/&gt; discuss related concepts, framing scientific information and journals in the context of an economic good, with the goal being to transfer knowledge from scientists to its consumers, suggesting that acknowledging the full spectrum of effects on publication and treating addressing the effects as a moral imperative may aid this goal.

==Controversy==
Having shown that industry studies were well run but that publication and citation bias existed against negative findings, and as predicted from a WHB effect, Allison&amp;mdash;being funded himself by the food and beverage industry&lt;ref name=Cope2010/&gt;&amp;mdash;became the subject of a media report by ABC condemning the influence of industry on diet science.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;
