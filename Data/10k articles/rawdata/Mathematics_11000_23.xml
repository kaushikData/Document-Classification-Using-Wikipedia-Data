'''Aleksandr Sergeyevich Merkurjev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Сергее́вич Мерку́рьев}}, born September 25, 1955&lt;ref&gt;Listed in the [http://catalog.loc.gov/ Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Russian-American mathematician, who has made major contributions to the field of [[algebra]]. Currently Merkurjev is a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

==Work==
Merkurjev's work focuses on [[algebraic group]]s, [[quadratic form]]s, [[Galois cohomology]], [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[central simple algebra]]s. In the early 1980s Merkurjev proved a fundamental result about the structure of central simple algebras of [[periodic group|period]] dividing 2, which relates the 2-torsion of the [[Brauer group]] with [[Milnor K-theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the norm residue symbol of degree 2|author=A. Merkurjev|journal=Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR |volume=261|year=1981|pages=542–547 (English trans. Soviet Math. Dokl. 24 (1982), pp.1546–1551)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent work with [[Andrei Suslin|Suslin]] this was extended to higher torsion as the [[Merkurjev–Suslin theorem]]. The full statement of  the [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]] (also  known as the Bloch-Kato conjecture) was proven by [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]].

In the late 1990s Merkurjev gave the most general approach to the notion of [[essential dimension]], introduced by [[Joe Buhler|Buhler]] and [[Zinovy Reichstein|Reichstein]], and made fundamental contributions to that field. In particular Merkurjev determined the essential p-dimension of central simple algebras of degree &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; (for a prime p) and, in joint work with [[Nikita Karpenko|Karpenko]], the essential dimension of finite ''p''-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2010-23-03/S0894-0347-10-00661-2/home.html|title=Essential p-dimension of PGL(p^2)|author=A.

==Awards==
Merkurjev won the Young Mathematician Prize of the [[Petersburg Mathematical Society]] for his work on algebraic K-theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathsoc.spb.ru/mol_mat.html|title=Young mathematician prize of the Petersburg Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Berkeley, California]], and his talk was entitled "Milnor K-theory and Galois cohomology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1986.1/|title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, August 3-11, 1986|publisher=International Mathematical Union}} Merkurjev's talk: [http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1986.1/Main/icm1986.1.0389.0393.ocr.pdf Milnor K-theory and Galois cohomology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191822/http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1986.1/Main/icm1986.1.0389.0393.ocr.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he won the [[Humboldt Prize]], an international prize awarded to renowned scholars. Merkurjev gave a plenary talk at the 2nd [[European Congress of Mathematics]] in [[Budapest, Hungary]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emis.de/ECM2/talks.html|title=Speakers and talks at the 2nd European Congress of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012 he won the [[Cole Prize]] in Algebra for his work on the essential dimension of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400567p.pdf|title=2012 Cole Prize in Algebra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a special volume  of ''Documenta Mathematica'' was published in honor of Merkurjev's sixtieth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The '''''Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis''''' is a [[scientific journal]] that is devoted to research in [[mechanics]] as a deductive, mathematical science.  The current editors in chief of the journal are [[John M. Ball]] and [[Richard D. James (scientist)|Richard D. James]].  It was founded in 1956 by [[Clifford Truesdell]] when he moved from [[Indiana University]] to [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] and lost control of a similar journal he had founded a few years previously, the ''Journal of Rational Mechanics and Analysis'' (now the ''[[Indiana University Mathematics Journal]]'').&lt;ref name="serrin"/&gt;

{{cquote|The ''Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis'' became the hallmark in the field and young scholars sought publication of their best work there as the sign of their entry into an exclusive club of perfectionists.}}

[[James Serrin]], a later editor of the Archive, adds that it became the center of a revival of mechanics as an academic discipline, and that by the time of Truesdell's retirement as editor in 1989 subscribing to it was "necessary for every fine scientific library".&lt;ref name="serrin"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Serrin | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1023/B:ELAS.0000005611.25238.29 | title = An Appreciation of Clifford Truesdell | journal = Journal of Elasticity | volume = 70 | pages = 31–74 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Beth definability''' is a result that connects implicit definability of a property to its explicit definability, specifically the theorem states that the two senses of [[definability (disambiguation)|definability]] are equivalent.

==Statement==
The theorem states that, given any two models ''A'' and ''B'' of a [[first-order theory]] ''T'' in the language L' ⊇ L such that ''A''|''L'' = ''B''|''L'' (where ''A''|''L'' is the [[reduct]] of ''A'' to ''L''), it is the case that ''A'' ⊨ φ[''a''] if and only if ''B'' ⊨ φ[''a''] (for φ a [[formula]] in L' and for all tuples a of ''A'') only if it is also the case that φ is equivalent modulo ''T'' to a formula ψ in ''L''. Less formally: a property is implicitly definable in a theory in language L (via introduction of a new symbol φ of an extended language L') only if that property is explicitly definable in that theory (by formula ψ in the original language L).

Clearly the converse holds as well, so that we have an equivalence between implicit and explicit definability. That is, a "property" is implicitly definable with respect to a theory if and only if it is explicitly definable.

The theorem does not hold if the condition is restricted to finite models. We may have ''A'' ⊨ φ[''a''] if and only if ''B'' ⊨ φ[''a''] for all pairs A,B of finite models without there being any ''L''-formula ψ equivalent to φ  modulo T.

The result was first proven by [[Evert Willem Beth]].

{{about|the table by Jost Bürgi||Canon Sinuum (disambiguation){{!}}Canon Sinuum}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}
The '''''Canon Sinuum''''' was a historic table of [[sine]]s thought to have given the sines to 8 sexagesimal places between 0 and 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] in steps of 2 [[arc seconds]]. Some authors believe that the table was only between 0 and 45 degrees. It was created by [[Jost Bürgi]] at the end of the [[16th century]]. Such tables were essential for [[navigation]] at sea. [[Johannes Kepler]] called the ''Canon Sinuum'' the most precise known table of sines.

This table is thought to be lost.

The ''Canon Sinuum'' was computed by Bürgi's [[algorithm]]s explained in his work [[Fundamentum Astronomiae]] presented to Emperor Rudolf II. in 1592.&lt;ref name="staudacher"&gt;Staudacher, S., 2014.  Jost Bürgi, Kepler und der Kaiser.  Verlag NZZ, Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Launert, Nova Kepleriana
Bürgis Kunstweg im Fundamentum Astronomiae - Entschlüsselung seines Rätsels, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms made use of differences and were one of the early uses of [[difference calculus]].&lt;ref name="folkerts"&gt;Menso Folkerts, Dieter Launert, Andreas Thom (Oct 2015). "Jost Bürgi's Method for Calculating Sines." https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03180&lt;/ref&gt; The largest trigonometrical table actually contained in the Fundamentum Astronomiae is a table giving the sines for every minute of the quadrant and to 5 to 7 sexagesimal places.

The manuscript of Fundamentum Astronomiae is now in the collection of the Biblioteka Uniwersytecka in [[Wrocław]], Poland.

Two versions of this measure exist: the global and the local. The global version was designed to give an overall indication of the clustering in the network, whereas the local gives an indication of the embeddedness of single nodes.

== Global clustering coefficient ==
The '''global clustering coefficient''' is based on triplets of nodes. A triplet is three nodes that are connected by either two (open triplet) or three (closed triplet) undirected ties. A [[triangle graph]] therefore includes three closed triplets, one centered on each of the nodes ([[Nota bene|n.b.]] this means the three triplets in a triangle come from overlapping selections of nodes). The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets (or 3 x triangles) over the total number of triplets (both open and closed). The first attempt to measure it was made by Luce and Perry (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure gives an indication of the clustering in the whole network (global), and can be applied to both undirected and directed networks (often called transitivity, see Wasserman and Faust, 1994, page 243&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wasserman]], Katherine Faust, 1994. ''Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The global clustering coefficient is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\mbox{number of closed triplets}}{\mbox{number of all triplets (open and closed)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of closed triplets has also been referred to as 3 × triangles in the literature, so:

: &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{3 \times \mbox{number of triangles}}{\mbox{number of all triplets}}&lt;/math&gt;.

A generalisation to [[weighted networks]] was proposed by Opsahl and Panzarasa (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Local clustering coefficient  ==
[[Image:Clustering coefficient example.svg|thumb|Example local clustering coefficient on an undirected graph. The local clustering coefficient of the blue node is computed as the proportion of connections among its neighbours which are actually realised compared with the number of all possible connections. In the figure, the blue node has three neighbours, which can have a maximum of 3 connections among them. In the top part of the figure all three possible connections are realised (thick black segments), giving a local clustering coefficient of 1. In the middle part of the figure only one connection is realised (thick black line) and 2 connections are missing (dotted red lines), giving a local cluster coefficient of 1/3. Finally, none of the possible connections among the neighbours of the blue node are realised, producing a local clustering coefficient value of 0.]] The '''local clustering coefficient''' of a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] (node) in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] quantifies how close its [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbours]] are to being a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] (complete graph). [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] introduced the measure in 1998 to determine whether a graph is a [[small-world network]].

A graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; formally consists of a set of vertices &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and a set of edges &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; between them. An edge &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; connects vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; with vertex &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]]  &lt;math&gt; N_i &lt;/math&gt; for a vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as its immediately connected neighbours as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;N_i = \{v_j : e_{ij} \in E \lor e_{ji} \in E\}.&lt;/math&gt;

We define &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; as the number of vertices, &lt;math&gt;|N_i|&lt;/math&gt;, in the neighbourhood, &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;, of a vertex.

The local clustering coefficient &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; for a vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is then given by the proportion of links between the vertices within its neighbourhood divided by the number of links that could possibly exist between them. For a directed graph, &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is distinct from &lt;math&gt;e_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore for each neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;k_i(k_i-1)&lt;/math&gt; links that could exist among the vertices within the neighbourhood (&lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of neighbours of a vertex). Thus, the '''local clustering coefficient for directed graphs''' is given as &lt;ref name=WattsStrogatz1998 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C_i = \frac{|\{e_{jk}: v_j,v_k \in N_i, e_{jk} \in E\}|}{k_i(k_i-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An undirected graph has the property that &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; are considered identical. Therefore, if a vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbours, &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_i(k_i-1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; edges could exist among the vertices within the neighbourhood. Thus, the '''local clustering coefficient for undirected graphs''' can be defined as

: &lt;math&gt;C_i = \frac{2|\{e_{jk}: v_j,v_k \in N_i, e_{jk} \in E\}|}{k_i(k_i-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_G(v)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of triangles on &lt;math&gt;v \in V(G)&lt;/math&gt; for undirected graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_G(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of subgraphs of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with 3 edges and 3 vertices, one of which is &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\tau_G(v)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of triples on &lt;math&gt;v \in G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\tau_G(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of subgraphs (not necessarily induced) with 2 edges and 3 vertices, one of which is &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and such that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is incident to both edges. Then we can also define the clustering coefficient as

: &lt;math&gt;C_i = \frac{\lambda_G(v)}{\tau_G(v)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is simple to show that the two preceding definitions are the same, since

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_G(v) = C({k_i},2) = \frac{1}{2}k_i(k_i-1).&lt;/math&gt;

These measures are 1 if every neighbour connected to &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is also connected to every other vertex within the neighbourhood, and 0 if no vertex that is connected to &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; connects to any other vertex that is connected to &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Network average clustering coefficient ===
As an alternative to the global clustering coefficient, the overall level of clustering in a network is measured by Watts and Strogatz&lt;ref name=WattsStrogatz1998 /&gt; as the average of the local clustering coefficients of all the vertices &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; :&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kemper |first=Andreas|title=Valuation of Network Effects in Software Markets: A Complex Networks Approach|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9783790823660|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isdza0IiXbUC&amp;pg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{C} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i.&lt;/math&gt;

It is worth noting that this metric places more weight on the low degree nodes, while the transitivity ratio places more weight on the high degree nodes. In fact, a weighted average where each local clustering score is weighted by &lt;math&gt;k_i(k_i-1)&lt;/math&gt; is identical to the global clustering coefficient{{Original research inline|date=December 2016}}.

A graph is considered [[Small-world network|small-world]],  if the graph has a small [[distance (graph theory)|mean-shortest path length]] that scales with the natural log of the number of nodes in the network,
&lt;math&gt;\ln{N}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://networksciencebook.com/4#ultra-small&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, a [[random graph]] is small-world, while a lattice is not, and scale-free graphs are often considered ultra-small world, as their mean-shortest path length scales with &lt;math&gt;\ln{\ln{N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

A generalisation to [[weighted networks]] was proposed by Barrat et al. (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1= A. |last1= Barrat |first2= M. |last2= Barthelemy |first3= R. |last3= Pastor-Satorras |first4= A. |last4= Vespignani  | title = The architecture of complex weighted networks | year = 2004 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  | volume = 101 | pages = 3747&amp;ndash;3752 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0400087101 | issue = 11 | pmid = 15007165 | pmc = 374315 | bibcode=2004PNAS..101.3747B|arxiv = cond-mat/0311416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a redefinition to [[bipartite graph]]s (also called two-mode networks) by Latapy et al.

Alternative generalisations to weighted and [[directed graph]]s have been provided by Fagiolo (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1= G. |last1= Fagiolo | title = Clustering in complex directed networks | year = 2007 | journal = Physical Review E  | volume = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Clemente and Grassi (2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = G.P. |last1= Clemente |first2= R. |last2= Grassi | title = Directed clustering in weighted networks: A new perspective | year = 2018 | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume = 107 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;38 | doi = 10.1016/j.chaos.2017.12.007|arxiv= 1706.07322 |bibcode= 2018CSF...107...26C }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Los, ''Computational Finance'' World Scientific Pub Co Inc (December 2000) 978-9810244972&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational finance emphasizes practical [[numerical analysis|numerical methods]] rather than [[mathematical proof]]s and focuses on techniques that apply directly to [[economics|economic analyses]].&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;Mario J. Miranda  and Paul L. Fackler, ''Applied Computational Economics and Finance'', The MIT Press (September 16, 2002) 978-0262134200&lt;/ref&gt; It is an interdisciplinary field between [[mathematical finance]] and [[numerical analysis|numerical methods]].&lt;ref name=Ugur&gt;Omur Ugur, ''Introduction to Computational Finance'', Imperial College Press (December 22, 2008) 978-1848161924&lt;/ref&gt; Two major areas are efficient and accurate computation of [[fair value]]s of [[security (finance)|financial securities]] and the modeling of [[stochastic]] [[time series|price series]].&lt;ref name=Duan&gt;Jin-Chuan Duan, Wolfgang Karl Härdle and James E. Gentle (editors), ''Handbook of Computational Finance'', Springer (October 25, 2011) 978-3642172533&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The birth of computational finance as a discipline can be traced to [[Harry Markowitz]] in the early 1950s. Markowitz conceived of the portfolio selection problem as an exercise in mean-variance optimization. This required more computer power than was available at the time, so he worked on useful algorithms for approximate solutions.&lt;ref name=Markowitz&gt;Harry M. Markowitz, ''Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments'', Wiley, second edition (September 3, 1991) 978-1557861085&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical finance began with the same insight, but diverged by making simplifying assumptions to express relations in simple [[closed-form expression|closed forms]] that did not require sophisticated computer science to evaluate.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Justin Fox, ''The Myth of the Rational Market: A History of Risk, Reward, and Delusion on Wall Street'',  HarperBusiness (June 9, 2009) 978-0060598990&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, hedge fund managers such as [[Edward O. Thorp|Ed Thorp]]&lt;ref name=Poundstone&gt;William Poundstone, ''Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street'', Hill and Wang (September 19, 2006) 978-0809045990&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Goodkin]] (working with Harry Markowitz, [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Robert C. Merton]])&lt;ref name=Goodkin&gt;Michael Goodkin, ''The Wrong Answer Faster: The Inside Story of Making the Machine that Trades Trillions'', Wiley, (February 21, 2012) 978-1118133408
&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the use of computers in [[arbitrage]] trading. In academics, sophisticated computer processing was needed by researchers such as [[Eugene Fama]] in order to analyze large amounts of financial data in support of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;

During the 1970s, the main focus of computational finance shifted to [[valuation of options|options pricing]] and analyzing [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] [[securitization|securitizations]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Aaron Brown, ''Red-Blooded Risk: The Secret History of Wall Street'', Wiley (October 11, 2011) 978-1118043868&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a group of young [[quantitative analyst|quantitative practitioners]] who became known as “rocket scientists” arrived on [[Wall Street]] and brought along [[personal computer]]s. This led to an explosion of both the amount and variety of computational finance applications.&lt;ref name=Ehlers&gt;John F. Ehlers, ''Rocket Science for Traders'', Wiley (July 20, 2001) 978-0471405672&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new techniques came from [[signal processing]] and [[natural language processing|speech recognition]] rather than traditional fields of computational economics like [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] and [[time series]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Ehlers /&gt;

By the end of the 1980s, the winding down of the [[Cold War]] brought a large group of displaced [[physicist]]s and [[applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]], many from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], into finance. These people become known as “[[Financial engineering|financial engineers]]” (“quant” is a term that includes both rocket scientists and financial engineers, as well as quantitative portfolio managers).&lt;ref name=Brown1&gt;Aaron Brown, ''The Poker Face of Wall Street'', Wiley (March 31, 2006) 978-0470127315&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a second major extension of the range of computational methods used in finance, also a move away from personal computers to [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[supercomputer]]s.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; Around this time computational finance became recognized as a distinct academic subfield. The first degree program in computational finance was offered by Carnegie Mellon University in 1994.&lt;ref name=CM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/CCF/index.html|title= Center for Computational Finance|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2012-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the last 20 years, the field of computational finance has expanded into virtually every area of finance, and the demand for practitioners has grown dramatically.&lt;ref name=Seydel /&gt; Moreover, many specialized companies have grown up to supply computational finance software and services.&lt;ref name=Goodkin /&gt;

''Computational mathematics'' may refer to two different aspect of the relation between computing and mathematics. 

Computational applied mathematics consists roughly of using mathematics for allowing and improving [[computer]] computation in [[applied mathematics]]. Computational mathematics may also refer to the use of computers for mathematics itself. This includes the use of computers for mathematical computations ([[computer algebra]]), the study of what can (and cannot) be computerized in mathematics ([[effective method]]s), which computations may be done with present technology ([[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]), and which proofs can be done on computers ([[proof assistant]]s).

Both aspects of computational mathematics involves [[mathematics|mathematical]] research in mathematics as well as in areas of science where [[computation|computing]] plays a central and essential role—that, is almost all sciences—, and emphasize algorithms, numerical methods, and [[symbolic computation]]s.&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;[[National Science Foundation]], Division of Mathematical Science, [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5390 Program description PD 06-888 Computational Mathematics], 2006.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''Droz-Farny line theorem''' is a property of two perpendicular lines through the [[orthocenter]] of an arbitrary triangle.

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a triangle with vertices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be its orthocenter (the common point of its three [[altitude (triangle)|altitude lines]].  Let &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; be any two mutually perpendicular lines through &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; be the points where &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; intersects the side lines &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CA&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  Similarly, let Let &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be the points where &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; intersects those side lines.  The Droz-Farny line theorem says that the midpoints of the three segments &lt;math&gt;A_1A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1B_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_1C_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[collinear]].&lt;ref name=droz1899/&gt;&lt;ref name=ayme2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;

The theorem was stated by [[Arnold Droz-Farny]] in 1899,&lt;ref name=droz1899/&gt; but it is not clear whether he had a proof.&lt;ref name=hismat/&gt;

==Goormaghtigh's generalization==
A generalization of the Droz-Farny line theorem was proved in 1930 by [[René Goormaghtigh]].&lt;ref name=goorm1930/&gt;

As above, let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a triangle with vertices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be any point distinct from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be any line through &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; be points on the side lines &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CA&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, such that the lines &lt;math&gt;PA_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;PB_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;PC_1&lt;/math&gt; are the images of the lines &lt;math&gt;PA&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;PB&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;PC&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, by reflection against the line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Goormaghtigh's theorem then says that the points &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; are collinear.

The Droz-Farny line theorem is a special case of this result, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the orthocenter of triangle &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

== Dao's generalization ==
The theorem was further generalized by [[Dao Thanh Oai]]. The generalization as follows:

'''First generalization:''' Let ABC be a triangle, ''P'' be a point on the plane, let three parallel segments AA', BB', CC' such that its midpoints and ''P'' are collinear. Then PA', PB', PC' meet ''BC, CA, AB'' respectively at three collinear points.&lt;ref name=hoang2014/&gt;

 [[File:Daotheoremonconic1.svg|thumb|right|350px|Dao's second generalization]]

'''Second generalization:''' Let a [[conic]] S and a [[Point (geometry)|point]] P  on the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]. Construct three [[Line (geometry)|lines]]  d&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; through P such that they meet the conic at A, A';   B, B'  ;  C, C' respectively. Let D  be a point on the [[Pole and polar|polar]] of point P with respect to (S) or D lies on the conic (S). Let DA' ∩ BC =A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; DB' ∩ AC = B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; DC' ∩ AB= C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  are collinear. &lt;ref name=G.Ng.Nguyen2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeoffSmith2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=O.T.Dao_cutheknot2013/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">In the [[mathematical]] discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''edge  space''' and '''vertex space''' of an [[undirected graph]] are [[vector space]]s defined in terms of the [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] and [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] sets, respectively. These vector spaces make it possible to use techniques of [[linear algebra]] in studying the graph.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite undirected graph. The '''vertex space''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' is the vector space over the [[finite field]] of two elements 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}:=\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; of all functions &lt;math&gt;V\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  Every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(G)&lt;/math&gt; naturally corresponds the subset of ''V'' which assigns a 1 to its vertices.  Also every subset of ''V'' is uniquely represented in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(G)&lt;/math&gt; by its characteristic function. The '''edge space''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-vector space freely generated by the edge set ''E''. The dimension of the vertex space is thus the number of vertices of the graph, while the dimension of the edge space is the number of edges.

These definitions can be made more explicit. For example, we can describe the edge space as follows:
* elements of the vector space are subsets of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, that is, as a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[power set]] of ''E''
* [[vector addition]] is defined as the [[symmetric difference]]: &lt;math&gt;P+Q:=P \triangle Q \qquad P,Q \in \mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[scalar multiplication]] is defined by:
**&lt;math&gt;0 \cdot P := \emptyset \qquad P \in \mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt; 
** &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot P := P \qquad P \in \mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt;
The [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] subsets of ''E'' form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can also think of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(G)&lt;/math&gt; as the power set of ''V'' made into a vector space with similar vector addition and scalar multiplication as defined for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
The [[incidence matrix]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; for a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defines one possible [[linear transformation]]
:&lt;math&gt;H:\mathcal{E}(G) \to \mathcal{V}(G)&lt;/math&gt;
between the edge space and the [[vertex space]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The incidence matrix of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as a linear transformation, maps each edge to its two [[incident (graph theory)|incident]] vertices. Let &lt;math&gt;vu&lt;/math&gt; be the edge between &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;H(vu) = v+u&lt;/math&gt;

The [[cycle space]] and the [[cut space]] are [[linear subspace]]s of the edge space.

Robinson]]) knows the actuarial statistics and becomes suspicious
* ''[[Escape Clause (film)|Escape Clause]]'' (1996) - [[Andrew McCarthy]] plays Richard Ramsay in an actuarial thriller; to quote TVguide.com, "The makers of this direct-to-video release thought the world was ready for a thriller about an insurance actuary. They thought wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.tvguide.com/escape-clause/132816]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' (1999) - [[Edward Norton]] plays the protagonist, who briefly describes that his job entails the assessment of risk associated with car accidents for an insurance company; though not explicitly stated, he performs the job of an underwriter who uses actuarially derived premiums to benchmark quotes

==Literature==
*''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'' - by [[John Hodgman]]; portrays actuaries as [[prophet]]s who predict the future, and are organized into various [[guild]]s; they have various ethics, such as not predicting the date of one's own death
* ''[[Batman villains|Batman]]'' - comic series which featured a villain named the Actuary (Detective Comics #683-4 (March–April 1995)), a mathematical genius who applies formulae to aid the Penguin in committing crimes.
* ''Bet Me'' - by [[Jennifer Crusie]]; the main character, Minerva Dobbs, is a thirty-something actuary looking for love
*''Un Certain Monsieur Blot'' - by [[Pierre Daninos]]; Mr. Blot is an actuary, who wins a competition as the most average man in France; the book includes the acerbic observation that “there were two kinds of actuaries – those who were still doing actuarial work and those who had found something better to do”
*''[[The Colour of Magic]]'' and ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'' are part of [[Terry Pratchett]]’s [[Discworld]] fantasy series and feature [[Twoflower]], the "actuary and world’s first tourist"
*''The [[Foundation Trilogy]]'' - by Isaac Asimov; often considered one of the greatest science fiction works of all time{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} and features "psycho-historians," a sort of hidden priesthood that manipulates politics and economics on a galactic scale to accomplish the goals of peace and prosperity. Part of the theory is that on a planetary scale, people are not predictable but on a galactic scale, the law of large numbers (i.e., the Central Limit Theorem) is valid and therefore, the reactions of the galactic civilization, as a whole, are predictable. Given the characteristics of psycho-historians, they are very much like actuaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''geli''' is a [[block device]]-layer [[disk encryption]] system written for [[FreeBSD]], introduced in version 6.0. It uses the [[GEOM]] disk framework. It was designed and implemented by Paweł Jakub Dawidek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Encrypting disk partitions
| author=Lucky Green
| work=FreeBSD handbook
| accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design details ==
geli was initially written to protect data on a user's computer in situations of physical theft of hardware, disallowing the thief access to the protected data. This has changed over time with the introduction of optional data authentication/integrity verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=326862+0+archive/2006/freebsd-current/20060611.freebsd-current

| first=Pawel Jakub
| last=Dawidek
| date=2006-06-08
| accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

geli allows the key to consist of several information components (a user entered passphrase, random bits from a file, etc.), permits multiple keys (a user key and a company key, for example) and can attach a provider with a random, one-time key. The user passphrase is strengthened with [[PKCS#5]].&lt;ref name="manpage"&gt;{{cite web

| title=GELI(8)
| work=FreeBSD man pages
| accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from GBDE ==
The geli utility is different from [[gbde]] in that it offers different features and uses a different scheme for doing cryptographic work. It supports the crypto framework within FreeBSD, allowing hardware cryptographic acceleration if available, as well as supporting more cryptographic algorithms (currently [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], [[Triple DES]], [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]] and [[Camellia (cipher)|Camellia]]) and data authentication/integrity verification via [[MD5]], [[SHA1]], [[RIPEMD160]], [[SHA256]], [[SHA384]] or [[SHA512]] as [[HMAC|Hash Message Authentication Code]]s.&lt;ref name="manpage"/&gt;

'''Grøstl''' is a [[cryptographic hash function]] submitted to the [[NIST hash function competition]] by Praveen Gauravaram, [[Lars Knudsen]], Krystian Matusiewicz, Florian Mendel, Christian Rechberger, Martin Schläffer, and Søren S. Thomsen. Grøstl was chosen as one of the five finalists of the competition. It uses the same [[S-box]] as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] in a custom construction.  The authors claim speeds of up to 21.4 [[cycles per byte]] on an [[Intel Core 2|Intel Core 2 Duo]].

According to the submission document, the name "Grøstl" is a multilingual play-on-words, referring to an Austrian dish that is very similar to [[hash (food)]].

Like other hash functions in the MD5/SHA family, Grøstl divides the input into blocks and iteratively computes ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').  However, Grøstl maintains a hash state at least twice the size of the final output (512 or 1024 bits), which is only truncated at the end of hash computation.

The compression function ''f'' is based on a pair of 256- or 512-bit permutation functions ''P'' and ''Q'', and is defined as:
: ''f''(''h'', ''m'') = ''P''(''h'' ⊕ ''m'') ⊕ ''Q''(''m'') ⊕ ''h''

The permutation functions ''P'' and ''Q'' are heavily based on the [[Rijndael]] (AES) block cipher, but operate on 8×8 or 8×16 arrays of bytes, rather than 4×4.  Like AES, each round consists of four operations:
# AddRoundKey (the Grøstl round keys are fixed, but differ between P and Q)
# SubBytes (this uses the Rijndael S-box, allowing sharing with AES implementations)
# ShiftBytes (expanded compared to AES, this also differs between P and Q, and 512- and 1024-bit versions)
# MixColumns (using an 8×8 matrix rather than Rijndael's 4×4)

Unlike Rijndael, all rounds are identical and there is no final AddRoundKey operation.  10 rounds are recommended for the 512-bit permutation, and 14 rounds for the 1024-bit version.

The final double-width hash receives a final output transformation of
: Ω(''h'') = ''h'' ⊕ ''P''(''h'')
and is then truncated to the desired width.  This is equivalent to applying a final iteration of the compression function using an all-zero message block ''m'', followed by a (cryptographically insignificant) exclusive-or with the fixed constant ''Q''(0).

==Examples of Grøstl hashes==
Hash values of empty string.
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-224("")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x f2e180fb5947be964cd584e22e496242c6a329c577fc4ce8c36d34c3
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-256("")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x 1a52d11d550039be16107f9c58db9ebcc417f16f736adb2502567119f0083467
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-384("")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x ac353c1095ace21439251007862d6c62f829ddbe6de4f78e68d310a9205a736d8b11d99bffe448f57a1cfa2934f044a5
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-512("")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x 6d3ad29d279110eef3adbd66de2a0345a77baede1557f5d099fce0c03d6dc2ba8e6d4a6633dfbd66053c20faa87d1a11f39a7fbe4a6c2f009801370308fc4ad8

Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a mostly different hash, due to the [[avalanche effect]]. For example, adding a period to the end of the sentence:
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-256("[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x 8c7ad62eb26a21297bc39c2d7293b4bd4d3399fa8afab29e970471739e28b301
 &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;Grøstl-256("[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]].")&lt;/span&gt;
 0x f48290b1bcacee406a0429b993adb8fb3d065f4b09cbcdb464a631d4a0080aaf

In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''Hamiltonian decomposition''' of a given graph is a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the edges of the graph into [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s. Hamiltonian decompositions have been studied both for [[undirected graph]]s and for [[directed graph]]s; in the undirected case,
a Hamiltonian decomposition can also be described as a [[graph factorization|2-factorization]] of the graph such that each factor is connected. For such a decomposition to exist in an undirected graph, it must be connected and [[regular graph|regular]] of even [[degree (graph theory)|degree]].
A directed graph with such a decomposition must be [[strongly connected graph|strongly connected]] and all vertices must have the same in-degree and out-degree as each other, but this degree does not need to be even.{{r|b}}

It is known that every [[complete graph]] with an odd number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of vertices has a Hamiltonian decomposition. This result, which is a special case of the [[Oberwolfach problem]] of decomposing complete graphs into isomorphic 2-factors, was attributed to Walecki by [[Édouard Lucas]] in 1892.
Walecki's construction places &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; of the vertices into a regular polygon, and covers the complete graph in this subset of vertices with &lt;math&gt;(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; Hamiltonian paths that zigzag across the polygon, with each path rotated from each other path by a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\pi/(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;.
The paths can then all be completed to Hamiltonian cycles by connecting their ends through the remaining vertex.{{r|a}}

The directed case of complete graphs are [[Tournament (graph theory)|tournaments]]. Answering a 1968 conjecture by Kelly, [[Daniela Kühn]] and [[Deryk Osthus]] proved in 2012 that every sufficiently large regular tournament has a Hamiltonian decomposition.{{r|ko}}

Testing whether an arbitrary graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition is [[NP-complete]], both in the directed and undirected cases.{{r|p}}

In [[number theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''Hilbert number''' is a [[positive integer]] of the form {{math|4''n'' + 1}} ({{harvtxt|Flannery|Flannery|2000|p=35}}). The Hilbert numbers were named after [[David Hilbert]].

The sequence of Hilbert numbers begins 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ... {{OEIS|id=A016813}}).  A '''Hilbert prime''' is a Hilbert number that is not divisible by a smaller Hilbert number (other than 1). The sequence of Hilbert primes begins

:5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 49, ... {{OEIS|id=A057948}}.

A Hilbert prime is not necessarily a [[prime number]]; for example, 21 is a [[composite number]] since {{math|1=21 = 3 &amp;sdot; 7}}.  However, 21 {{em|is}} a Hilbert prime since neither 3 nor 7 (the only factors of 21 other than 1 and itself) are Hilbert numbers.  It follows from multiplication [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4 that a Hilbert prime is either a prime number of the form {{math|4''n'' + 1}} (called a [[Pythagorean prime]]), or a [[semiprime]] of the form {{math|(4''a'' + 3) &amp;sdot; (4''b'' + 3)}}.

In [[geometry]], '''inversive geometry''' is the study of those properties of figures that are preserved by a generalization of a type of transformation of the [[Plane (mathematics)|Euclidean plane]], called ''[[Inversion in a sphere|inversion]]''. These transformations preserve angles and [[function (mathematics)|map]] generalized [[circle]]s into generalized circles, where a ''generalized circle'' means either a circle or a [[line (mathematics)|line]] (loosely speaking, a circle with [[infinity|infinite]] [[radius]]). Many difficult problems in geometry become much more tractable when an inversion is applied.

The concept of inversion can be [[#Inversion in higher dimensions|generalized to higher-dimensional spaces]].

== Circle inversion ==

=== Inverse of a point ===

[[File:Inversion illustration1.svg|''P{{'}}''|right|250px|thumb| ''P''{{'}} is the inverse of ''P'' with respect to the circle.]]

To invert a number in arithmetic usually means to "take its reciprocal".  A closely related idea in geometry is that of "inverting" a point.  In the plane, the '''inverse''' of a point ''P'' with respect to a ''reference circle (Ø)'' with center ''O'' and radius ''r'' is a point ''P''{{'}}, lying on the ray from ''O'' through ''P'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;OP\times OP^{\prime} =r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called '''circle inversion''' or '''plane inversion'''.  The inversion taking any point ''P'' (other than ''O'') to its image ''P''{{'}} also takes ''P''{{'}}  back to ''P'', so the result of applying the same inversion twice is the identity transformation on all the points of the plane other than ''O''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To make inversion an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] it is necessary to introduce a [[point at infinity]], a single point placed on all the lines, and extend the inversion, by definition, to interchange the center ''O'' and this point at infinity.

It follows from the definition that the inversion of any point inside the reference circle must lie outside it, and vice versa, with the center and the [[point at infinity]] changing positions, whilst any point on the circle is unaffected (is ''invariant'' under inversion). In summary, the nearer a point to the center, the further away its transformation, and vice versa.

==== Compass and straightedge construction (point outside circle) ====
[[File:Inversion in circle.svg|right|250px |thumb| To construct the inverse ''P{{'}}'' of a point ''P'' outside a circle ''Ø'':  Let ''r'' be the radius of ''Ø''. Right triangles ''OPN'' and ''ONP{{'}}'' are similar. ''OP'' is to ''r'' as ''r'' is to ''OP{{'}}''.]]

To [[Compass and straightedge constructions|construct]] the inverse ''P{{'}}'' of a point ''P'' outside a circle ''Ø'':
* Draw the segment from ''O'' (center of circle ''Ø'') to ''P''.
* Let ''M'' be the midpoint of ''OP''.
* Draw the circle ''c'' with center ''M'' going through ''P''.
* Let ''N'' and ''N{{'}}'' be the points where ''Ø'' and ''c'' intersect.
* Draw segment ''NN{{'}}''.
* ''P{{'}}'' is where ''OP'' and ''NN{{'}}'' intersect.

==== Compass and straightedge construction (point inside circle) ====
To [[Compass and straightedge constructions|construct]] the inverse ''P'' of a point ''P{{'}}'' inside a circle ''Ø'':
* Draw ray ''r'' from ''O'' (center of circle ''Ø'') through ''P{{'}}''.
* Draw line ''s'' through ''P{{'}}'' perpendicular to ''r''.
* Let ''N'' be one of the points where ''Ø'' and ''s'' intersect.
* Draw the segment ''ON''.
* Draw line ''t'' through ''N'' perpendicular to ''ON''.
*  ''P'' is where ray ''r'' and line ''t'' intersect.

=== Dutta's construction ===
There is a construction of the inverse point to ''A'' with respect to a circle ''P'' that is ''independent'' of whether ''A'' is inside or outside ''P''.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;Dutta, Surajit (2014) [http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201422index.html A simple property of isosceles triangles with applications], [[Forum Geometricorum]] 14: 237–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a circle ''P'' with center ''O'' and a point ''A'' which may lie inside or outside the circle ''P''.
* Take the intersection point ''C'' of the ray ''OA'' with the circle ''P''.
* Connect the point ''C'' with an arbitrary point ''B'' on the circle ''P'' (different from ''C'')
* Reflect the ray ''BA'' in the line ''BC'' and let ''h'' be the reflection which cuts the ray ''OC'' in a point ''A''’. ''A''’ is the inverse point of ''A'' with respect to circle ''P''.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;{{rp|§ 3.2}}

===Properties===

File:Inversion.gif|Inversion with respect to a circle does not map the center of the circle to the center of its image
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The inversion of a set of points in the plane with respect to a circle is the set of inverses of these points.  The following properties make circle inversion useful.
*A circle that passes through the center ''O'' of the reference circle inverts to a line not passing through ''O'', but parallel to the tangent to the original circle at ''O'', and vice versa; whereas a line passing through ''O'' is inverted into itself (but not pointwise invariant).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A circle not passing through ''O'' inverts to a circle not passing through ''O''. If the circle meets the reference circle, these invariant points of intersection are also on the inverse circle. A circle (or line) is unchanged by inversion if and only if it is [[orthogonal]] to the reference circle at the points of intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional properties include:
*If a circle ''q'' passes through two distinct points A and A' which are inverses with respect to a circle ''k'', then the circles ''k'' and ''q'' are orthogonal.
*If the circles ''k'' and ''q'' are orthogonal, then a straight line passing through the center O of ''k'' and intersecting ''q'', does so at inverse points with respect to ''k''.
*Given a triangle OAB in which O is the center of a circle ''k'', and points A' and B' inverses of A and B with respect to ''k'', then
:: &lt;math&gt; \angle OAB = \angle OB'A' \ \text{ and }\ \angle OBA = \angle OA'B'.&lt;/math&gt;
*The points of intersection of two circles ''p'' and ''q'' orthogonal to a circle ''k'', are inverses with respect to ''k''.
*If M and M' are inverse points with respect to a circle ''k'' on two curves m and m', also inverses with respect to ''k'', then the tangents to m and m' at the points M and M' are either perpendicular to the straight line MM' or form with this line an isosceles triangle with base MM'.
*Inversion leaves the measure of angles unaltered, but reverses the orientation of oriented angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application===

For a circle not passing through the center of inversion, the center of the circle being inverted and the center of its image under inversion are [[collinear]] with the center of the reference circle. This fact can be used to prove that the [[Euler line]] of the [[intouch triangle]] of a triangle coincides with its OI line. The proof roughly goes as below:

Invert with respect to the [[incircle]] of triangle ''ABC''. The [[medial triangle]] of the intouch triangle is inverted into triangle ''ABC'', meaning the circumcenter of the medial triangle, that is, the nine-point center of the intouch triangle, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ''ABC'' are [[collinear]].

Any two non-intersecting circles may be inverted into [[concentric]] circles. Then the [[inversive distance]] (usually denoted δ) is defined as the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the radii of the two concentric circles.

In addition, any two non-intersecting circles may be inverted into [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] circles, using circle of inversion centered at a point on the [[circle of antisimilitude]].

The [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]] is a mechanical implementation of inversion in a circle. It provides an exact solution to the important problem of converting between linear and circular motion.

==== Pole and polar ====
{{main article|pole and polar}}

If point ''R'' is the inverse of point ''P'' then the lines [[perpendicular]]  to the line ''PR'' through one of the points is the [[pole and polar|polar]] of the other point (the [[pole and polar|pole]]).

Poles and polars have several useful properties:

* If a point '''P''' lies on a line ''l'', then the pole '''L''' of the line ''l'' lies on the polar ''p'' of point '''P'''.
* If a point '''P''' moves along a line ''l'', its polar ''p'' rotates about the pole '''L''' of the line ''l''.
* If two tangent lines can be drawn from a pole to the circle, then its polar passes through both tangent points.
* If a point lies on the circle, its polar is the tangent through this point.
* If a point '''P''' lies on its own polar line, then '''P''' is on the circle.
* Each line has exactly one pole.

==Inversions in three dimensions==
[[File:Inv-kugel.svg|300px|thumb|Inversion of a sphere at the red sphere]]
[[File:Inv-ellipsoid.svg|300px|thumb|Inversion of a spheroid (at the red sphere)]]
[[File:Inv-hyperboloid.svg|300px|thumb|Inversion of a hyperboloid of one sheet]]

Circle inversion is generalizable to [[Inversion in a sphere|sphere inversion]] in three dimensions. The inversion of a point ''P'' in 3D with respect to a reference sphere centered at a point ''O'' with radius ''R'' is a point ''P'' ' such that &lt;math&gt;OP \times OP^{\prime} =R^2&lt;/math&gt; and the points ''P'' and ''P'' ' are on the same ray starting at ''O''. As with the 2D version, a sphere inverts to a sphere, except that if a sphere passes through the center ''O'' of the reference sphere, then it inverts to a plane. Any plane not passing through ''O'', inverts to a sphere touching at ''O''. A circle, that is, the intersection of a sphere with a secant plane, inverts into a circle, except that if the circle passes through ''O'' it inverts into a line. This reduces to the 2D case when the secant plane passes through ''O'', but is a true 3D phenomenon if the secant plane does not pass through ''O''.

=== Examples ===

==== Sphere ====
The simplest surface (besides a plane) is the sphere. The first picture shows a non trivial inversion (the center of the sphere is not the center of inversion) of a sphere together with two orthogonal intersecting pencils of circles.

==== Cylinder, cone, torus ====
The inversion of a cylinder, cone, or torus results in a [[Dupin cyclide|Dupin cyclyde]].

==== Spheroid ====
A spheroid is a surface of revolution and contains a pencil of circles which is mapped onto a pencil of circles (see picture). The inverse image of a spheroid is a surface of degree 4.

==== Hyperboloid of one sheet ====
A hyperboloid of one sheet, which is a surface of revolution contains a pencil of circles which is mapped onto a pencil of circles. A hyperboloid of one sheet contains additional two pencils of lines, which are mapped onto pencils of circles. The picture shows one such line (blue) and its inversion.

=== Stereographic projection as the inversion of a sphere ===
[[File:Inv-stereogr-proj.svg|250px|thumb|Stereographic projection as an inversion of a sphere]]
A [[stereographic projection]] usually projects a sphere from a point  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (north pole) of the sphere onto the tangent plane at the opposite point &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (south pole). This mapping can be performed by an inversion of the sphere onto its tangent plane. If the sphere (to be projected) has the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2 = -z&lt;/math&gt; (alternately written &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+(z+\tfrac{1}{2})^2=\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;; center &lt;math&gt;(0,0,-0.5)&lt;/math&gt;, radius &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;, green in the picture), then it will be mapped by the inversion at the unit sphere (red) onto the tangent plane at point &lt;math&gt;S=(0,0,-1)&lt;/math&gt;. The lines through the center of inversion (point &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) are mapped onto themselves. They are the projection lines of the stereographic projection.

=== 6-sphere coordinates ===

The [[6-sphere coordinates]] are a coordinate system for three-dimensional space obtained by inverting the [[Cartesian coordinates]].

==Axiomatics and generalization==
One of the first to consider foundations of inversive geometry was [[Mario Pieri]] in 1911 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pieri (1911,12) "Nuovi principia di geometria della inversion", ''Giornal di Matematiche di Battaglini'' 49:49&amp;ndash;96 &amp; 50:106&amp;ndash;140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Kasner]] wrote his thesis on "Invariant theory of the inversion group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 1986367 | pages = 430–498 | last1 = Kasner | first1 = E. | title = The Invariant Theory of the Inversion Group: Geometry Upon a Quadric Surface | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | journal = [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | year = 1900 | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9947-1900-1500550-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the [[mathematical structure]] of inversive geometry has been interpreted as an [[incidence structure]] where the generalized circles are called "blocks": In [[incidence geometry]], any [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] together with a single [[point at infinity]] forms a [[Möbius plane]], also known as an ''inversive plane''. The point at infinity is added to all the lines. These Möbius planes can be described axiomatically and exist in both finite and infinite versions.

A [[Model (model theory)|model]] for the Möbius plane that comes from the Euclidean plane is the [[Riemann sphere]].

==Invariant==
The [[cross-ratio]] between 4 points &lt;math&gt;x, y, z, w&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under an inversion. In particular if O is the centre of the inversion and &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; are distances to the ends of a line L, then length of the line &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; will become &lt;math&gt;d/(r_1 r_2)&lt;/math&gt; under an inversion with centre O. The invariant is:

:&lt;math&gt; I =\frac{|x-y| |w-z|}{|x-w| |y-z|}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to Erlangen program==
According to Coxeter,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|pp=77&amp;ndash;95}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transformation by inversion in circle was invented by [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus|L. I. Magnus]] in 1831. Since then this mapping has become an avenue to higher mathematics. Through some steps of application of the circle inversion map, a student of [[transformation geometry]] soon appreciates the significance of [[Felix Klein]]’s [[Erlangen program]], an outgrowth of certain models of [[hyperbolic geometry]]

===Dilations===
The combination of two inversions in concentric circles results in a [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]], [[homothetic transformation]], or dilation characterized by the ratio of the circle radii.

:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto R^2 \frac {x} {|x|^2} = y \mapsto T^2 \frac {y} {|y|^2} = \left( \frac {T} {R} \right)^2 x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Reciprocation===
When a point in the plane is interpreted as a [[complex number]] &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy,&lt;/math&gt; with [[complex conjugate]] &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}=x-iy,&lt;/math&gt; then the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of ''z'' is 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z} = \frac{\bar{z}}{|z|^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the algebraic form of the inversion in a unit circle is given by &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto w&lt;/math&gt; where:

: &lt;math&gt;w=\frac{1}{\bar z}=\overline{\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Reciprocation is key in transformation theory as a [[generating set of a group|generator]] of the [[Möbius group]]. The other generators are translation and rotation, both familiar through physical manipulations in the ambient 3-space. Introduction of reciprocation (dependent upon circle inversion) is what produces the peculiar nature of Möbius geometry, which is sometimes identified with inversive geometry (of the Euclidean plane). However, inversive geometry is the larger study since it includes the raw inversion in a circle (not yet made, with conjugation, into reciprocation). Inversive geometry also includes the [[complex conjugation|conjugation]] mapping. Neither conjugation nor inversion-in-a-circle are in the Möbius group since they are non-conformal (see below). Möbius group elements are [[analytic function]]s of the whole plane and so are necessarily [[conformal map|conformal]].

=== Transforming circles into circles ===
Consider, in the complex plane, the circle of radius &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt; around the point &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(z-a)(z-a)^* = r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where without loss of generality, &lt;math&gt;a \in \R.&lt;/math&gt; Using the definition of inversion

:&lt;math&gt; w = \frac{1}{z^*} &lt;/math&gt;

it is straightforward to show that &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; obeys the equation

:&lt;math&gt;w w^*-\frac{a}{(a^{2}-r^{2})}(w+w^{*})+\frac{a^{2}}{(a^{2}-r^{2})^{2}}=\frac{r^{2}}{(a^{2}-r^{2})^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Showing that the &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; describes the circle of center &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{(a^2-r^2)}&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt; \frac{r}{|a^2-r^2|} &lt;/math&gt;.

when &lt;math&gt;a\to r,&lt;/math&gt; the circle transforms into the line parallel to the imaginary axis &lt;math&gt; w+w^* = \tfrac{1}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Higher geometry===
As mentioned above, zero, the origin, requires special consideration in the circle inversion mapping. The approach is to adjoin a point at infinity designated ∞ or 1/0 . In the complex number approach, where reciprocation is the apparent operation, this procedure leads to the [[complex projective line]], often called the Riemann sphere. It was subspaces and subgroups of this space and group of mappings that were applied to produce early models of hyperbolic geometry by Beltrami, Cayley, and Klein. Thus inversive geometry includes the ideas originated by [[Lobachevsky]] and [[Bolyai]] in their plane geometry. Furthermore, Felix Klein was so overcome by this facility of mappings to identify geometrical phenomena that he delivered a manifesto, the [[Erlangen program]], in 1872. Since then many mathematicians reserve the term ''geometry'' for a [[space (mathematics)|space]] together with a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of mappings of that space. The significant properties of figures in the geometry are those that are invariant under this group.

For example, Smogorzhevsky&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Smogorzhevsky (1982) ''Lobachevskian Geometry'', [[Mir Publishers]], Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; develops several theorems of inversive geometry before beginning Lobachevskian geometry.

==Inversion in higher dimensions==
In ''n''-dimensional space where there is a sphere of radius ''r'', '''inversion in the sphere''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\mapsto \frac{r^2 x_i}{\sum_j x_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation by inversion in [[hyperplane]]s or [[hypersphere]]s in E&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be used to generate dilations, translations, or rotations. Indeed, two concentric hyperspheres, used to produce successive inversions, result in a [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]] or [[contraction mapping|contraction]] on the hyperspheres' center. Such a mapping is called a [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]].

When two parallel hyperplanes are used to produce successive reflections, the result is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]. When two hyperplanes intersect in an (''n''–2)-[[flat (geometry)|flat]], successive reflections produce a [[rotation]] where every point of the (''n''–2)-flat is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of each reflection and thus of the composition.

All of these are [[conformal map]]s, and in fact, where the space has three or more dimensions, the mappings generated by inversion are the only conformal mappings. [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] is a classical theorem of [[conformal geometry]].

The addition of a [[point at infinity]] to the space obviates the distinction between hyperplane and hypersphere; higher dimensional inversive geometry is frequently studied then in the presumed context of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] as the base space. The transformations of inversive geometry are often referred to as [[Möbius transformation#Higher dimensions|Möbius transformations]]. Inversive geometry has been applied to the study of colorings, or partitionings, of an ''n''-sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Joel C. Gibbons &amp; Yushen Luo (2013) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5351v1.pdf Colorings of the ''n''-sphere and inversive geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticonformal mapping property==
The circle inversion map is anticonformal, which means that at every point it preserves angles and reverses orientation  (a map is called [[conformal map|conformal]] if it preserves ''oriented'' angles). Algebraically, a map is anticonformal if at every point the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] is a scalar times an [[orthogonal matrix]] with negative determinant: in two dimensions the Jacobian must be a scalar times a reflection at every point. This means that if ''J'' is the Jacobian, then &lt;math&gt;J \cdot J^T = k I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\det(J) = -\sqrt{k}.&lt;/math&gt; Computing the Jacobian in the case {{nowrap|1=''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/{{norm|'''x'''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{nowrap|1={{norm|'''x'''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives {{nowrap|1=''JJ''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''kI''}}, with {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1/{{norm|'''x'''}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and additionally det(''J'') is negative; hence the inversive map is anticonformal.

In the complex plane, the most obvious circle inversion map  (i.e., using the unit circle centered at the origin) is the complex conjugate of the complex inverse map taking ''z'' to 1/''z''. The complex analytic inverse map is conformal and its conjugate, circle inversion, is anticonformal.
In this case a [[homography]] is conformal while an [[anti-homography]] is anticonformal.

==Inversive geometry and hyperbolic geometry==

The [[hypersphere|(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere]] with equation

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 + 2a_1x_1 + \cdots + 2a_nx_n + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

will have a positive radius if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than ''c'', and on inversion gives the sphere

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 + 2\frac{a_1}{c}x_1 + \cdots + 2\frac{a_n}{c}x_n + \frac{1}{c} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, it will be invariant under inversion if and only if ''c'' = 1. But this is the condition of being orthogonal to the unit sphere. Hence we are led to consider the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-spheres with equation

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 + 2a_1x_1 + \cdots + 2a_nx_n + 1 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which are invariant under inversion, orthogonal to the unit sphere, and have centers outside of the sphere. These together with the subspace hyperplanes separating hemispheres are the hypersurfaces of the [[Poincaré disc model]] of hyperbolic geometry.

Since inversion in the unit sphere leaves the spheres orthogonal to it invariant, the inversion maps the points inside the unit sphere to the outside and vice versa. This is therefore true in general of orthogonal spheres, and in particular inversion in one of the spheres orthogonal to the unit sphere maps the unit sphere to itself. It also maps the interior of the unit sphere to itself, with points outside the orthogonal sphere mapping inside, and vice versa; this defines the reflections of the Poincaré disc model if we also include with them the reflections through the diameters separating hemispheres of the unit sphere. These reflections generate the group of isometries of the model, which tells us that the isometries are conformal. Hence, the angle between two curves in the model is the same as the angle between two curves in the hyperbolic space.

'''Joachim "Jim" Lambek''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (5 December 1922 – 23 June 2014){{r|obit}} was Peter Redpath [[Emeritus]] Professor of Pure Mathematics at [[McGill University]], where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1950 with [[Hans Zassenhaus]] as advisor.

== Biography ==
Lambek was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], where he attended a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref name=scimeeting&gt;{{cite conference|date=2 December 2014|conference=Faculty of Science: Meeting of Faculty|location=Montreal|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/science/files/science/facultyagendadocuments-december_2_2014-_one_file_combined_0.pdf|title=Resolution on the Death of Emeritus Professor Joachim (Jim) Lambek, Department of Mathematics and Statistics|first=Henri|last=Darmon|author-link=Henri Darmon|publisher=[[McGill University]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to England in 1938 as a [[refugee]] on the ''[[Kindertransport]]''.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/montrealgazette/obituary.aspx?n=joachim-lambek&amp;pid=171513640&amp;fhid=14715|title=Joachim Lambek|date=27 June 2014|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Legacy.com|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he was interned as an [[enemy alien]] and deported to a [[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Canada|prison work camp]] in [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. There, he began in his spare time a mathematical apprenticeship with Fritz Rothberger, also
interned, and wrote the [[Matriculation examination|McGill Junior Matriculation]] in fall of 1941.{{r|scimeeting}} In the spring of 1942, he was released and settled in [[Montreal]], where he entered studies at McGill University, graduating with an [[Honours degree|honours]] mathematics degree in 1945 and an [[M.Sc.]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=18|editor1-first=Folkert|editor1-last=Müller-Hoissen|editor2-first=Jean Marcel|editor2-last=Pallo|editor3-first=Jim|editor3-last=Stasheff|title=Associahedra, Tamari Lattices and Related Structures|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-0348-0404-2|doi=10.1007/978-3-0348-0405-9|lccn=2012942603|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he completed his doctorate under [[Hans Zassenhaus]] (becoming McGill's first [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics) and was promoted to assistant professor.{{r|scimeeting}} He was made a full professor in 1963.

Lambek spent his sabbatical year 1965–66 in at the [[Institute for Mathematical Research]] at [[ETH Zurich]], where [[Beno Eckmann]] had gathered together a group of researchers interested in [[algebraic topology]] and [[category theory]], including [[Bill Lawvere]]. There Lambek reoriented his research into category theory.&lt;ref name=lambekfest&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/lambek97/Lambek.biography.html|first=Michael|last=Barr|author-link=Michael Barr (mathematician)|title=An appreciation of Jim Lambek at McGill|date=5 December 1997|conference=LambekFest|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he retired in 1992, Lambek's presence in the [[Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University|Mathematics Department]] was constant until the year before his death.{{r|scimeeting}}

== Scholarly work ==
Lambek supervised 16 doctoral students, and has 51 doctoral descendants. He has over 100 publications listed in the [[Mathematical Reviews]], including 6 books.  His earlier work was mostly in [[module theory]], especially torsion theories, non-commutative localization, and [[injective module]]s.  One of his earliest papers, {{harvtxt|Lambek|Moser|1954}}, proved the [[Lambek-Moser theorem]] about integer sequences.  His more recent work is in [[pregroup]]s and formal languages; his earliest work in this field were probably {{harvtxt|Lambek|1958}} and {{harvtxt|Lambek|1979}}. He is noted, among other things, for the [[Lambek calculus]], an effort to capture mathematical aspects of natural language syntax in [[logical form]] and a work that has been very influential in [[computational linguistics]], as well as for developing the connections between [[simply typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculus]] and [[cartesian closed categories]] (see [[Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence]]). His last works were on [[pregroup grammar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2931">In [[probability theory]], '''Lévy’s continuity theorem''' (or '''Lévy's convergence theorem'''&lt;ref name=W&gt;Williams (1991, section 18.1)&lt;/ref&gt;), named after the French [[mathematician]] [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], connects [[convergence in distribution]] of the sequence of random variables with [[pointwise convergence]] of their [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]]. 
This theorem is the basis for one approach to prove the [[central limit theorem]] and it is one of the major theorems concerning characteristic functions.

==Theorem==

Suppose we have
{{unordered list
|1= a sequence of [[random variable]]s &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily sharing a common [[probability space]],
|2= the sequence of corresponding [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]s &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{\varphi_n\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which by definition are 
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(t) = \operatorname{E}\, e^{itX_n} \quad \forall t\in\mathbb{R},\ \forall n\in\mathbb{N},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]] operator.
}}

If the sequence of characteristic functions [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to some function ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(t)\to\varphi(t) \quad \forall t\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;
then the following statements become equivalent:
{{unordered list
|1= &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; [[Convergence of random variables#Convergence in distribution|converges in distribution]] to some [[random variable]] ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;X_n\ \xrightarrow{\mathcal D}\ X,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the cumulative distribution functions corresponding to random variables converge at every continuity point;
|2= &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is [[Tightness of measures|tight]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\left( \sup_n \operatorname{P}\big[\, |X_n|&gt;x \,\big]\right) = 0;&lt;/math&gt;
|3= ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)&lt;/math&gt;'' is a characteristic function of some random variable ''X'';
|4= ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)&lt;/math&gt;'' is a [[continuous function]] of ''t'';
|5= ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)&lt;/math&gt;'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
}}

== Proof ==
Rigorous proofs of this theorem are available.&lt;ref name=W/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fristedt &amp; Gray (1996, Theorems 14.15 and 18.21)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">[[File:Manhattan Plot.png|thumb|300px|An illustration of a Manhattan plot depicting several strongly associated risk loci]]
A '''Manhattan plot''' is a type of [[scatter plot]], usually used to display data with a large number of data-points - many of non-zero amplitude, and with a distribution of higher-magnitude values, for instance in [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS).&lt;ref name=East&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20581876|doi=10.1038/ng0710-558|year=2010|last1=Gibson|first1=Greg|title=Hints of hidden heritability in GWAS |volume=42|pages=558–560|journal=Nature Genetics|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GWAS Manhattan plots, genomic coordinates are displayed along the X-axis, with the negative [[logarithm]] of the association [[p-value|''P''-value]] for each [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) displayed on the Y-axis, meaning that each dot on the Manhattan plot signifies a SNP. Because the strongest associations have the smallest ''P''-values (e.g., 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;), their negative logarithms will be the greatest (e.g., 15).

It gains its name from the similarity of such a plot to the [[Manhattan]] [[skyline]]: a profile of [[skyscrapers]] towering above the lower level "buildings" which vary around a lower height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18510">The '''material point method''' ('''MPM''') is a numerical technique used to simulate the behavior of [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es, and any other [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] material. Especially, it is a robust spatial discretization method for simulating multi-phase (solid-fluid-gas) interactions. In the MPM, a continuum body is described by a number of small [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] elements referred to as 'material points'. These material points are surrounded by a background mesh/grid that is used only to calculate gradient terms such as the deformation gradient. Unlike other mesh-based methods like the [[finite element method]], [[finite volume method]] or [[finite difference method]], the MPM is '''not''' a mesh based method and is instead categorized as a meshless/meshfree or continuum-based particle method, examples of which are [[Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics|smoothed particle hydrodynamics]] and [[peridynamics]]. Despite the presence of a background mesh, the MPM does not encounter the drawbacks of mesh-based methods (high deformation tangling, advection errors etc.) which makes it a promising and powerful tool in [[computational mechanics]].

The MPM was originally proposed, as an extension of a similar method known as [[Particle-in-cell|FLIP]] (a further extension of a method called [[Particle-in-cell|PIC]]) to computational solid dynamics, in the early 1990 by Professors [[Deborah L. Sulsky]], Zhen Chen and Howard L. Schreyer at University of New Mexico. After this initial development, the MPM has been further developed both in the national labs as well as the [[University of New Mexico]], [[Oregon State University]], [[University of Utah]] and more across the US and the world. Recently the number of institutions researching the MPM has been growing with added popularity and awareness coming from various sources such as the MPM's use in the Disney film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.

== The algorithm ==
An MPM simulation consists of the following stages:

''(Prior to the time integration phase)''
# '''&lt;u&gt;Initialization of grid and material points.&lt;/u&gt;'''
## A geometry is discretized into a collection of material points, each with its own material properties and initial conditions (velocity, stress, temperature, etc.)
## The grid, being only used to provide a place for gradient calculations is normally made to cover an area large enough to fill the expected extent of computational domain needed for the simulation.

==History of PIC/MPM==

The PIC was originally conceived to solve problems in fluid dynamics, and developed by [[Francis H. Harlow|Harlow]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, N.L. "The legacy and future of computational fluid dynamics at Los Alamos". In Proceedings of the 1996 Canadian CFD Conference, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first PIC codes was the Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) program, which was created by Brackbill in 1986&lt;ref name="Brackbill"&gt;Brackbill, J.U. and Ruppel, H.M. "FLIP: A method for adaptively zoned, particle-in-cell calculations in two dimensions". Journal of Computational Physics, 65, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and has been constantly in development ever since. Until the 1990s, the PIC method was used principally in fluid dynamics.

Motivated by the need for better simulating penetration problems in solid dynamics, Sulsky, Chen and Schreyer started in 1993 to reformulate the PIC and develop the MPM, with funding from Sandia National Laboratories.&lt;ref name="Sulsky"&gt;Sulsky, D., Chen, Z., and Schreyer, H.L. "A particle method for history-dependent materials". Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 118:179–196, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The original MPM was then further extended by Bardenhagen ''et al.''. to include frictional contact,&lt;ref name="Bardenhagen"&gt;Bardenhagen, S.G., Brackbill, J.U., and Sulsky, D. "Shear deformation in granular materials". 1998&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled the simulation of granular flow,&lt;ref name="Wieckowski"&gt;Wieckowski, Z. "A particle-in-cell method in analysis of motion of a granular material in a silo". Computational Mechanics: New trends and Applications, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and by Nairn to include explicit cracks&lt;ref name="Nairn"&gt;Nairn, J. A. "Material Point Method Calculations with Explicit Cracks". Computer Modeling in Engineering &amp; Science, 4:649–664, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and crack propagation (known as CRAMP).

Recently, an MPM implementation based on a micro-polar Cosserat continuum &lt;ref name=Coetzee&gt;Coetzee, C.J. The modelling of granular flow using the particle-in-cell method. PhD thesis, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; has been used to simulate high-shear granular flow, such as silo discharge. MPM's uses were further extended into [[Geotechnical engineering]] with the recent development of a quasi-static, implicit MPM solver which provides numerically stable analyses of large-deformation problems in [[Soil mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Beuth"&gt;Beuth, L., Coetzee, C.J., Bonnier, P. and van den Berg, P. "Formulation and validation of a quasi-static material point method." In 10th International Symposium on Numerical Methods in Geomechanics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual workshops on the use of MPM are held at various locations in the United States. The Fifth MPM Workshop was held at [[Oregon State University]], in [[Corvallis, OR]], on April 2 and 3, 2009.

==Applications of PIC/MPM==

The uses of the PIC or MPM method can be divided into two broad categories: firstly, there are many applications involving fluid dynamics, plasma physics, magnetohydrodynamics, and multiphase applications. The second category of applications comprises problems in solid mechanics.

===Fluid dynamics and multiphase simulations===
The PIC method has been used to simulate a wide range of fluid-solid interactions, including sea ice dynamics,&lt;ref name="Ligett"&gt;Ligett, K. "A modified particle-in-cell method for sea ice dynamics". Clarkson University Technical Report, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; penetration of biological soft tissues,&lt;ref name="Ionescu"&gt;Ionescu, I., Guilkey, J., Berzins, M., Kirby, R., and Weiss, J. "Computational simulation of penetrating trauma in biological soft tissues using MPM."&lt;/ref&gt; fragmentation of gas-filled canisters,&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;Banerjee, B. "Material point method simulations of fragmenting cylinders". In 17th ASCE Engineering Mechanics Conference, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; dispersion of atmospheric pollutants,&lt;ref name="Patankar"&gt;Patankar,N.A. and Joseph, D.D. "Lagrangian numerical simulation of particulate flows". International Journal of Multiphase Flows, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; multiscale simulations coupling molecular dynamics with MPM,&lt;ref name="Lu"&gt;Lu, H., Daphalapurkar, N. P., Wang, B., Roy, S., Komanduri, R. "Multiscale Simulation from atomistic to continuum -- coupling molecular dynamics (MD) with material point method (MPM)." Philosophical Magazine. 86(20):2971–2994, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;Ma., J. "Multiscale Simulation using the Generalized Interpolation MPM, Discrete Dislocations and Molecular Dynamics." PhD thesis, Oklahoma State University, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and fluid-membrane interactions.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;York, A., Sulsky, D. and Schreyer, H. "Fluid-membrane interaction based on the material point method." International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the PIC-based FLIP code has been applied in magnetohydrodynamics and plasma processing tools, and simulations in astrophysics and free-surface flow.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, S. and Liu, W.K. "Meshfree and particle methods and their applications". American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a joint effort between UCLA's mathematics department and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], MPM was successfully used to simulate [[snow]] in the 2013 computer-animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marquez |first=Letisia |title=UCLA's mathematicians bring snow to life for Disney's "Frozen" |url=http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/math-wizards-create-snow-for-disney-263913.aspx |accessdate=6 March 2014 |newspaper=UCLA Today |date=February 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310163207/http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/math-wizards-create-snow-for-disney-263913.aspx |archivedate=10 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A material point method for snow simulation |url=https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/72/asset/snow.pdf |publisher=[[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] |accessdate=6 March 2014 |author1=Alexey Stomakhin |author2=Craig Schroeder |author3=Lawrence Chai |author4=Joseph Teran |author5=Andrew Selle |date=August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401000000/https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/72/asset/snow.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgmeetup"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jason|title=Making of Disney's Frozen: A Material Point Method For Snow Simulation|url=http://www.cgmeetup.net/home/making-of-disneys-frozen-snow-simulation/|accessdate=18 January 2014|newspaper=CG Meetup|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid mechanics===
MPM has also been used extensively in solid mechanics, to simulate impact, penetration, collision and rebound, as well as crack propagation.&lt;ref name="Karuppiah"&gt;Karuppiah, V. "Implementation of irregular mesh in MPM for simulation of mixed mode crack opening in tension." Master’s thesis, Oklahoma State University, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daphalapurkar"&gt;Daphalapurkar, N. P., Lu, H., Coker, D., Komanduri, R. "Simulation of dynamic crack growth using the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method." International Journal of Fracture. 143:79–102, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; MPM has also become a widely used method within the field of soil mechanics: it has been used to simulate granular flow, silo discharge, pile driving, bucket filling, and material failure; and to model soil stress distribution, compaction, and hardening. It is now being used in wood mechanics problems such as simulations of transverse compression on the cellular level including cell wall contact &lt;ref name="Nairn2"&gt;Nairn, J. A. "Numerical Simulations of Transverse Compression and Densification in Wood". Wood and Fiber Science. 38:576–591, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (this work received the George Marra Award for paper of the year from the Society of Wood Science and Technology [https://web.archive.org/web/20070923193216/http://www.swst.org/marrarecip.html])

==Classification of PIC/MPM codes==

===MPM in the context of numerical methods===

One subset of numerical methods are [[Meshfree methods]], which are defined as methods for which "a predefined mesh is not necessary, at least in field variable interpolation". Ideally, a meshfree method does not make use of a mesh "throughout the process of solving the problem governed by partial differential equations, on a given arbitrary domain, subject to all kinds of boundary conditions," although existing methods are not ideal and fail in at least one of these respects. Meshless methods, which are also sometimes called particle methods, share a "common feature that the history of state variables is traced at points (particles) which are not connected with any element mesh, the distortion of which is a source of numerical difficulties." As can be seen by these varying interpretations, some scientists consider MPM to be a meshless method, while others do not. All agree, however, that MPM is a particle method.

The [[Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian]] (ALE) methods form another subset of numerical methods which includes MPM. Purely [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|''Lagrangian'']] methods employ a framework in which a space is discretised into initial subvolumes, whose flowpaths are then charted over time. Purely [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|''Eulerian'']] methods, on the other hand, employ a framework in which the motion of material is described relative to a mesh that remains fixed in space throughout the calculation. As the name indicates, ALE methods combine Lagrangian and Eulerian frames of reference.

===Subclassification of MPM/PIC===
PIC methods may be based on either the strong form collocation or a weak form discretisation of the underlying [[partial differential equation]] (PDE). Those based on the strong form are properly referred to as finite-volume PIC methods. Those based on the weak form discretisation of PDEs may be called either PIC or MPM.

MPM solvers can model problems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions, and can also model [[axisymmetric]] problems. MPM can be implemented to solve either quasi-static or dynamic [[equations of motion]], depending on the type of problem that is to be modeled.

The time-integration used for MPM may be either [[explicit and implicit methods|''explicit'']] or [[explicit and implicit methods|''implicit'']]. The advantage to implicit integration is guaranteed stability, even for large timesteps. On the other hand, explicit integration runs much faster and is easier to implement.

==Advantages==

===Compared to FEM===
Unlike [[finite element method|''FEM'']], MPM does not require periodical remeshing steps and remapping of state variables, and is therefore better suited to the modeling of large material deformations. In MPM, particles and not the mesh points store all the information on the state of the calculation. Therefore, no numerical error results from the mesh returning to its original position after each calculation cycle, and no remeshing algorithm is required.

The particle basis of MPM allows it to treat crack propagation and other discontinuities better than FEM, which is known to impose the mesh orientation on crack propagation in a material. Also, particle methods are better at handling history-dependent constitutive models.

===Compared to pure particle methods===
Because in MPM nodes remain fixed on a regular grid, the calculation of gradients is trivial.

In simulations with two or more phases it is rather easy to detect contact between entities, as particles can interact via the grid with other particles in the same body, with other solid bodies, and with fluids.

==Disadvantages of MPM==

MPM is more expensive in terms of storage than other methods, as MPM makes use of mesh as well as particle data. MPM is more computationally expensive than FEM, as the grid must be reset at the end of each MPM calculation step and reinitialised at the beginning of the following step. Spurious oscillation may occur as particles cross the boundaries of the mesh in MPM, although this effect can be minimized by using generalized interpolation methods (GIMP). In MPM as in FEM, the size and orientation of the mesh can impact the results of a calculation: for example, in MPM, strain localisation is known to be particularly sensitive to mesh refinement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1573">In [[real analysis]], a branch of mathematics, a '''modulus of convergence''' is a function that tells how quickly a [[convergent sequence]] converges.  These moduli are often employed in the study of [[computable analysis]] and [[constructive mathematics]]. 

If a sequence of real numbers (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges to a real number ''x'', then by definition for every real ε &gt; 0 there is a natural number ''N'' such that if ''i'' &gt; ''N'' then |''x'' &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε. A modulus of convergence is essentially a function that, given ε, returns a corresponding value of ''N''.

== Definition ==

Suppose that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a convergent sequence of real numbers with limit ''x''. There are two ways of defining a modulus of convergence as a function from natural numbers to natural numbers:
* As a function ''f''(''n'') such that for all ''n'', if ''i'' &gt; ''f''(''n'') then |''x'' &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; 1/''n''
* As a function ''g''(''n'') such that for all ''n'', if ''i'' ≥ ''j'' &gt; ''g''(''n'') then |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; 1/''n''
The latter definition is often employed in constructive settings, where the limit ''x'' may actually be identified with the convergent sequence. Some authors use an alternate definition that replaces 1/''n'' with 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19188">In the mathematical field of [[real analysis]], the '''monotone convergence theorem''' is any of a number of related theorems proving the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of [[monotonic sequence]]s (sequences that are [[increasing]] or [[decreasing]]) that are also [[Bounded function|bounded]]. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a [[supremum]], then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an [[infimum]], it will converge to the infimum.

==Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers==

===Lemma 1===
If a sequence of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its [[supremum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be such a sequence. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and bounded above. By the [[least-upper-bound property]] of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;c = \sup_n \{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is finite. Now, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_N &gt; c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;, since otherwise &lt;math&gt;c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts to the definition of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is increasing, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is its upper bound, for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|c - a_n| \leq |c - a_N| &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by definition, the limit of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sup_n \{a_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lemma 2===
If a sequence of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its [[infimum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
The proof is similar to the proof for the case when the sequence is increasing and bounded above,

===Theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is a monotone [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s (i.e., if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1 or ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1), then this sequence has a finite limit if and only if the sequence is [[bounded sequence|bounded]].&lt;ref&gt;A generalisation of this theorem was given by {{cite journal |first=John |last=Bibby |year=1974 |title=Axiomatisations of the average and a further generalisation of monotonic sequences |journal=[[Glasgow Mathematical Journal]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=63–65 |doi=10.1017/S0017089500002135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof===
* "If"-direction: The proof follows directly from the lemmas.
* "Only If"-direction: By [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|definition of limit]], every sequence &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with a finite limit &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily bounded.

==Convergence of a monotone series==

===Theorem===
If for all natural numbers ''j'' and ''k'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-negative real number and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1,''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, then&lt;ref&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=J. |last=Yeh |title=Real Analysis: Theory of Measure and Integration |location=Hackensack, NJ |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 |isbn=981-256-653-8 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j\to\infty} \sum_k a_{j,k} = \sum_k \lim_{j\to\infty} a_{j,k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that
#the columns are weakly increasing and bounded, and
#for each row, the [[series (mathematics)|series]] whose terms are given by this row has a convergent sum,
then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term ''k'' is given by the limit of column ''k'' (which is also its [[supremum]]). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent.

As an example, consider the infinite series of rows

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1+ \frac1 n\right)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk/n^k = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac1{k!} \times \frac nn \times \frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' approaches infinity (the limit of this series is [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]). Here the matrix entry in row ''n'' and column ''k'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk/n^k=\frac1{k!}\times\frac nn\times\frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n;&lt;/math&gt;

the columns (fixed ''k'') are indeed weakly increasing with ''n'' and bounded (by 1/''k''!), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums &lt;math&gt;(1+1/n)^n&lt;/math&gt; by taking the sum of the column limits, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac1{k!}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem for Lebesgue integral==
The following result is due to [[Beppo Levi]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]]. In what follows, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of Borel sets on &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; contains the set &lt;math&gt;\{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; and all Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R_{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]], and &lt;math&gt;X\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a pointwise non-decreasing sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}^\infty_{k=1}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-[[Measurable function|measurable]] non-negative functions &lt;math&gt;f_k:X\to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for every &lt;math&gt;{k\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq f_k(x) \leq f_{k+1}(x)\leq\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Set the pointwise limit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for every  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; f(x):= \lim_{k\to\infty} f_k(x). &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable and

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_X f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark 1.''' The integrals may be finite or infinite.

'''Remark 2.''' The theorem remains true if its assumptions hold &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a [[null set]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; non-decreases for every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X\setminus N}.&lt;/math&gt; To see why this is true, we start with an observation that allowing the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ f_n \}&lt;/math&gt; to pointwise non-decrease almost everywhere causes its pointwise limit &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be undefined on some null set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. On that null set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may then be defined arbitrarily, e.g. as zero, or in any other way that preserves measurability. To see why this will not affect the outcome of the theorem, note that since &lt;math&gt;{\mu(N)=0},&lt;/math&gt; we have, for every &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_X f \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f \,d\mu, &lt;/math&gt;

provided that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=Erik |last=Schechter |title=Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-12-622760-8 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.38}} (These equalities follow directly from the definition of Lebesgue integral for a non-negative function).

'''Remark 3.''' Under assumptions of the theorem,
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) = \liminf_k f_k(x) = \limsup_k f_k(x) = \sup_k f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \textstyle \limsup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \sup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
}}

(Note that the second chain of equalities follows from Remark 5).

'''Remark 4.''' The proof below does not use any properties of Lebesgue integral except those established here. The theorem, thus, can be used to prove other basic properties, such as linearity, pertaining to Lebesgue integration.

'''Remark 5 (monotonicity of Lebesgue integral).''' In the proof below, we apply the monotonic property of Lebesgue integral to non-negative functions only. Specifically (see Remark 4), let the functions &lt;math&gt;f,g : X \to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.

*If &lt;math&gt;f \leq g&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu \leq \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

*If &lt;math&gt; X_1,X_2 \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_1 \subseteq X_2, &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X_1} f\,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.''' Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(h)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq h&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt; 

'''1.''' Since &lt;math&gt;f \leq g,&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SF}(f) \subseteq \operatorname{SF}(g). &lt;/math&gt;

By definition of Lebesgue integral and the properties of supremum,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu = \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu \leq \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(g)}\int_X s\,d\mu = \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{X_1}&lt;/math&gt; be the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; It can be deduced from the definition of Lebesgue integral that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu = \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

if we notice that, for every &lt;math&gt;s \in {\rm SF}(f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; outside of &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; Combined with the previous property, the inequality &lt;math&gt; f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \leq f&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu = \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
This proof does ''not'' rely on [[Fatou's lemma]]. However, we do explain how that lemma might be used.

For those not interested in independent proof, the intermediate results below may be skipped.
====Intermediate results====
=====Lebesgue integral as measure=====
'''Lemma 1.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a measurable space. Consider a simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s:\Omega\to{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt;. For a subset &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(S)=\int_Ss\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

======Proof======
Monotonicity follows from Remark 5. Here, we will only prove countable additivity, leaving the rest up to the reader. Let &lt;math&gt;S=\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint. Due to simplicity,
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
for some finite non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in{\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; and pairwise disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\cup^n_{i=1}A_i=\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By definition of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nu(S)&amp;=\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu(S\cap A_i)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl((\cup^\infty_{j=1}S_j)\cap A_i\bigr)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_j\cap A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, the countable additivity of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;
gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i).
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the summands are non-negative, the sum of the series, whether this sum is finite or infinite, cannot change if summation order does. For that reason,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i)&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot
\mu(S_j\cap A_i)\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\int_{S_j} s\,d\mu\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\nu(S_j),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

====="Continuity from below"=====
The following property is a direct consequence of the definition of measure.

'''Lemma 2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a measure, and &lt;math&gt;S=
\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
S_1\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S_i\subseteq S_{i+1}\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S
&lt;/math&gt;
is a non-decreasing chain with all its sets &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-measurable. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\lim_i\mu(S_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof of theorem====
'''Step 1.''' We begin by showing that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; (\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}) &lt;/math&gt;–measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"/&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.3}}

'''Note.''' If we were using Fatou's lemma, the measurability would follow easily from Remark 3(a).

To do this ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[Sigma-algebra|sigma-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, because (closed) intervals generate the [[Borel sigma algebra]] on the reals. Since &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; is a closed interval, and, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\le f_k(x) \le f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;0\leq f(x)\leq t\quad \Leftrightarrow\quad \Bigl[\forall k\quad 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\Bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in X \mid 0\leq f(x)\leq t\} = \bigcap_k \{x\in X \mid 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Being the inverse image of a [[Borel set]] under a &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, each set in the countable intersection is an element of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras are, by definition, closed under countable intersections, this shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable, and the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_X f \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt; is well defined (and possibly infinite).

'''Step 2.''' We will first show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_X f \,d\mu \geq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

The definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}&lt;/math&gt; imply that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. By monotonicity (or, more precisely, its narrower version established in Remark 5; see also Remark 4) of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\int_X f_k\,d\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the limit on the right exists (finite or infinite) because, due to monotonicity (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), the sequence is non-decreasing.

'''End of Step 2.'''

We now prove the reverse inequality. We seek to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof using Fatou's lemma.''' Per Remark 3, the inequality we want to prove is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \liminf_k f_k(x) \,d\mu \leq \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
But the latter follows immediately from Fatou's lemma, and the proof is complete.

'''Independent proof.''' To prove the inequality ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, we need some extra machinery. Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3.''' Given a simple function &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;t\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\{x\in X\mid t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)\}\subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\subseteq B^{s,t}_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3a.''' To prove the first claim, let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle s=\sum^m_{i=1}c_i\cdot{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;, for some finite collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\cup^m_{i=1}A_i&lt;/math&gt;, some (finite) non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in {\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; denoting the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For every &lt;math&gt; x\in A_i, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; f_k(x) \in [t\cdot c_i, +\infty].&lt;/math&gt; Given that the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint,

:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\bigcup^m_{i=1}\Bigl(f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)\cap A_i\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the pre-image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt; of the Borel set
&lt;math&gt;[t\cdot c_i,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; under the measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is measurable, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, by definition, are closed under finite intersection and unions, the first claim follows.

'''Step 3b.''' To prove the second claim, note that, for each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_k(x)\leq f_{k+1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3c.''' To prove the third claim, we show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, if, to the contrary, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\not\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, then an element
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_0\in X\setminus\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k=\bigcap_k(X\setminus B^{s,t}_k)&lt;/math&gt;
exists such that &lt;math&gt;f_k(x_0)&lt;t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_0)\leq t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
But by initial assumption, &lt;math&gt;s\leq f&lt;/math&gt;. This is a contradiction.

'''Step 4.''' For every simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
To prove this, define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\nu(S)=\int_S s_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 1, &lt;math&gt;\nu(S)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By "continuity from below" (Lemma 2),
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\lim_n\nu(B^{s,t}_n)=\nu(X)=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 5.''' We now prove that, for every &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, using the definition of &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of Lebesgue integral (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), we have
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B^{s,t}_k}t\cdot s\,d\mu\leq\int_{B^{s,t}_k} f_k\,d\mu\leq\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
for every &lt;math&gt;k\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. In accordance with Step 4, as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality becomes
:&lt;math&gt;t\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;t\uparrow 1&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 6.''' We are now able to prove the reverse inequality, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, by non-negativity, &lt;math&gt;f_+ = f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_- = 0.&lt;/math&gt; For the calculation below, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is essential. Applying the definition of Lebesgue integral and the inequality established in Step 5, we have
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu=\sup_{s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
The proof is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">In mathematical set theory, the '''[[multiverse]]''' view is that there are many models of set theory, but no "absolute", "canonical" or "true" model. The various models are all equally valid or true, though some may be more useful or attractive than others. The opposite view is the "universe" view of set theory in which all sets are contained in some single ultimate model. The collection of countable transitive models of ZFC (in some universe) is called the '''hyperverse''' and is very similar to the "multiverse". 

A typical difference between the universe and multiverse views is the attitude to the [[continuum  hypothesis]]. In the universe view the continuum hypothesis is a meaningful question that is either true or false though we have not yet been able to decide which. In the multiverse view it is meaningless  to ask whether the continuum hypothesis is true or false before selecting a model of set theory. Another difference is that the statement "For every transitive model of ZFC there is a larger model of ZFC in which it is countable" is true in some versions of the multiverse view of mathematics but is false in the universe view.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">[[File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|thumb|The [[Sphere|2-sphere]] is usually considered as a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], so its natural topology is inherited from the [[Euclidean topology]].]]
In any domain of [[mathematics]], a space has a '''natural topology''' if there is a [[topology]] on the space which is "best adapted" to its study within the domain in question. In many cases this imprecise definition means little more than the assertion that the topology in question arises ''naturally'' or ''canonically'' (see [[mathematical jargon]]) in the given context.
 
Note that in some cases multiple topologies seem "natural". For example, if ''Y'' is a subset of a [[total order|totally ordered]] set ''X'', then the [[Order_topology#Induced_order_topology|induced order topology]], i.e. the [[order topology]] of the totally ordered ''Y'', where this order is inherited from ''X'', is coarser than the [[subspace topology]] of the order topology of ''X''.

"Natural topology" does quite often have a more specific meaning, at least given some prior contextual information: the natural topology is a topology which makes a natural map or collection of maps [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. This is still imprecise, even once one has specified what the natural maps are, because there may be many topologies with the required property. However, there is often a [[finest topology|finest]] or [[coarsest topology|coarsest]] topology which makes the given maps continuous, in which case these are obvious candidates for ''the'' natural topology.

The simplest cases (which nevertheless cover ''many'' examples) are the [[initial topology]] and the [[final topology]] (Willard (1970)). The initial topology is the coarsest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from ''X'' to topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; continuous. The final topology is the finest topology on a space ''X'' which makes a given collection of maps from topological spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' continuous.

Two of the simplest examples are the natural topologies of subspaces and quotient spaces.
* The natural topology on a [[subset]] of a topological space is the [[subspace topology]]. This is the coarsest topology which makes the [[inclusion map]] continuous.
* The natural topology on a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of a topological space is the [[quotient topology]]. This is the finest topology which makes the [[quotient map]] continuous.

Another example is that any metric space has a natural topology [[Metric_space#Open_and_closed_sets,_topology_and_convergence|induced by its metric]].

The '''Object Management Group''' ('''OMG''') is an international, open membership, not-for-profit computer industry [[standardization|standards]] [[consortium]] with representation from government, industry and academia. OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even wider range of industries. OMG modeling standards enable powerful visual design, execution and maintenance of software and other processes. 

== Overview ==
OMG provides only specifications, and does not provide implementations. But before a specification can be accepted as a standard by OMG, the members of the submitter team must guarantee that they will bring a conforming product to market within a year. This is an attempt to prevent unimplemented (and unimplementable) standards.

Other private companies or open source groups are encouraged to produce conforming products and OMG is attempting to develop mechanisms to enforce true interoperability.

OMG hosts four technical meetings for its members and interested nonmembers. The Technical Meetings provide a neutral forum to discuss, develop and adopt standards that enable software interoperability for a wide range of industries including: business, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, robotics, software-based communications, security, government, space and more. Additionally, OMG holds four technical meetings per year. More information about these meetings can be found on the [https://www.omg.org/events/ events page] of their website.

== History ==
Founded in 1989 by eleven companies (including [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Apple Computer]], [[American Airlines]], iGrafx, and [[Data General]]), OMG's initial focus was to create a heterogeneous [[Distributed computing|distributed]] [[object (computing)|object]] standard.  The founding executive team included Christopher Stone and John Slitz. As of November 2012, the leadership includes Chairman and CEO [[Richard Soley]], President and COO [http://www.omg.org/contacts/hoffman.htm Bill Hoffman] and Vice President and Technical Director Larry L. Johnson. 

Since 2000, OMG international headquarters has been located in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], [[Massachusetts]]. In November 2012, the headquarters was moved from 140 Kendrick St to 109 Highland Ave.

The goal was a common portable and interoperable object model with methods and data that work using all types of development environments on all types of platforms.

In 1997, the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) was added to the list of OMG adopted technologies. UML is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software engineering.

In June 2005, the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI.org) and OMG announced the merger of their respective Business Process Management (BPM) activities to form the Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force (BMI DTF).

In 2006 the [[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN) was adopted as a standard by OMG.

In 2007 the [[Business Motivation Model]] (BMM) was adopted as a standard by the OMG. The BMM is a metamodel that provides a vocabulary for corporate governance and strategic planning and is particularly relevant to businesses undertaking [[governance]], [[regulatory compliance]], [[business transformation]] and [[strategic planning]] activities.

In 2009 OMG, together with the [[Software Engineering Institute]] at [[Carnegie Mellon]], launched the [[CISQ|Consortium of IT Software Quality]] (CISQ). [[CISQ]] brings together industry executives from Global 2000 IT organizations, system integrators, outsourcers, and package vendors to jointly address the challenge of standardizing the measurement of IT software quality and to promote a market-based ecosystem to support its deployment.

In 2011 OMG formed the Cloud Standards Customer Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloud-council.org/ Cloud Standards Customer Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Founding sponsors included [[CA Technologies|CA]], [[IBM]], [[Kaavo]], [[Rackspace]] and [[Software AG]]. The CSCC is an OMG end user advocacy group dedicated to accelerating cloud's successful adoption, and drilling down into the standards, security and interoperability issues surrounding the transition to the cloud. The Council is not a standards organization, but will complement existing cloud standards efforts and establish a core set of client-driven requirements to ensure cloud users will have the same freedom of choice, flexibility, and openness they have with traditional IT environments. CSCC is open to all end-user organizations.

In September 2011, the OMG Board of Directors unanimously voted to adopt the Vector Signal and Image Processing Library (VSIPL) as the latest OMG specification. Work for adopting the specification was led by [[Mentor Graphics]]' Embedded Software Division, RunTime Computing Solutions, The [[Mitre Corporation]] as well as the High Performance Embedded Computing Software Initiative (HPEC-SI). VSIPL is an application programming interface (API) defined by an open standard developed by embedded signal and image processing hardware and software vendors, academia, application developers, and government labs. VSIPL and VSIPL++ contain hundreds of functions used for common signal processing kernel and other computations. These functions include basic arithmetic, trigonometric, transcendental, signal processing, linear algebra, and image processing. The VSIPL family of libraries has been implemented by multiple vendors for a range of processor architectures, including x86, PowerPC, Cell, and NVIDIA GPUs. VSIPL and VSIPL++ are designed to achieve high performance, increase programmer productivity and maintain portability across a range of processor architectures. Additionally, VSIPL++ was designed from the start to include support for parallelism.

Late 2012 early 2013, The Object Management Group Board of Directors adopted the Automated Function Point (AFP) specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2013/01-17-13.htm | title=OMG Adopts Automated Function Point Specification | work=OMG | date=2013-01-17 | accessdate=August 13, 2016 | author=Julie Pike}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push for adoption was led by the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ). AFP provides a standard for automating the popular [[function point]] measure according to the counting guidelines of the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG).

On March 27 2014, OMG announced it would be managing the newly formed Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). An open-membership, not-for-profit, the IIC will take the lead in establishing interoperability across industrial environments for a more connected world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2014/03-27-14.htm | title=OMG to Manage the Industrial Internet Consortium | work=OMG | date=2014-03-27 | accessdate=August 13, 2016 | author=Julie Pike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managed Programs ==
The [[Industrial Internet Consortium|Industrial Internet Consortium®]] (IIC™) is the world’s leading membership program transforming business and society by accelerating the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Its mission is to accelerate growth of the Industrial Internet by coordinating ecosystem initiatives to connect and integrate objects with people, processes and data using common architectures, interoperability and open standards that lead to transformational business outcomes. Launched in 2014 by [[AT&amp;T]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[IBM]] and [[Intel]], the IIC delivers a trustworthy IIoT in which the world’s systems and devices are securely connected and controlled to deliver transformational outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iiconsortium.org/about-us.htm|title=About Us {{!}} Industrial Internet Consortium|website=www.iiconsortium.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   

The [[CISQ|Consortium for IT Software Quality]]™ (CISQ™) is an IT leadership group that develops international standards for automating the measurement of software size and structural quality from the source code. The standards written by CISQ enable IT and business leaders to measure the risk IT applications pose to the business, as well as estimate the cost of ownership. CISQ was co-founded by the Object Management Group and Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://it-cisq.org/cisq-faqs/|title=CISQ FAQs {{!}} CISQ - Consortium for IT Software Quality|website=it-cisq.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More information is available on their [http://it-cisq.org/. website].

== Ratified ISO Standards ==

}}'''Paolo Ruffini''' (September 22, 1765 – May 10, 1822) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]].

By 1788 he had earned university degrees in philosophy, medicine/surgery, and mathematics. Among his work was an [[incomplete  proof]] ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512337/Paolo-Ruffini&lt;/ref&gt;) that [[Quintic equation|quintic (and higher-order) equations]] cannot be solved by [[Nth root|radicals]] (1799&lt;ref&gt;''Teoria Generale delle Equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto.''&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Ruffini's rule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Ruffini}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a quick method for [[polynomial division]]. Ruffini also made contributions to [[group theory]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/periodictable/html/Rf.html&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to [[probability]] and [[quadrature of the circle]].

He practiced as both a professor of mathematics ([[University of Modena]]) and a medical doctor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13220b.htm Paolo Ruffini] --- [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; including scientific work&lt;ref&gt;''Memoria sul tifo contagioso.''&lt;/ref&gt; on [[typhus]].

==Group Theory==
Ruffini’s 1799 work marked a major development for [[group theory]]. Ruffini developed [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]'s work on permutation theory, following 29 years after Lagrange’s "Réflexions sur la théorie algébrique des equations" (1770–1771) which was largely ignored until Ruffini who established strong connections between permutations and the solvability of algebraic equations. Ruffini was the first to controversially assert the unsolvability by radicals of algebraic equations higher than [[quartic function|quartics]]. This angered many members of the community such as [[Gian Francesco Malfatti|Malfatti]] (1731–1807). Work in this area was later carried on by those such as [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] and [[Galois]] who succeeded in such a proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wussing|first1=Hans|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept|date=2007|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486458687|edition=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23069">'''Parrondo's paradox''', a [[paradox]] in [[game theory]], has been described as: ''A combination of losing strategies becomes a winning strategy''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It is named after its creator, [[J. M. R. Parrondo|Juan Parrondo]], who discovered the paradox in 1996. A more explanatory description is:

:''There exist pairs of games, each with a higher probability of losing than winning, for which it is possible to construct a winning strategy by playing the games alternately.''

Parrondo devised the paradox in connection with his analysis of the [[Brownian ratchet]], a [[thought experiment]] about a machine that can purportedly extract energy from random heat motions popularized by physicist [[Richard Feynman]].  However, the paradox disappears when rigorously analyzed.&lt;ref name="ShuParrondo"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Beyond Parrondo’s paradox | journal = Scientific Reports | date = 2014 | first1 = Jian-Jun | last1 = Shu | first2 = Q.-W. | last2 = Wang | volume = 4 | issue = 4244 | pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1038/srep04244 | pmid=24577586}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, problems in evolutionary biology and ecology have been modeled and explained in terms of the paradox&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

[[Image:Parrondo's paradox by Jian-Jun SHU.jpg|thumb|300px|Probability space of Parrondo’s paradox from Shu &amp; Wang, 2014.&lt;ref name="ShuParrondo"/&gt;]]

==Illustrative examples==

===The saw-tooth example===
[[Image:Parrandos Paradox Unbiased Games.PNG|right|thumb|Figure 1]]
Consider an example in which there are two points '''A''' and '''B''' having the same altitude, as shown in Figure 1. In the first case, we have a flat profile connecting them. Here, if we leave some round marbles in the middle that move back and forth in a random fashion, they will roll around randomly but towards both ends with an equal probability. Now consider the second case where we have a saw-tooth-like region between them. Here also, the marbles will roll towards either ends with equal probability (if there were a tendency to move in one direction, marbles in a ring of this shape would tend to spontaneously extract thermal energy to revolve, violating the second law of thermodynamics). Now if we tilt the whole profile towards the right, as shown in Figure 2, it is quite clear that both these cases will become biased towards '''B'''.

Now consider the game in which we alternate the two profiles while judiciously choosing the time between alternating from one profile to the other.
[[Image:Parrandos Paradox Biased Games.PNG|right|thumb|Figure 2]]

When we leave a few marbles on the first profile at point '''E''', they distribute themselves on the plane showing preferential movements towards point '''B'''. However, if we apply the second profile when some of the marbles have crossed the point '''C''', but none have crossed point '''D''', we will end up having most marbles back at point '''E''' (where we started from initially) but some also in the valley towards point '''A''' given sufficient time for the marbles to roll to the valley. Then we again apply the first profile and repeat the steps (points '''C''', '''D''' and '''E''' now shifted one step to refer to the final valley closest to '''A'''). If no marbles cross point '''C''' before the first marble crosses point '''D''', we must apply the second profile shortly ''before'' the first marble crosses point '''D''', to start over.

It easily follows that eventually we will have marbles at point '''A''', but none at point '''B'''. Hence for a problem defined with having marbles at point '''A''' being a win and having marbles at point '''B''' a loss, we clearly win by playing two losing games.

===The coin-tossing example===
A second example of Parrondo's paradox is drawn from the field of gambling. Consider playing two games, '''Game A''' and '''Game B''' with the following rules. For convenience, define &lt;math&gt;C_t &lt;/math&gt; to be our capital at time ''t'', immediately before we play a game.
# Winning a game earns us $1 and losing requires us to surrender $1. It follows that &lt;math&gt;C_{t+1} = C_t +1 &lt;/math&gt; if we win at step ''t'' and &lt;math&gt;C_{t+1} = C_t -1 &lt;/math&gt; if we lose at step ''t''.
# In '''Game A''', we toss a biased coin, Coin 1, with probability of winning &lt;math&gt;P_1=(1/2)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, this is clearly a losing game in the long run.
# In '''Game B''', we first determine if our capital is a multiple of some integer &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. If it is, we toss a biased coin, Coin 2, with probability of winning &lt;math&gt;P_2=(1/10)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. If it is not, we toss another biased coin, Coin 3, with probability of winning &lt;math&gt;P_3=(3/4)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The role of modulo &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; provides the periodicity as in the ratchet teeth.

It is clear that by playing Game A, we will almost surely lose in the long run. Harmer and Abbott&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmer | first1 = G. P. | authorlink2 = Derek Abbott | last2 = Abbott | first2 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Losing strategies can win by Parrondo's paradox | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 402 | issue = | page = 864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show via simulation that if &lt;math&gt;M=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0.005,&lt;/math&gt; Game B is an almost surely losing game as well. In fact, Game B is a [[Markov chain]], and an analysis of its state transition matrix (again with M=3) shows that the steady state probability of using coin 2 is 0.3836, and that of using coin 3 is 0.6164.&lt;ref&gt;D. Minor, "Parrondo's Paradox - Hope for Losers!", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34(1) (2003) 15-20&lt;/ref&gt; As coin 2 is selected nearly 40% of the time, it has a disproportionate influence on the payoff from Game B, and results in it being a losing game.

However, when these two losing games are played in some alternating sequence - e.g. two games of A followed by two games of B (AABBAABB...), the combination of the two games is, paradoxically, a ''winning'' game. Not all alternating sequences of A and B result in winning games. For example, one game of A followed by one game of B (ABABAB...) is a losing game, while one game of A followed by two games of B (ABBABB...) is a winning game. This coin-tossing example has become the canonical illustration of Parrondo's paradox – two games, both losing when played individually, become a winning game when played in a particular alternating sequence. The apparent paradox has been explained using a number of sophisticated approaches, including Markov chains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmer | first1 = G.

Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics in the Lakes'', Ambleside, U.K., [[Peter V. E. McClintock|P. V. E. McClintock]], ed., American Institute of Physics, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One way to explain the apparent paradox is as follows:
* While Game B is a losing game under the probability distribution that results for &lt;math&gt;C_t &lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when it is played individually (&lt;math&gt;C_t &lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder when &lt;math&gt;C_t &lt;/math&gt; is divided by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;), it can be a winning game under other distributions, as there is at least one state in which its expectation is positive.
* As the distribution of outcomes of Game B depend on the player's capital, the two games '''cannot''' be independent. If they were, playing them in any sequence would lose as well.

The role of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; now comes into sharp focus. It serves solely to induce a dependence between Games A and B, so that a player is more likely to enter states in which Game B has a positive expectation, allowing it to overcome the losses from Game A. With this understanding, the paradox resolves itself: The individual games are losing only under a distribution that differs from that which is actually encountered when playing the compound game. In summary, Parrondo's paradox is an example of how dependence can wreak havoc with probabilistic computations made under a naive assumption of independence. A more detailed exposition of this point, along with several related examples, can be found in Philips and Feldman.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Philips and Andrew B. Feldman, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=581521 ''Parrondo's Paradox is not Paradoxical''], Social Science Research Network (SSRN) Working Papers, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===A simplified example===
For a simpler example of how and why the paradox works, again consider two games '''Game A''' and '''Game B''', this time with the following rules:
# In '''Game A''', you simply lose $1 every time you play.
# In '''Game B''', you count how much money you have left. If it is an even number, you win $3. Otherwise you lose $5.

Say you begin with $100 in your pocket. If you start playing Game A exclusively, you will obviously lose all your money in 100 rounds. Similarly, if you decide to play Game B exclusively, you will also lose all your money in 100 rounds.

However, consider playing the games alternatively, starting with Game B, followed by A, then by B, and so on (BABABA...). It should be easy to see that you will steadily earn a total of $2 for every two games.

Thus, even though each game is a losing proposition if played alone, because the results of Game B are affected by Game A, the sequence in which the games are played can affect how often Game B earns you money, and subsequently the result is different from the case where either game is played by itself.

==Applications==
Parrondo's paradox is used extensively in game theory, and its application to engineering, population dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;V. A. A. Jansen and J. Yoshimura "Populations can persist in an environment consisting of sink habitats only". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'', '''95'''(1998), 3696-3698 .&lt;/ref&gt; financial risk, etc., are areas of active research, as demonstrated by the reading lists below. Parrondo's games are of little practical use such as for investing in [[stock market]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iyengar | first1 = R. | last2 = Kohli | first2 = R. | year = 2004 | title = Why Parrondo's paradox is irrelevant for utility theory, stock buying, and the emergence of life | url = | journal = Complexity | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 23–27 | doi=10.1002/cplx.10112}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the original games require the payoff from at least one of the interacting games to depend on the player's capital. However, the games need not be restricted to their original form and work continues in generalizing the phenomenon. Similarities to volatility pumping and the [[Two envelopes problem|two-envelope problem]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/pdf169811689.pdf Winning While Losing: New Strategy Solves'Two-Envelope' Paradox] at Physorg.com&lt;/ref&gt; have been pointed out.

Stutzer, The Paradox of Diversification, ''[[The Journal of Investing]]'', Vol. 19, No.1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a model that is often used to illustrate optimal betting rules has been used to prove that splitting bets between multiple games can turn a negative median long-term return into a positive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutzer | first1 = M. | title = A Simple Parrondo Paradox | url = | journal = Mathematical Scientist | volume = V | issue = 35| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In evolutionary biology, both bacterial [[Phase variation|random phase variation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Denise M.|last2=Vazirani|first2=Vijay V.|last3=Arkin|first3=Adam P.|date=2005-05-21|title=Diversity in times of adversity: probabilistic strategies in microbial survival games|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304005740|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=234|issue=2|pages=227–253|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.020|pmid=15757681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the evolution of less accurate sensors&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheong|first=Kang Hao|last2=Tan|first2=Zong Xuan|last3=Xie|first3=Neng-gang|last4=Jones|first4=Michael C.|date=2016-10-14|title=A Paradoxical Evolutionary Mechanism in Stochastically Switching Environments|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34889|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep34889|issn=2045-2322|page=34889|pmid=27739447|pmc=5064378}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been modelled and explained in terms of the paradox.

==Name==
In the early literature on Parrondo's paradox, it was debated whether the word 'paradox' is an appropriate description given that the Parrondo effect can be understood in mathematical terms. The 'paradoxical' effect can be mathematically explained in terms of a convex linear combination.

However, [[Derek Abbott]], a leading Parrondo's paradox researcher, provides the following answer regarding the use of the word 'paradox' in this context:
{{quote| Is Parrondo's paradox really a "paradox"? This question is sometimes asked by mathematicians, whereas physicists usually don't worry about such things. The first thing to point out is that "Parrondo's paradox" is just a name, just like the "[[Braess' paradox]]" or "[[Simpson's paradox]]." Secondly, as is the case with most of these named paradoxes they are all really apparent paradoxes. People drop the word "apparent" in these cases as it is a mouthful, and it is obvious anyway. So no one claims these are paradoxes in the strict sense. In the wide sense, a paradox is simply something that is counterintuitive. Parrondo's games certainly are counterintuitive—at least until you have intensively studied them for a few months. The truth is we still keep finding new surprising things to delight us, as we research these games. I have had one mathematician complain that the games always were obvious to him and hence we should not use the word "paradox." He is either a genius or never really understood it in the first place. In either case, it is not worth arguing with people like that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Groups/parrondo/faq.html#faq12 |title="The Official Parrondo's Paradox Page" |last=Abbott |first=Derek |publisher=The University of Adelaide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621224639/http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Groups/parrondo/faq.html |archive-date=21 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Parrondo's paradox does not seem that paradoxical if one notes that it is actually a combination of three simple games: two of which have losing probabilities and one of which has a high probability of winning. To suggest that one can create a winning strategy with three such games is neither counterintuitive nor paradoxical.

In [[mathematics]], a '''planar lamina''' is a [[closed set]] in a plane of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and surface density &lt;math&gt;\rho\ (x,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \int\int_{}{}\rho\ (x,y)\,dx\,dy&lt;/math&gt;, over the [[closed set]].

The [[center of mass]] of the lamina is at the point

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{M_y}{m},\frac{M_x}{m}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_y &lt;/math&gt; moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis and &lt;math&gt;M_x &lt;/math&gt; moment of the entire lamina about the y-axis.

:&lt;math&gt;M_y = \lim_{m,n \to \infty}\,\sum_{i=1}^{m}\,\sum_{j=1}^{n}\,x{_{ij}}^{*}\,\rho\ (x{_{ij}}^{*},y{_{ij}}^{*})\,\Delta\Alpha = \iint_{}{} x\, \rho\ (x,y)\,dx\,dy&lt;/math&gt;, over the closed surface.

:&lt;math&gt;M_x = \lim_{m,n \to \infty}\,\sum_{i=1}^{m}\,\sum_{j=1}^{n}\,y{_{ij}}^{*}\,\rho\ (x{_{ij}}^{*},y{_{ij}}^{*})\,\Delta\Alpha  = \iint_{}{} y\, \rho\ (x,y)\,dx\,dy&lt;/math&gt;, over the closed surface.

Example 1.

Find the center of mass of a lamina with edges given by the lines &lt;math&gt;x=0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=4-x&lt;/math&gt; where the density is given as &lt;math&gt;\rho\ (x,y)\,=2x+3y+2&lt;/math&gt;.  

:&lt;math&gt;m = \int_0^2{\int_x^{4-x}}_{}{}\,(2x+3y+2)\,dy\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:Integrate 2x + 3y + 2 with respect to y and substitute the limits 4-x and x

:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_0^2\left(2xy+\frac{3y^2}{2}+2y\right)\Bigg|_x^{4-x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_0^2\left(\Big[2x(4-x)+\frac{3(4-x)^2}{2}+2(4-x)\Big]-\Big[2x(x)+\frac{3(x)^2}{2}+2(x)\Big]\right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_0^2\left(8x-2x^2+\frac{3x^2-24x+48}{2}+8-2x-2x^2-\frac{3x^2}{2}-2x\right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_0^2\left(8x-2x^2+\frac{3}{2}x^2-12x+24+8-2x-2x^2-\frac{3}{2}x^2-2x\right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_0^2(-4x^2-8x+32)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m=\left(-\frac{4x^3}{3}-4x^2+32x\right)\Bigg|_0^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m= \frac{112}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_y = \int_0^2{\int_x^{4-x}}{}{}x\,(2x+3y+2)\,dy\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_y=\int_0^2\left(2x^2y+\frac{3xy^2}{2}+2xy\right)\Bigg|_x^{4-x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_y=\int_0^2(-4x^3-8x^2+32x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_y=\left(-x^4-\frac{8x^3}{3}+16x^2\right)\Bigg|_0^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_y= \frac{80}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_x = \int_0^2{\int_x^{4-x}}{}{}y\,(2x+3y+2)\,dy\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_x = \int_0^2(xy^2+y^3+y^2)\Big|_x^{4-x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_x = \int_0^2(-2x^3+4x^2-40x+80)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_x=\left(-\frac{x^4}{2}+\frac{4x^3}{3}-20x^2+80x\right)\Bigg|_0^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_x= \frac{248}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

center of mass is at the point

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\frac{80}{3}}{\frac{112}{3}},\frac{\frac{248}{3}}{\frac{112}{3}}\right)=\left(\frac{5}{7},\frac{31}{14}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Planar laminas can be used to determine [[moments of inertia]], or center of mass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">In [[mathematics]] a '''primitive abundant number''' is an [[abundant number]] whose [[proper divisor]]s are all [[deficient number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Primitive Abundant Number|urlname=PrimitiveAbundantNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdős adopts a wider definition that requires a primitive abundant number to be not deficient, but not necessarily abundant (Erdős, Surányi and Guiduli. ''Topics in the Theory of Numbers'' p214. Springer 2003.). The Erdős definition allows [[perfect number]]s to be primitive abundant numbers too.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, 20 is a primitive abundant number because:
:#The sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22, so 20 is an abundant number.
:#The sums of the proper divisors of 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 are 0, 1, 3, 1 and 8 respectively, so each of these numbers is a deficient number.

The first few primitive abundant numbers are:

:[[20 (number)|20]], [[70 (number)|70]], [[88 (number)|88]], [[104 (number)|104]], 272, 304, 368, 464, 550, 572 ... {{OEIS|id=A071395}}

The smallest odd primitive abundant number is 945.

A variant definition is abundant numbers having no abundant proper divisor {{OEIS|id=A091191}}. It starts: 

: [[12 (number)|12]], [[18 (number)|18]], [[20 (number)|20]], [[30 (number)|30]], 42, 56, 66, 70, 78, 88, 102, 104, 114 
 
&lt;!-- The number 84, which equals 28×3, is not a primitive abundant number under either definition even though 28 is perfect and 3 is prime. --&gt;
==Properties==

Every multiple of a primitive abundant number is an abundant number.

Every abundant number is a multiple of a primitive abundant number or a multiple of a perfect number.

Every primitive abundant number is either a [[primitive semiperfect number]] or a [[weird number]].

There are an infinite number of primitive abundant numbers.

The number of primitive abundant numbers less than or equal to ''n'' is &lt;math&gt;o \left( \frac{n}{\log^2(n)} \right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erdős, ''Journal of the London Mathematical Society'' 9 (1934) 278&amp;ndash;282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[information security]], [[computer science]], and other fields, the '''principle of least privilege''' ('''PoLP''', also known as the '''principle of minimal privilege''' or the '''principle of least authority''') requires that in a particular [[abstraction layer]] of a computing environment, every module (such as a [[process (computing)|process]], a [[user (computing)|user]], or a [[computer program|program]], depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and [[resource (computer science)|resource]]s that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Saltzer &amp; Schroeder 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denning 76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==

The principle means giving a [[user account]] or process only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. For example, a user account for the sole purpose of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked. The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal user account, and opens a privileged, password protected account (that is, a [[superuser]]) only when the situation absolutely demands it.

When applied to [[user (computing)|users]], the terms ''least user access'' or ''least-privileged user account'' (LUA) are also used, referring to the concept that all [[user account]]s at all times should run with as few [[privilege (computer science)|privilege]]s as possible, and also launch [[application software|application]]s with as few privileges as possible.

The principle of least privilege is widely recognized as an important design consideration in enhancing the protection of data and functionality from faults ([[fault tolerance]]) and malicious behavior ([[computer security]]).

Benefits of the principle include:

* Better system stability. When code is limited in the scope of changes it can make to a system, it is easier to test its possible actions and interactions with other applications. In practice for example, applications running with restricted rights will not have access to perform operations that could crash a machine, or adversely affect other applications running on the same system.
* Better system security. When code is limited in the system-wide actions it may perform, vulnerabilities in one application cannot be used to exploit the rest of the machine. For example, Microsoft states “Running in standard user mode gives customers increased protection against inadvertent system-level damage caused by "[[shatter attack]]s" and [[malware]], such as [[root kit]]s, spyware, and undetectable [[computer virus|viruses]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=4135 | title = Virtualization Guru Writes "User-mode is a Good Thing - Deployment to Locked-down Accounts without Security Elevation" | accessdate = 15 Mar 2013 | last1= Jonathan | first1= Clark | author2= DABCC Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ease of deployment. In general, the fewer privileges an application requires the easier it is to deploy within a larger environment. This usually results from the first two benefits, applications that install device drivers or require elevated security privileges typically have additional steps involved in their deployment. For example, on Windows a solution with no [[device driver]]s can be run directly with no installation, while device drivers must be installed separately using the Windows installer service in order to grant the driver elevated privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc160944.aspx|title=Problems of Privilege: Find and Fix LUA Bugs|author=Aaron Margosis|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, there exist multiple competing definitions of [[true least privilege]]. As [[program complexity]] increases at an exponential rate{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, so do the number of potential issues, rendering a predictive approach impractical. Examples include the values of variables it may process, addresses it will need, or the precise time such things will be required. Object capability systems allow, for instance, deferring granting a single-use privilege until the time when it will be used. Currently, the closest practical approach is to eliminate privileges that can be manually evaluated as unnecessary. The resulting set of privileges typically exceeds the true minimum required privileges for the process.

Another limitation is the granularity of control that the operating environment has over privileges for an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/daisy/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/351.html Matt Bishop, ''Computer Security: Art and Science'', Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2003. pp. 343-344 cited Barnum &amp; Gegick 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it is rarely possible to control a process's access to memory, processing time, I/O device addresses or modes with the precision needed to facilitate only the precise set of privileges a process will require.

== History ==

The original formulation is from [[Jerome H. Saltzer|Jerome Saltzer]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saltzer|first=Jerome H.|year=1974|title=Protection and the control of information sharing in multics|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=17|issue=7|pages=389|issn=0001-0782|doi=10.1145/361011.361067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job.|sign=[[Jerome H. Saltzer|Jerome Saltzer]]|source=''[[Communications of the ACM]]''}}

[[Peter J. Denning]], in his paper "Fault Tolerant Operating Systems", set it in a broader perspective among four fundamental principles of fault tolerance.

Dynamic assignments of privileges was earlier discussed by [[Roger Needham]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Needham, ''Protection systems and protection implementations'', Proc. 1972 Fall Joint Computer Conference, AFIPS Conf. Proc., vol. 41, pt. 1, pp. 571-578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/leastPrivNeedham.pdf |author=Fred B. Schneider |title=Least Privilege and More}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the oldest instance of least privilege is probably the source code of ''login.c'', which begins execution with [[super-user]] permissions and—the instant they are no longer necessary—dismisses them via ''setuid()'' with a non-zero argument as demonstrated in the [[Version 6 Unix]] [http://www.retro11.de/ouxr/u6ed/usr/source/s1/login.c.html#n:132 source code.]

== Implementation ==
{{Confusing section|date=September 2014}}
The [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] always runs with maximum privileges since it is the [[operating system]] core and has hardware access. One of the principal responsibilities of an operating system, particularly a multi-user operating system, is management of the hardware's availability and requests to access it from running [[Process (computing)|processes]]. When the kernel crashes, the mechanisms by which it maintains state also fail. Even if there is a way for the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] to recover without a [[hard reset]], the code that resumes execution is not always what it should be. Security continues to be enforced, but the operating system cannot respond to the failure properly because detection of the failure was not possible. This is because kernel execution either halted or the [[program counter]] resumed execution from somewhere in endless, and—usually—non-functional loop.

If execution picks up, after the crash, by loading and running [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan code]], the author of the trojan code can usurp control of all processes. The principle of least privilege forces code to run with the lowest privilege/permission level possible so that, in the event this occurs—or even if code execution picks up from an unexpected location—what resumes the code execution would not have the ability to perform malicious or undesirable things. One method used to accomplish this can be implemented in the microprocessor hardware. In the [[Intel x86]] architecture, the manufacturer designed four (ring 0 through ring 3) running "modes".

As implemented in some operating systems, processes execute with a potential privilege set and an active privilege set. Such privilege sets are inherited from the parent as determined by the semantics of ''[[Fork (operating system)|fork]]()''. An executable file that performs a privileged function—thereby technically constituting a component of the [[Trusted computing base|TCB]], and concomitantly termed a trusted program or trusted process—may also be marked with a set of privileges, a logical extension of the notions of [[setuid|set user ID]] and [[setgid|set group ID]]. The inheritance of file privileges by a process are determined by the semantics of the ''exec()'' family of system calls. The precise manner in which potential process privileges, actual process privileges, and file privileges interact can become complex. In practice, least privilege is practiced by forcing a process to run with only those privileges required by the task. Adherence to this model is quite complex as well as error-prone.

== Similar principles ==

The [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC) concept of [[trusted computing base]] (TCB) minimization is a far more stringent requirement that is only applicable to the functionally strongest assurance classes, ''viz.'', B3 and A1 (which are ''evidentiarily'' different but ''functionally'' identical).

Least privilege is often associated with [[privilege bracketing]]: that is, assuming necessary privileges at the last possible moment and dismissing them as soon as no longer strictly necessary, therefore ostensibly reducing fallout from erroneous code that unintentionally exploits more privilege than is merited. Least privilege has also been interpreted in the context of distribution of [[discretionary access control]] (DAC) permissions, for example asserting that giving user U read/write access to file F violates least privilege if U can complete his authorized tasks with only read permission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">A '''queue machine''' or '''queue automaton''' is a [[finite state machine]] with the ability to store and retrieve data from an infinite-memory [[queue (data structure)|queue]]. It is a model of computation equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], and therefore it can process the same class of [[formal language]]s.

== Theory ==
A queue machine can be defined as a six-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \$, s, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; where

* &lt;math&gt;\,Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Sigma \subset \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite set of the ''input alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite ''queue alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\$ \in \Gamma - \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial queue symbol'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,s \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the ''start state'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; is the ''transition function''.

A machine ''configuration'' is an ordered pair of its state and queue contents &lt;math&gt;\,(q,\gamma)\in Q\times\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kleene closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The starting configuration on an input string &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\,(s,x\$)&lt;/math&gt;, and the transition &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow_M^1&lt;/math&gt; from one configuration to the next is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(p,A\alpha) \rightarrow_M^1 (q,\alpha\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a symbol from the queue alphabet, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of queue symbols (&lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;(q, \gamma) = \delta(p, A)&lt;/math&gt;. Note the "first-in-first-out" property of the queue in the relation.

The machine accepts a string &lt;math&gt;\,x\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; if after a &lt;!---replaced "(possibly infinite)" by opposite property: all automatons (on string sets) I know are allowed only finitely many steps; allowing infinitely many steps would make simulation by Turing machine (see next section) impossible in general---&gt;finite number of transitions the starting configuration evolves to exhaust the string (reaching a null string &lt;math&gt;\,\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;), or &lt;math&gt;\,(s,x\$)\rightarrow_M^*(q,\epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kozen |first=Dexter C. |editor=David Gries, Fred B. Schneider |title=Automata and Computability |origyear=1951 |type=hardcover |edition=1 |series=Undergraduate Texts in Computer Science |year=1997 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=0-387-94907-0 |pages=368–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turing completeness ===
We can prove that a queue machine is equivalent to a Turing machine by showing that a queue machine can simulate a Turing machine and vice versa.

A Turing machine can be simulated by a queue machine that keeps a copy of the Turing machine's contents in its queue at all times, with two special markers: one for the TM's head position, and one for the end of the tape; its transitions simulate those of the TM by running through the whole queue, popping off each of its symbols and re-enqueing either the popped symbol, or, near the head position, the equivalent of the TM transition's effect.

A queue machine can be simulated by a Turing machine, but more easily by a [[multi-tape Turing machine]], which is known to be equivalent to a normal single-tape machine.
The simulating queue machine reads input on one tape and stores the queue on the second, with pushes and pops defined by simple transitions to the beginning and end symbols of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~rus/Courses/Theory/Notes/turing3.pdf |title=Variants of Turing Machines |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Rus |first=Teodor |work=Lecture Notes Covering Theory of Computation |publisher=University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1419 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921051611/http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~rus/Courses/Theory/Notes/turing3.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal proof of this is often an exercise in theoretical computer science courses.

'''Sampling risk''' is one of the many types of risks an auditor may face when performing the necessary procedure of audit sampling. Audit sampling exists because of the impractical and costly effects of examining all or 100% of a client's records or books. As a result, a "sample" of a client's accounts are examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Audit Sampling Requires Auditor Judgment |url=http://www.resourcemanagement.com/audit_sampling.html |publisher=The Agency Examiner |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the negative effects produced by sampling risk, an auditor may have to perform additional procedures which in turn can impact the overall efficiency of the [[audit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pakaccountants.com/what-is-sampling-risk-in-auditing/ |title=What is Sampling Risk in Auditing? |publisher=Pak Accountants |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sampling risk represents the possibility that an [[auditor]]'s conclusion based on a sample is different from that reached if the entire [[population]] were subject to audit procedure. The auditor may conclude that material misstatements exist, when in fact they do not; or material misstatements do not exist but in fact they do exist. Auditors can lower the sampling risk by increasing the [[Sample size|sampling size]].

Although there are many types of risks associated with the audit process, each type primarily has an effect on the overall audit engagement. The effects produced by sampling risk generally can increase '''audit risk''', the risk that an entity's financial statements will contain a material misstatement, though given an unqualified ('clean') audit report. Sampling risk can also increase '''detection risk''' which suggests the possibility that an auditor will not find material misstatements relating to the financial statements through substantive tests and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detection Risk |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/detection-risk.asp#axzz2Dp909dYp |publisher=Investopedia |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of sampling risk==

===Typical scenarios===
Auditors must often make professional judgments in assessing sampling risk. When testing samples the auditor is primarily concerned with two aspects of sampling risk:&lt;ref name="AU Section 350"&gt;{{cite web |title=AU Section 350 |format=pdf |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00350.pdf |work=Audit Sampling |publisher=AICPA |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Risk of accepting incorrect data''': the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded account balance is not materially misstated when '''it is''' materially misstated.

'''Risk of incorrect rejection''': the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded amount balance is materially misstated when '''it is not''' materially misstated.

In addition, the auditor is concerned with sampling risk and its relationship with controls.  Two types of sample risk/control risks are:

'''Assessing too low''': the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is '''less than''' the true operating effectiveness of the control.

'''Assessing too high''': the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is '''greater than''' the true operating effectiveness of the control.

==Sample selection==

When selecting a sampling approach there are two approaches to audit sampling: '''non-statistical''' and '''statistical approach'''. Three ways that statistical sampling can assist the auditor are: to maximize the productivity with minimum wasted effort in designing the sample, to measure the sufficiency of the evidence taken during the audit, and to analyze the results. The statistical approach allows the auditor to measure the risk that is being sampled to help in reducing it to an acceptable level. With respect to performing samples, statistical sampling involves different kinds of costs such as training the auditors, designing individual samples to meet the requirements, and choosing the items to be examined. If there is insufficient audit evidence it is the responsibility of the auditor to choose between non statistical or the statistical sampling approaches considering their effectiveness and related costs.&lt;ref name="AU Section 350"/&gt;

Although exercising careful judgment is crucial during every step of the sampling process, it is extremely necessary when choosing the non-statistical approach. This method does not include the use of tables or statistical percentages, but rather it relies upon professional judgment on the part of the auditor as well as the policy implemented by the firm. Under this approach, it is common practice for most accounting firms to create universal guidelines for auditors in order to determine a proper sample size. For example, if a given client's control risk is high, a firm would typically require a high sample size when selecting records.

In order to successfully gather a sample, it is important to consider the collection as a whole and the relevance of the particular items. The most common successful method is to select an even number of items which accurately represents the list as a whole. Selecting only large or small numbers could distort the sample which creates risk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10454">'''Special functions''' are particular [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]s which have more or less established names and notations due to their importance in [[mathematical analysis]], [[functional analysis]], [[physics]], or other applications.

There is no general formal definition, but the [[list of mathematical functions]] contains functions which are commonly accepted as special.

&lt;!-- {{under construction}}
--&gt;
==Tables of special functions==
Many special functions appear as solutions of [[differential equation]]s or [[integral]]s of [[elementary functions]]. Therefore, tables of integrals&lt;ref name="Zwillinger_2014"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Izrail Solomonovich |author-last1=Gradshteyn |author-link1=Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn |author-first2=Iosif Moiseevich |author-last2=Ryzhik |author-link2=Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik |author-first3=Yuri Veniaminovich |author-last3=Geronimus |author-link3=Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus |author-first4=Michail Yulyevich |author-last4=Tseytlin |author-link4=Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin |author-first5=Alan |author-last5=Jeffrey |editor-first1=Daniel |editor-last1=Zwillinger |editor-first2=Victor Hugo |editor-last2=Moll |translator=Scripta Technica, Inc. |title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |publisher=[[Academic Press, Inc.]] |date=2015 |orig-year=October 2014 |edition=8 |language=English |isbn=0-12-384933-0 |id={{isbn|978-0-12-384933-5}} |lccn=2014010276 &lt;!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjnLAwAAQBAJ |access-date=2016-02-21--&gt;|title-link=Gradshteyn and Ryzhik}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually include descriptions of special functions, and tables of special functions&lt;ref name="IRENE"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; include most important integrals; at least, the integral representation of special functions. Because symmetries of differential equations are essential to both physics and mathematics, the theory of special functions is closely related to the theory of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s, as well as certain topics in [[mathematical physics]].

[[Symbolic computation]] engines usually recognize the majority of special functions. Not all such systems have efficient algorithms for the evaluation, especially in the [[complex plane]].

===Notations used for special functions===
Functions with established international notations are [[Sine|sin]], [[Cosine|cos]], [[Exponential function|exp]], [[error function|erf]], and [[erfc]].

Some special functions have several notations:

* The [[natural logarithm]] can be written Log, log, log&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; or ln, depending on the context. 
* The [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] function may be denoted Tan, tan or tg (especially in Russian and Bulgarian literature).
* [[Arctangent]] may be called arctan, atan, arctg, or tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* [[Bessel function]]s may be written
** &lt;math&gt;~J_n(x),~&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;~{\rm besselj}(n,x), ~&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;~ {\rm BesselJ}[n,x].~&lt;/math&gt;

Subscripts are often used to indicate arguments, typically integers. In a few cases, the semicolon (;) or even backslash (\) is used as a separator. In this case, the translation to algorithmic languages admits [[Ambiguity#Ambiguity in names of functions|ambiguity]] and may lead to confusion.

Superscripts may indicate not only exponentiation, but modification of a function. Examples (particularly with [[trigonometric function]]s and [[hyperbolic function]]s) include:

* &lt;math&gt;~\cos^3(x)~&lt;/math&gt; usually indicates &lt;math&gt;~(\cos(x))^3~&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;~\cos^2(x)~&lt;/math&gt; is typically &lt;math&gt;~(\cos(x))^2~&lt;/math&gt;, but never &lt;math&gt;~\cos(\cos(x))~&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;~\cos^{-1}(x)~&lt;/math&gt; usually means &lt;math&gt;~\arccos(x)~&lt;/math&gt;, and not &lt;math&gt;~(\cos(x))^{-1}~&lt;/math&gt;; this one typically causes the most confusion, since interpretation with this exponent value is inconsistent with the others.

===Evaluation of special functions===
Most special functions are considered as a function of a complex variable. They are [[analytic function|analytic]]; the singularities and cuts are described; the differential and integral representations are known and the expansion to the [[Taylor series]] or [[asymptotic series]] are available. In addition, sometimes there exist relations with other special functions; a complicated special function can be expressed in terms of simpler functions. Various representations can be used for the evaluation;  the simplest way to evaluate a function is to expand it into a Taylor series. However, such representation may converge slowly if at all. In algorithmic languages, [[Pade approximation|rational approximation]]s are typically used, although they may behave badly in the case of complex argument(s).

==History of special functions==

===Classical theory===
While [[trigonometry]] can be codified{{snd}} as was clear already to expert mathematicians of the eighteenth century (if not before){{snd}} the search for a complete and unified theory of special functions has continued since the nineteenth century. The high point of special function theory in the period 1800-1900 was the theory of [[elliptic function]]s; treatises that were essentially complete, such as that of [[Tannery and Molk]], could be written as handbooks to all the basic identities of the theory. They were based on techniques from [[complex analysis]].

From that time onwards it would be assumed that [[analytic function]] theory, which had already unified the trigonometric and [[exponential function]]s, was a fundamental tool. The end of the century also saw a very detailed discussion of [[spherical harmonic]]s.

===Changing and fixed motivations===
Of course the wish for a broad theory including as many as possible of the known special functions has its intellectual appeal, but it is worth noting other motivations.  For a long time, the special functions were in the particular province of [[applied mathematics]]; applications to the physical sciences and engineering determined the relative importance of functions. In the days before the [[electronic computer]], the ultimate compliment to a special function was the computation, by hand, of extended [[Mathematical table|tables of its values]]. This was a capital-intensive process, intended to make the function available by [[Look-up table|look-up]], as for the familiar [[logarithm tables]]. The aspects of the theory that then mattered might then be two:

* for [[numerical analysis]], discovery of [[infinite series]] or other [[analytical expression]] allowing rapid calculation; and
* reduction of as many functions as possible to the given function.

In contrast, one might say, there are approaches typical of the interests of [[pure mathematics]]: [[asymptotic analysis]], [[analytic continuation]] and [[monodromy]] in the [[complex plane]], and the discovery of [[symmetry]] principles and other structure behind the façade of endless formulae in rows.  There is not a real conflict between these approaches, in fact.

===Twentieth century===
The twentieth century saw several waves of interest in special function theory.  The classic ''[[Whittaker and Watson]]'' (1902) textbook sought to unify the theory by using [[complex variable]]s; the [[G. N. Watson]] tome ''A Treatise on the Theory of Bessel Functions'' pushed the techniques as far as possible for one important type that particularly admitted asymptotics to be studied.

The later [[Bateman Manuscript Project]], under the editorship of [[Arthur Erdélyi]], attempted to be encyclopedic, and came around the time when electronic computation was coming to the fore and tabulation ceased to be the main issue.

===Contemporary theories===
The modern theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]] is of a definite but limited scope. [[Hypergeometric series]] became an intricate theory, in need of later conceptual arrangement. [[Lie group]]s, and in particular their [[representation theory]], explain what a [[Zonal spherical function|spherical function]] can be in general; from 1950 onwards substantial parts of classical theory could be recast in terms of Lie groups. Further,  work on [[algebraic combinatorics]] also revived interest in older parts of the theory. Conjectures of [[Ian G. Macdonald]] helped to open up large and active new fields with the typical special function flavour. [[Difference equation]]s have begun to take their place besides [[differential equation]]s as a source for special functions.

==Special functions in number theory==
In [[number theory]], certain special functions have traditionally been studied, such as particular [[Dirichlet series]] and [[modular form]]s. Almost all aspects of special function theory are reflected there, as well as some new ones, such as came out of the [[monstrous moonshine]] theory.

'''Steve Shnider''' is professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Bar Ilan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.biu.ac.il/People/shnider.html |title=Prof. Steven Shnider - staff page |language=he |publisher=Bar Ilan University |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221163346/http://www.math.biu.ac.il/People/shnider.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He received a PhD in Mathematics from [[Harvard University]] in 1972, under [[Shlomo Sternberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=69034 Steven David Shnider,] [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]. Accessed January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
His main interests are in the [[differential geometry]] of [[fiber bundle]]s; algebraic methods in the theory of [[Deformation theory|deformation]] of geometric structures; [[symplectic geometry]]; [[supersymmetry]]; [[operad theory|operads]]; and [[Hopf algebra]]s.

==Book on operads==
A 2002 book of Markl, Shnider and Stasheff ''Operads in algebra, topology, and physics'' was the first book to  provide a systematic treatment of [[operad theory]], an area of mathematics that came to prominence in 1990s and  found many applications in [[algebraic topology]], [[category theory]], graph cohomology, [[representation theory]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[combinatorics]], [[knot theory]], [[moduli space]]s, and other areas. The book was the subject of a ''Featured Review'' in [[Mathematical Reviews]] by Alexander A. Voronov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander A. Voronov| mr=1898414|title=Review of ''Operads in algebra, topology and physics}} (2003f:18011) [[MathSciNet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/bookstore-getitem/item=SURV-96-S AMS Bookstore listing], [[American Mathematical Society]]. Accessed January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which stated, in particular: "The first book whose main goal is the theory of operads per se ... a book such as this one has been long awaited by a wide scientific readership, including mathematicians and theoretical physicists ... a great piece of mathematical literature and will be helpful to anyone who needs to use operads, from graduate students to mature mathematicians and physicists."

==Bibliography==
According to [[Mathematical Reviews]], Shnider's work has been cited over 300 times  by over 300 authors by 2010.

{{wiktionary}}

In [[mathematics|mathematical]] writing, the adjective '''strict''' is used to modify technical terms which have multiple meanings. It indicates that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. (More formally, one could say that this is the meaning which implies the other meanings.) The opposite is '''non-strict'''. This is often implicit but can be put explicitly for clarity. In some contexts the word "proper" is used as a mathematical synonym for "strict".

==Use==
This term is commonly used in the context of [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] &amp;mdash; the phrase "strictly less than" means "less than and not equal to" (likewise "strictly greater than" means "greater than and not equal to"). More generally a [[Partially_ordered_set#Strict_and_non-strict_partial_orders|strict partial order]], [[strict total order]] and [[Strict weak ordering|strict weak order]] exclude equality and equivalence

A related use occurs when comparing numbers to zero &amp;mdash; "strictly positive" and "strictly negative" mean "positive and not equal to zero" and "negative and not equal to zero", respectively. Also, in the context of functions, the adverb "strictly" is used to modify the terms "monotonic", "increasing", and "decreasing".

On the other hand, sometimes one wants to specify the inclusive meanings of terms. In the context of comparisons, one can use the phrases "non-negative", "non-positive", "non-increasing", and "non-decreasing" to make it clear that the inclusive sense of the terms is intended.

Using such terminology helps avoid possible ambiguity and confusion. For instance, upon reading the phrase "''x'' is positive", it is not immediately clear whether ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is possible, since some authors might use the term ''positive'' loosely, and mean that ''x''  is not less than zero. Therefore, it is prudent to write "''x'' is strictly positive" for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and "''x'' is non-negative" for ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. (A precise term like ''non-negative'' is never used with the word ''negative'' in the wide, loose sense that includes zero.)

The word "proper" is often used in the same way as "strict." For example, a "[[proper subset]]" of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a [[subset]] that is not equal to ''S'' itself, and a "[[proper class]]" is a class which is not also a set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7298">'''Sylvester's law of inertia''' is a [[theorem]] in [[matrix algebra]] about certain properties of the [[coefficient matrix]] of a [[real number|real]] [[quadratic form]] that remain [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a [[change of basis]]. Namely, if ''A'' is the [[symmetric matrix]] that defines the quadratic form, and ''S'' is any invertible matrix such that ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''SAS''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal, then the number of negative elements in the diagonal of ''D'' is always the same, for all such ''S''; and the same goes for the number of positive elements.

This property is named after [[James Joseph Sylvester]] who published its proof in 1852.&lt;ref name=syl852&gt;
  {{cite journal|last=Sylvester|first=James Joseph|authorlink=James Joseph Sylvester | title=A demonstration of the theorem that every homogeneous quadratic polynomial is reducible by real orthogonal substitutions to the form of a sum of positive and negative squares | journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=4th Series| volume=4 | issue=23 | pages=138–142 | year=1852 |  url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/sylv/inertia.pdf | doi= 10.1080/14786445208647087 | accessdate=2008-06-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=norm&gt;
  {{cite book|last=Norman|first= C.W.| title=Undergraduate algebra | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | pages=360–361 | year=1986 |  isbn=978-0-19-853248-4 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement of the theorem ==
Let ''A'' be a symmetric square matrix of order ''n'' with [[real number|real]] entries. Any [[non-singular matrix]] ''S'' of the same size is said to transform ''A'' into another symmetric matrix {{nowrap|1=''B'' = ''SAS''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}, also of order ''n'', where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of ''S''. It is also said that matrices ''A'' and ''B'' are congruent.  If ''A'' is the coefficient matrix of some quadratic form of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''B'' is the matrix for the same form after the change of basis defined by ''S''.

A symmetric matrix ''A'' can always be transformed in this way into a [[diagonal matrix]] ''D'' which has only entries 0, +1 and −1 along the diagonal. Sylvester's law of inertia states that the number of diagonal entries of each kind is an invariant of ''A'', i.e. it does not depend on the matrix ''S'' used.

The number of +1s, denoted ''n''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the '''positive index of inertia''' of ''A'', and the number of −1s, denoted ''n''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the '''negative index of inertia'''. The number of 0s, denoted ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the dimension of the [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of ''A'', and also the corank of ''A''.  These numbers satisfy an obvious relation

: &lt;math&gt; n_0+n_{+}+n_{-}=n.&lt;/math&gt;

The difference {{nowrap|1=sign(''A'') = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;}} is usually called the '''signature''' of ''A''.  (However, some authors use that term for the triple {{nowrap|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;)}} consisting of the corank and the positive and negative indices of inertia of ''A''; for a non-degenerate form of a given dimension these are equivalent data, but in general the triple yields more data.)

If the matrix ''A'' has the property that every principal upper left {{nowrap|''k'' × ''k''}} [[minor (determinant)|minor]] ''Δ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is non-zero then the negative index of inertia is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta_0=1, \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_n=\det A. &lt;/math&gt;

==Statement in terms of eigenvalues==
The law can also be stated as follows: two symmetric square matrices of the same size have the same number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues if and only if they are congruent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrell|first=James B.|title=Groups, Matrices, and Vector Spaces: A Group Theoretic Approach to Linear Algebra|date=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-79428-0|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;math&gt;S^{\prime}=ASA^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; non-singular).

The positive and negative indices of a symmetric matrix ''A'' are also the number of positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A''.  Any symmetric real matrix ''A'' has an [[eigendecomposition]] of the form ''QEQ''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; where ''E'' is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of ''A'', and ''Q'' is an [[orthonormal]] square matrix containing the eigenvectors.  The matrix ''E'' can be written ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''WDW''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; where ''D'' is diagonal with entries&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;+1, or&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, and ''W'' is diagonal with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;√|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt;|. The matrix ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''QW'' transforms ''D'' to&amp;nbsp;''A''.

== Law of inertia for quadratic forms ==
In the context of [[quadratic form]]s, a real quadratic form ''Q'' in ''n'' variables (or on an ''n''-dimensional real vector space) can by a suitable change of basis (by non-singular linear transformation from x to y) be brought to the diagonal form

: &lt;math&gt; Q(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;

with each ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1}. Sylvester's law of inertia states that the number of coefficients of a given sign is an invariant of ''Q'', i.e., does not depend on a particular choice of diagonalizing basis. Expressed geometrically, the law of inertia says that all maximal subspaces on which the restriction of the quadratic form is [[definite bilinear form|positive definite]] (respectively, negative definite) have the same [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]. These dimensions are the positive and negative indices of inertia.

==Generalizations==
Sylvester's law of inertia is also valid if ''A'' and ''B'' have complex entries. In this case, it is said that ''A'' and ''B'' are *-congruent if and only if there exists a non-singular complex matrix ''S'' such that {{nowrap|1=''B'' = ''SAS''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

In the complex scenario, a way to state Sylvester's law of inertia is that if ''A'' and ''B'' are [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]], then ''A'' and ''B'' are *-congruent if and only if they have the same inertia. A theorem due to Ikramov generalizes the law of inertia to any [[normal matrices]] ''A'' and ''B'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ikramov|first1=Kh. D.|title=On the inertia law for normal matrices|journal=Doklady Mathematics|date=2001|volume=64|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[normal matrices]], then ''A'' and ''B'' are congruent if and only if they have the same number of eigenvalues on each open ray from the origin in the complex plane.

'''Symmetry in the Quran''' is the belief held by some [[Muslim]]s, that the word and verse structure of the [[Quran]] exhibits such complicated [[symmetry]] that it could be neither [[Randomness|random placements]], nor the intentional work of man, but rather  proof of "the will of God".&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Profile of Holy Quran and Symmetry of Makki and Madni Surras, Muhammad Khyzer Bin Dost &amp; Munir Ahmad Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences Vol.1 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of such symmetry. Using a program called QuranCode &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/heliwave/QuranCode|title=QuranCode is a numerical and similarity research tool for the ever-revealing Book (القرءان الكريم) which is Readable (قرءان) despite being encrypted. |first=Ali |last=Adams |date=9 January 2018|publisher=|via=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other analysis programs, scholars have found many patterns.

An example is that [[Al-Insan|chapter 76, called Al-Insan]], has 247 words, and three mentions of the word silver. The middle word of the chapter is word number 124, which is the word "silver". It is in a verse that is the middle verse of the chapter (verse 16 of 31), and it is the third of five words of the verse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7ameem.com/news.php?id=649&amp;catID=4|title=Numerical Analysis of Holy Quran: Silver in Surat AlInsan|website=www.7ameem.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this symmetry is caused by the [[19 (number)#Islam|significance of the number 19 in Islam]]. It is claimed that if all the numbers mentioned in the Quran are added up, their sum is 162,146, which is 19 times 6534; That there are 114 (19 times 6) [[Surah]]s; that [[Muhammad's first revelation]] consists of a verse that has 19 words and 76 (4 times 19) letters.&lt;ref&gt;The Qurʼan: An Encyclopedia, edited by Oliver Leaman, page 465&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symmetry in Quranic linguistics ==
Another aspect of the Quran's symmetry, which was discovered using [[Linguistics|linguistic]] computer searching [[algorithm]]s (Quran Corpus, an [[open-source software]]), includes the number of times certain words and their forms are used in the whole Quran. Some of these symmetrical patterns include:

*Muslims [[Salah|pray 5 times every day]]. The word 'prayers' (صلوات) is used in the Quran exactly 5 times: [[Al-Baqara|2]]:157, 2:238, [[At-Tawba|9]]:99, [[Al-Hajj|22]]:40, and [[Al-Mu'minoon|23]]:9.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
*There are 12 months in a year. The word ‘month’ and all its forms are used in the Quran exactly 12 times: 2:185:1, 2:185:16, [[Saba (surah)|34]]:12:4, 34:12:6, 2:194:1, 2:194:3, [[Al-Qadr (surah)|97]]:3, 2:217, 9:36, [[Al-Ahqaf|46]]:15, [[Al-Ma'ida|5]]:2 and 5:97.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
*The Quran says there are [[seven heavens]] above us, sometimes described as seven layers (23:17). We are in the lowest of these layers (دنيا), so the Quran is basically saying that there are six layers "above" the one we are in. The phrase ‘seven heavens’ is used in the whole Quran exactly seven times: 2:29, [[Fussilat|41]]:12, [[At-Talaq|65]]:12, [[Al-Mulk|67]]:3, [[Nuh (surah)|71]]:15, [[Al-Isra|17]]:44, and 23:86. {{fact|date=January 2017}}
*Muslims [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] around the [[Qibla]], which is the [[Kaaba]], seven times during pilgrimage. The word ‘Qibla’ is used in the whole Quran exactly seven times: 2:142:8, 2:143:15, 2:144:8, 2:145:10, 2:145:14, 2:145:18, and [[Yunus (surah)|10]]:87:12.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11941">In computing, '''tapered floating point''' ('''TFP''') refers to a format similar to [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]], but with variable-sized entries for the [[significand]] and [[exponent]] instead of the fixed-length entries found in normal floating-point formats. In addition to this, tapered floating-point formats provide a fixed-size pointer entry indicating the number of digits in the exponent entry. The number of digits of the significand entry (including the sign) results from the difference of the fixed total length minus the length of the exponent and pointer entries.&lt;ref name="Zehendner_2008"/&gt;

== History ==

{{anchor|Leveling}}The tapered floating-point scheme was first proposed by [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]] of [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1971,&lt;ref name="Morris_1971"/&gt; and refined with ''leveling'' by Masao Iri and Shouichi Matsui of [[University of Tokyo]] in 1981,&lt;ref name="Matsui_1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Higham_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehendner_2008"/&gt; and by Hozumi Hamada of [[Hitachi, Ltd.]]&lt;ref name="Hamada_1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamada_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes_2009"/&gt;

Alan Feldstein of [[Arizona State University]] and Peter Turner&lt;ref name="Feldstein_2006"/&gt; of [[Clarkson University]] described a tapered scheme resembling a conventional floating-point system except for the overflow or underflow conditions.&lt;ref name="Hayes_2009"/&gt;

In 2013, [[John Gustafson (scientist)|John Gustafson]] proposed the [[Unum (number format)|Unum]] number system, a variant of tapered floating-point arithmetic with an ''exact'' bit added to the representation and some [[interval arithmetic|interval]] interpretation to the non-exact values.&lt;ref name="Gustafson_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muller_2016"/&gt;

The '''''New York Journal of Mathematics''''' is a peer-reviewed journal focusing on [[algebra]], [[analysis]], [[geometry]] and [[topology]]. Its editorial board, {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, consists of 17 university-affiliated scholars in addition to the Editor-in-chief. Articles in the ''New York Journal of Mathematics'' are published entirely electronically (on the World Wide Web). The journal uses the [[Open_access#Subsidized_open_access_publications|diamond open access model]]—that is, its full content is available to anyone via the Internet, without a subscription or fee.

==History==
The journal was founded in 1994 by Mark Steinberger who cited a 1993 letter by John Franks as inspiration. At the time of its launch, the ''New York Journal of Mathematics'' was the "first electronic general mathematics journal", predating the online versions of both ''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]'' and the journals in ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]''.&lt;ref name="ams" /&gt; It was published by the [[State University of New York at Albany]] where Steinberger had been a professor since 1987.

Steinberger justified the stylistic choices of the journal by writing, "Some proponents of electronic publication have urged changes in style, citing the low price of disk space as a rationale for publishing articles more loquacious than those commonly acceptable in a print medium. We decided to eschew this route, on the grounds that the perceived quality of our publications would be reduced. We feel it is important to follow the standards of consensus in the field. If these standards change in the future, we will change
with them."&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199601/steinberger.pdf |title=Electronic Mathematics Journals |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=Mark Steinberger |authorlink= |date=January 1996 |format=PDF |work=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=43|number=1 |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |pages=13–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''New York Journal of Mathematics'' was first published, it was made available via [[FTP]] and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] for users without a web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2rgAAAAMAA|title=Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters, and Academic Discussion Lists|page=112|year=1994|publisher=Association of Research Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers, typeset in [[TeX]], were originally downloadable in the [[PostScript]] format. [[PDF]] support was added in 1996.&lt;ref name="jep"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0004.208?view=text;rgn=main|first=Mark|last=Steinberger|title=The Demands on Electronic Journals in the Mathematical Sciences|journal=Journal of Electronic Publishing|year=1998|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To incorporate hyperlinks within documents, the journal leveraged software that had been developed for the [[arXiv]] preprint server.&lt;ref name="ams" /&gt;

In 1998, the journal began including links to relevant reviews on [[MathSciNet]] with its published articles.&lt;ref name="jep" /&gt; It is listed in the Journals section of [[The Electronic Library of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/index.html |title=Mathematical Journals |accessdate=2007-06-25 |work=The Electronic Library of Mathematics| quote=Our papers are presented in a variety of formats, including pdf with extensive internal cross-reference links for ease of electronic browsing, as well as external links from the bibliographic entries to the reviews in [[MathSciNet]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH|Zentralblatt]]. We also offer full text indexing, listserv lists for announcement of new papers, links to reviews and related works, and archives of supporting materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles from 2010 and later are available on [[Web of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noncommutativeanalysis.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/reflections-on-the-new-york-journal-of-mathematics/|author=Orr Shalit|title=Reflections on the New York Journal of Mathematics|date=2012-10-22|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper on the [[variability hypothesis]] by [[Ted Hill (mathematician)|Theodore Hill]] and [[Sergei Tabachnikov]] was accepted and retracted by ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' and later the ''New York Journal of Mathematics''. There was some controversy over the mathematical model, the peer-review process, and the lack of an official retraction notice from the ''NYJM''.&lt;ref name="TheScientist"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/a-twice-retracted-paper-on-sex-differences-ignites-debate-64873 |title=A Twice-Retracted Paper on Sex Differences Ignites Debate |last=Azvolinsky |first=Anna |date=2018-09-27 |website=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 2017, the journal had an [[impact factor]] of 0.551 and a [[Mathematical Citation Quotient]] of 0.56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-NEW-YORK-J-MATH.shtml|title=New York Journal of Mathematics Impact Factor|publisher=Sci Journal|year=2017|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/mrcit/journal.html?groupId=3798&amp;max_citing_year=2017&amp;min_citing_year=2017|title=Citations to New York J. Math|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2017|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a professional conference presentation, Renzo Piccinini said "An example of what I consider a good electronic journal is the New York Journal of Mathematics; this is a refereed journal--with referees not in the editor's board—with high quality papers and very fast publication time; last, but not least, it is free!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siba2.unile.it/sinm/interventi/piccinini.htm |title=L'editoria elettronica per le scienze matematiche |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=Renzo Piccinini |authorlink=  |date=30 September 1997 |work=Sistema Informativo Nazionale Per La Matematica (Seminario III) |publisher=Università degli Studi di Lecce  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Story of Maths''''' is a four-part British [[television]] series outlining aspects of the [[history of mathematics]]. It was a co-production between the [[Open University]] and the [[BBC]] and aired in October 2008 on [[BBC Four]]. The material was written and presented by [[University of Oxford]] professor [[Marcus du Sautoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/audio/2008/oct/13/science-weekly-podcast Guardian interview]&lt;/ref&gt; The consultants were the Open University academics [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]], professor [[Jeremy Gray]] and June Barrow-Green. Kim Duke is credited as series producer.&lt;ref name = Ep4&gt;''To Infinity and Beyond'' 27 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt;

The series comprised four programmes respectively titled: ''The Language of the Universe''; ''The Genius of the East''; ''The Frontiers of Space''; and'' To Infinity and Beyond''. Du Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven [[Riemann hypothesis]], a 150-year-old problem for whose solution the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has offered a $1,000,000 prize. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the world's science, technology, and culture.

He starts his journey in [[Egyptian mathematics|ancient Egypt]] and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. Between he travels through [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylon]], [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], and the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|medieval Middle East]]. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians.

=="The Language of the Universe"==
In this opening programme Marcus du Sautoy looks at how important and fundamental mathematics is to our lives before looking at the mathematics of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].

Du Sautoy commences in [[Egyptian mathematics|Egypt]] where recording the patterns of the seasons and in particular the flooding of the [[Nile]] was essential to their economy. There was a need to solve practical problems such as land area for taxation purposes.&lt;ref name= Ep1&gt;BBC Four; ''The Language of the Universe;'' 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm 6 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Du Sautoy discovers the use of a decimal system based on the fingers on the hands, the unusual method for multiplication and division. He examines the [[Rhind Papyrus]], the [[Moscow Papyrus]] and explores their understanding of binary numbers, fractions and solid shapes.

He then travels to [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylon]] and discovered that the way we tell the time today is based on the [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian 60 base number system]]. So because of the Babylonians we have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. He then shows how the Babylonians used [[quadratic equation]]s to measure their land. He deals briefly with [[Plimpton 322]].

In Greece, the home of ancient [[Greek mathematics]], he looks at the contributions of some of its greatest and well known mathematicians including [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Euclid]], and [[Archimedes]], who are some of the people who are credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today. A controversial figure, Pythagoras’ teachings were considered suspect and his followers seen as social outcasts and a little be strange and not in the norm. There is a legend going around that one of his followers, [[Hippasus]], was drowned when he announced his discovery of [[irrational number]]s. As well as his work on the properties of right angled triangles, Pythagoras developed another important theory after observing musical instruments. He discovered that the intervals between harmonious musical notes are always in whole number intervals.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-language-the-universe The Language of the Universe]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It deals briefly with [[Hypatia of Alexandria]].

=="The Genius of the East"==
With the decline of ancient Greece, the development of maths stagnated in Europe. However the progress of mathematics continued in the East. Du Sautoy describes both the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese use of maths]] in [[History of science and technology in China|engineering projects]] and their belief in the mystical powers of numbers. He mentions [[Qin Jiushao]].

He describes [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]]’ invention of [[trigonometry]]; their introduction of a symbol for the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and their contribution to the new concepts of [[infinity]] and [[negative number]]s. It shows [[Gwalior Fort]] where zero is inscribed on its walls. It mentions the work of [[Brahmagupta]] and [[Bhāskara II]] on the subject of zero. He mentions [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] and [[Aryabhata]] and illustrates the - historically first exact - [[Madhava of Sangamagrama#The value of π (pi)|formula for calculating the π (pi)]].&lt;ref name="BBC_2008"&gt;[http://vimeo.com/74859005 BBC documentary "The Story of Maths", second part], showing a visualization of the historically first exact formula, starting at 35 min and 20 sec into the second part of the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Sautoy then considers [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|the Middle East]]: the invention of the new language of [[algebra]] and the evolution of a solution to [[Cubic function|cubic equations]]. He talks about the [[House of Wisdom]] with [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] and he visits [[University of Al-Karaouine]]. He mentions [[Omar Khayyám]].

Finally he examines the spread of [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Eastern knowledge to the West]] through mathematicians such as [[Leonardo Fibonacci]], famous for the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-genius-the-east The Genius of the East]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]].

From the seventeenth century, Europe replaced the Middle East as the engine house of mathematical ideas. Du Sautoy visits [[Urbino]] to introduce [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] using mathematician and artist,  [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.&lt;ref name = Ep3&gt;''The Frontiers of Space'' 20 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Sautoy  proceeds to describes [[René Descartes]] realisation that it was possible to describe curved lines as equations and thus link algebra and geometry. He talks with [[Henk J. M. Bos]] about Descartes. He shows how one of [[Pierre de Fermat]]’s theorems is now the basis for the codes that protect credit card transactions on the internet. He describes Isaac Newton’s development of math and physics crucial to understanding the behaviour of moving objects in engineering. He covers the [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy]] and the [[Bernoulli family]]. He further covers [[Leonhard Euler]], the father of topology, and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' invention of a new way of handling equations, modular arithmetic. He mentions [[János Bolyai]].

The further contribution of Gauss to our understanding of how [[prime numbers]] are distributed is covered thus providing the platform for [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s theories on prime numbers. In addition Riemann worked on the properties of objects, which he saw as manifolds that could exist in multi-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-frontiers-space The Frontiers of Space]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=="To Infinity and Beyond"==

===Hilbert's first problem===
The final episode considers the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. On 8 August 1900 [[David Hilbert]] gave a historic talk at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. Hilbert posed [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three then unsolved problems]] in mathematics which he believed were of the most immediate importance. Hilbert succeeded in setting the agenda for 20thC mathematics and the programme commenced with [[Hilbert's first problem]].

[[Georg Cantor]] considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... ∞ which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... ∞. Cantor showed that these two infinite sets of numbers actually had the same size as it was possible to pair each number up; 1 - 10, 2 - 20, 3 - 30 ... etc.

If fractions now are considered there are an infinite number of fractions between any of the two whole numbers, suggesting that the infinity of fractions is bigger than the infinity of whole numbers. Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; 2 - &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; 3 - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... etc. through to ∞; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size.

But when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.

However, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals? Cantor believed, in what became known as the [[Continuum Hypothesis]], that there is no such set. This would be the first problem listed by Hilbert.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Poincaré conjecture===
Next Marcus discusses [[Henri Poincaré]]'s work on the discipline of 'Bendy geometry'. If two shapes can be moulded or morphed to each other's shape then they have the same topology. Poincaré was able to identify all possible two-dimensional topological surfaces; however in 1904 he came up with a topological problem, the [[Poincaré conjecture]], that he could not solve; namely what are all the possible shapes for a 3D universe.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

According to the programme, the [[Solution of the Poincaré conjecture|question was solved]] in 2002 by [[Grigori Perelman]] who linked the problem to a different area of mathematics. Perelman looked at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape. This enabled him to find all the ways that 3D space could be wrapped up in higher dimensions.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===David Hilbert===
The achievements of David Hilbert were now considered. In addition to [[Hilbert's problems]], [[Hilbert space]], Hilbert Classification and the Hilbert Inequality, du Sautoy highlights Hilbert's early work on equations as marking him out as a mathematician able to think in new ways. Hilbert showed that, while there were an infinity of equations, these equations could be constructed from a finite number of building block like sets. Hilbert could not construct that list of sets; he simply proved that it existed. In effect Hilbert had created a new more abstract style of Mathematics.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's second problem===
For 30 years Hilbert believed that mathematics was a universal language powerful enough to unlock all the truths and solve each of his 23 Problems. Yet, even as Hilbert was stating ''We must know, we will know'', [[Kurt Gödel]] had shattered this belief; he had  formulated the [[Incompleteness Theorem]] based on his study of [[Hilbert's second problem]]:

:''This statement cannot be proved''

Using a [[Gödel's encoding|code based on prime numbers]], Gödel was able to transform the above into a pure statement of arithmetic. Logically, the above cannot be false and hence Gödel had discovered the existence of mathematical statements that were true but were incapable of being proved.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's first problem revisited===
In 1950s American mathematician [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] took up the challenge of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which asks "is there is or isn't there an infinite set of number bigger than the set of whole numbers but smaller than the set of all decimals". Cohen found that there existed two equally consistent mathematical worlds. In one world the Hypothesis was true and there did not exist such a set. Yet there existed a mutually exclusive but equally consistent mathematical proof that Hypothesis was false and there was such a set. Cohen would subsequently work on [[Hilbert's eighth problem]], the [[Riemann hypothesis]], although without the success of his earlier work.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's tenth problem===
[[Hilbert's tenth problem]] asked if there was some universal method that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not. The growing belief was that no so such method was possible yet the question remained, how could you prove that, no matter how ingenious you were, you would never come up with such a method. He mentions [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]]. To answer this [[Julia Robinson]], who created the [[Julia Robinson#Hilbert's tenth problem|Robinson Hypothesis]] which stated that to show that there was no such method all you had to do was cook up one equation whose solutions were a very specific set of numbers: The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially yet still be captured by the equations at the heart of Hilbert's problem. Robinson was unable to find this set. This part of the solution fell to [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] who saw how to capture the [[Fibonacci sequence]] using the equations at the heart of Hilbert's tenth.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Algebraic geometry===
The final section briefly covers [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Évariste Galois]] had refined a new language for mathematics. Galois believed  mathematics should be the study of structure as opposed to number and shape. Galois had discovered new techniques to tell whether certain equations could have solutions or not. The symmetry of certain geometric objects was the key. Galois' work was picked up by [[André Weil]] who built algebraic geometry, a whole new language. Weil's work connected [[number theory]], algebra, topology and geometry.

Finally du Sautoy mentions Weil's part in the creation of the fictional mathematician [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] and another contributor to Bourbaki's output - [[Alexander Grothendieck]].&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

'''Thomas Bedwell''' (died April 1595) was an English mathematician and military engineer.

Bedwell matriculated as a sizar of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in November 1562. He became a scholar in the same year; in 1566–7 he took the degree of B.A.; he was subsequently elected fellow; and in 1570 commenced M.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BDWL562T|name=Bedwell, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the office of keeper of the ordnance stores in the Tower. He is said to have been the first to project 'the bringing of the waters of the [[River Lea|Lea]] from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] to [[London]].' In conjunction with [[Frederico Genebelli]] he was employed as a military engineer in strengthening the works at [[Tilbury]] and [[Gravesend, Hertfordshire|Gravesend]] at the time of the [[Spanish Armada]]. He died in April 1595.

Thomas Bedwell was uncle of [[William Bedwell]], the Arabic scholar, who speaks of him as 'our English Tycho.' The two are sometimes confounded, chiefly, it would appear, on account of an ambiguity on the title-page of the first of two works published by the nephew in explanation of a 'ruler' or mesolabium architectonicum which the uncle had devised to facilitate carpenters' calculations.&lt;ref&gt;See the Macclesfield collection of ''Corresp. of Scient. Men'', Oxford, 1841, p.1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
