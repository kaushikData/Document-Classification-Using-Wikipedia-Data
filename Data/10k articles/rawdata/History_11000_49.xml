'''Aarno Henrik Maliniemi''' (surname until 1930 ''Malin''; 9 May 1892 in [[Oulu]] &amp;ndash; 8 October 1972 in [[Helsinki]]), was a Finnish historian, professor in church history at [[Helsinki University]] 1945-1960.

Maliniemi had large knowledge in Medieval church. He has also studied early Finnish literature, and he has been [[editing|editor]] for publications on sources and bibliographies.

Maliniemi was entitled ''doctor honoris causa'' by [[University of Uppsala]] in 1952 and by [[University of St Andrews]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otavan Iso tietosanakirja]] (Encyclopaedia Fennica) 5, page 1278; Helsinki: Otava, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Skirej''' (also transcribed '''Skiredj''') or '''Abu-l-Abbas Ahmed ibn al-Iyyashi Sukayrij al-Khazraji Al-Ansari al-Fasi''' (1878-1944) was a well known Moroccan Sufi scholar and judge.&lt;ref&gt;Temsamani, Abdelaziz Khalouk, "Hayât al-qâdî Ahmad Skîrj wa âthâruhu" (Vie et œuvre d'Ahmed Skirej:1878-1944), ''Majallat dâr an-niyâba''  9 (1986), pp. 49-57&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a great number of books, but is especially well known for his voluminous work on the companions of [[Ahmad al-Tijani|Sidi Ahmad al-Tijani]]: ''Kitab kashf al-Hijab ámman talaaqa bi-Shaykh Tijani mina-l As'hab'' (Raising the veil of the companions who encountered Sheikh Tijani).

{{History of war}}
'''Ancient warfare''' is [[war]] as conducted from the beginnings of [[recorded history]] to the end of the [[ancient period]]. In [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]], the end of antiquity is often equated with the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] in 476 AD, the wars of the Eastern Roman Empire on its Southwestern Asian and North African borders, and the beginnings of the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century. In [[China]], it can also be seen as ending with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north in the 5th century and the beginning of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 618. In [[Indian subcontinent|India]], the ancient period ends with the decline of the [[Gupta Empire]] (6th century) and the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests there]] from the 8th century. In [[Japan]], the ancient period can be taken to end with the rise of [[feudalism]] in the [[Kamakura period]] in the 12–13th century.

The difference between [[Prehistoric warfare|prehistoric]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], [[State (polity)|states]] produced sufficient agricultural surplus so that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.

These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. The findings at the site of [[Nataruk]] in [[Turkana County|Turkana]], Kenya, have been interpreted as evidence of inter-group conflict and warfare in antiquity,&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16477|journal = Nature|pages = 394–98|volume = 529|issue = 7586|doi = 10.1038/nature16477|first = M.

Maillo|last8 = Fernandez|first9 = C.|last9 = Kiarie|pmid=26791728|year=2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.529..394L}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this interpretation has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojanowski|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Seidel|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Fulginiti|first3=Laura C.|last4=Johnson|first4=Kent M.|last5=Buikstra|first5=Jane E.|title=Contesting the massacre at Nataruk|journal=Nature|volume=539|issue=7630|doi=10.1038/nature19778|pmid=27882979|pages=E8–E10|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early armies in [[Egypt]] and China followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.
Infantry were at this time the dominant form of war, partially because the camel saddle and the stirrup were not yet invented. This infantry would be divided into ranged and shock, with shock infantry either charging to cause penetration of the enemy line or holding their own. These forces would ideally be combined, thus presenting your opponent with a dilemma: group your forces and leave them vulnerable to ranged, or spread them out and make them vulnerable to shock. This balance would eventually change as technology allowed for chariots, cavalry, and artillery to play an active role on the field.

No clear line can be drawn between ancient and [[medieval warfare]]. The characteristic properties of medieval warfare, notably [[heavy cavalry]] and [[Medieval siege weaponry|siege engines]] such as the [[trebuchet]] were first introduced in [[Late Antiquity]]. The main division within the ancient period is rather at the beginning [[Iron Age]] with the introduction of [[cavalry]] (resulting in the decline of [[chariot warfare]]), of [[naval warfare]] ([[Sea Peoples]]), and the development of an industry  based on [[ferrous metallurgy]] which allowed for the mass production of metal weapons and thus the equipment of large standing armies.
The first military power to profit from these innovations was the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], which achieved a [[List of largest empires#Ancient empires|hitherto unseen]] extent of centralized control, the first "[[world power]]" to extend over the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).

== Chariots ==
{{main article|Chariot}}
As states grew in size, speed of movement became crucial because central power could not hold if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the [[chariot]] which became used in the [[Middle East]] from around 1800 BC. First pulled by [[oxen]] and [[donkey]]s, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. Improvements in the ability to train [[horse]]s soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, possibly as early as 2100 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuznetsov | first1 = P.F. | year = 2006 | title = The emergence of Bronze Age chariots in eastern Europe | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 80 | issue = 309| pages = 638–45 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00094096}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their greater speed and power made chariots even more efficient. The major limitation of the use of chariots is terrain; while very mobile on flat, hard, open ground, this is lost on any sort of rough ground, even sparse trees or bushes, small ravines or streams, or marsh, where they are surpassed in maneuverability by common foot soldiers, and later by [[cavalry]].

The power of the chariot as a device both of transportation and of battle became the central weapon of the peoples of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The typical chariot was worked by two men: one would be a bowman and fire at the enemy forces, while the other would control the vehicle. Over time, chariots carrying up to five warriors were developed. The effectiveness of these vehicles is still somewhat in doubt. In [[China]], [[Chariot (Ancient China)|their chariots]] became the central weapon of the [[Shang dynasty]], allowing them to unify a great area.

Although chariots have been compared to modern-day [[tanks]] in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e., [[shock attack]]s, this is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Alan B.|title=A Companion to Ancient Egyp|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-5598-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RK2pLin2sPAC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20chariots%20tanks&amp;f=false|page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Drews|title=The end of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C|year=1995|edition=new|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02591-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20tank&amp;f=false|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, required a level terrain while tanks are all-terrain vehicles, and thus not suitable for use in the way modern tanks have been used as a physical shock force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littauer|first=M.A.|title=Wheeled vehicles and ridden animals in the ancient Near East|year=1979|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-05953-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=ancient+near+east+chariots++tanks#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20near%20east%20chariots%20%20tanks&amp;f=false|author2=J.

Because tightly packed infantry were the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] during the battle as well as for mutual protection, a force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to charge the chariots could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them.

From a tactical standpoint this put any force facing chariots on the horns of dilemma, making chariots indispensable to armies of the day. Chariots, however, were complicated pieces of hardware that required specialized craftsmen to maintain them. Such services, therefore, made chariots expensive to own. When chariots were owned by individuals within a society, it tended to give rise to a warrior class of specialists and a [[feudal system]] (an example of which can be seen in [[Homer]]'s [[The Iliad]]). Where chariots were publicly owned, they helped in the maintenance and establishment of a strong central government, e.g., the [[New Kingdom|New Egyptian Kingdom]]. Chariot usage peaked in the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC, which was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000 chariots.&lt;ref name="Parragon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Aaron Ralby|title=Atlas of Military History|year=2013|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1|pages=54–55|chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BCE: Clash of Empires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naval warfare ==
{{main article|Naval warfare}}
Naval warfare in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] can be traced back to the third millennium BC Mediterranean as evidence of paintings on Cyclades and models of ships were being made across the Aegean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays and Reflections: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World: Myths and Realities|last=Lazenby|first=J.F.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships in this era have been said to have served as both ordinary transportation and trade vessels as well as having some military and warfare applications. These early sea vessels would have been propelled by both [[oar]] and [[sail]], but since the [[Mediterranean]] is known for its inconsistent weather patterns, the oar would have most likely been the primary means of propulsion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first documented, physical evidence of a naval battle is found in the relief painting located in the temple of Medinet Habu, near Luxor, Egypt. This relief painting depicts the victory of Ramses III over the 'Sea-Peoples' at the Nile river delta in the early twelfth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays and Reflections: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World: Myths and Realities.|last=Lazenby|first=J.F.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 'Sea-Peoples' are originally believed to be of Philistine and Phoenician descent, while there is speculation that there could be some Greek influence in their sea-faring. While the relief painting at the Temple of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] is said to be the first physical documentation of naval warfare, there are earlier records that indicate that the concept and practice of sea-faring battles sprouted up as early as 2550 BC under the Egyptian Pharaoh Sahue who reportedly used transport vessels to escort his armies to foreign shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ancient Mariners: Seafarers and Sea Fighters of the Mediterranean in Ancient Times.|last=Casson|first=Lionel|publisher=Brett-Macmillan, Ltd.|year=1959|isbn=|location=New York|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even further evidence from earlier sources that illustrate sea faring and military action around the Nile Delta during the early dynastic period in Egypt following into the reign of Ramses II &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egyptian Warfare and Weapons|last=Shaw|first=Ian|publisher=Shire Publications, Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=|location=Buckinghamshire, U.K.|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the victory of Ramses III over the 'Sea-Peoples', Egypt, as a sovereign state, did not have access to kind of timber needed to manufacture seafaring vessels and warships alike on a large scale. Instead of importing mass amounts of timber in order to build warships, Egyptian naval architects and early engineers began to convert the common river-going ship by reconfiguring the size of the ship while also adding heavy trees for longitudinal support of the hull on the open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stieglitz|first=Robert R.|date=1984|title=Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume= 47| issue =  3|pages=136–37|jstor=3209914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This newly theorized concept of rearranging and reconfiguring the common Egyptian river boat was held in high esteem and largely contributed to the victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the 'Sea-Peoples' in the Nile river delta as depicted in the relief painting at Medinet Habu. The relief shows in great detail how fighting was actually conducted in a naval battle in this time period. The Relief shows Egyptian wars ships consisting of over twenty rows of oarsmen along with infantry troops and archers fighting in apparent hand-to-hand combat with the opposing naval force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egyptian Warfare and Weapons|last=Shaw|first=Ian|publisher=Shire Publications, Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=|location=Buckinghamshire, U.K.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This begs the theory that there was no actual naval weaponry developed at this time but rather reliant upon maneuvering tactics and strategy in order to engage with infantry troops.

=== The Trireme ===

Amongst the great innovations of naval warfare in the Ancient world there are few that can surpass the Trireme style warship in terms of efficiency, strategy, and over all effectiveness. The first depiction of this 'longship' style vessel can be found in Homer's the ''Iliad'' as means of transport of men armed men and supplies to areas of conflict across the seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were said to have consisted of two separate levels that could have help up to 60 men per level all operating oars in unison to propel the ship. The upper level of oarsmen would sit in single-file fashion, pulling their oars through what is called a topwale or some sort of oarport; while the men in the lower rows would sit in the ships' hold also rowing through lower oarports.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that each oar throughout the ship would be made in length proportionate the physique of an average Greek man.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|thumb|reconstruction of ancient Greek Trireme]]
Manned crews for these massive warships would have been quite impressive, but accounts vary in actual numbers of men from source to source. [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] was a Greek historian in the fourth century BC who through his accounts, said that these Triremes would consist of at least two-hundred men manning all positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these massive crews, these ships were able to work at maximum capacity and efficiency in regards to speed, navigation, and transport. While these ships were built for maximum efficiency, there is room for debate about the conditions and space aboard the ship itself. It is estimated that out of the 200 man crew, around 170 of those men would have been oarsmen with respective positions below deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oarsmen below deck would sit on thwarts and kept their personal storage items beneath them, reassuring the theory that these ships would be very crowded with little room for anything other than operational functions.

What exactly these Greek triremes were capable of in battle is debated. There are various different accounts that lay down foundations of what equipment was used and how these ships engaged in combat. The main military applications of Greek Triremes, besides the transport of troops and supplies, would be the advantages of ramming tactics. developments and innovations of the Greek Trireme evolved over time, especially in respects to ramming tactics. Naval architects during this time saw fit to bring about full effectiveness and damaging power to these ships. By doing this, the amount of manpower would stay consistent, i.e. keeping the same amount of rowing power but shortening the length of the ship to condense the ramming power while keeping speed and agility consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new ideology of warfare and naval tactics would prove to be prudent to the overall military applications of the Trireme, and soon would become the principal combative strategy of the Greek navy and other navies alike.

The Greek Trireme would soon after its appearance in the Aegean, become the standard warship throughout the mediterranean as sovereign states such as Egypt and even the Persian Empire would adopt the design of these ships and apply them to their own military applications. One major attraction of the Greek design would be its efficient ramming capability but also its ability to travel long distances at fair speeds. One account from Athenian soldier and historian Xenophon, describes the voyage of Athenian fleet commander Iphicrates through unfriendly waters and the strategy he used combined with the sheer sailing power of the Trireme. &lt;blockquote&gt;"He proceeded with his journey and at the same time made all the necessary preparations for action, at the outset leaving his main sails behind as if he was expecting an engagement. In addition, even if there was a following wind he used his small [boat] sails little, but progressed by oar [instead, presumably, of using main sails and boat sails when the wind was favourable]. Thus he both improved the fitness of his men and achieved a higher speed for his ships".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison, Coates, Rankov|first=J.S., J.F., N.B,|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This primary source account can be interpreted as a functional and efficient use of the Greek Trireme. Maximizing its speed through rugged and unfriendly seas while also utilizing specific military strategy in order to ensure the most prudent and effective outcome was what led to the success of Trireme across all kinds of empires and civilizations throughout the Mediterranean. The Trireme would later become a vital piece of naval weaponry throughout the Persian Wars, for both the Greeks and the Persian Empire, as well as the base standard for the formation of the Roman Navy.

The [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] were the first to feature large-scale naval operations: not only sophisticated fleet engagements with dozens of [[trireme]]s on each side, but combined land–sea operations. Ships in the ancient world could operate only on the relatively quiet waters of seas and rivers; the oceans were off limits. Navies were almost always used as auxiliaries to land forces, often essential to bringing them supplies. They would rarely strike out on their own. With only limited-range weapons, naval galleys would often attempt to ram their opponents with their reinforced bow to cause damage or sink the enemy warships which often caused the two ships to become joined together, and initiated a boarding battle. Only occasionally was a decisive naval battle fought, such as the [[Battle of Lade]] in which a Persian navy destroyed the Greek navy.

== Tactics and weapons ==

=== Strategy ===
Ancient strategy focused broadly on the twin goals of convincing the enemy that continued war was more costly than submitting, and of making the most gain possible from war.

Forcing the enemy to submit generally consisted of defeating their army in the field. Once the enemy force was routed, the threat of siege, civilian deaths, and the like often forced the enemy to the bargaining table. However, this goal could be accomplished by other means. Burning enemy fields would force the choice of surrendering or fighting a [[pitched battle]]. Waiting an enemy out until their army had to disband due to the beginning of the harvest season or running out of payment for mercenaries presented an enemy with a similar choice. The exceptional conflicts of the ancient world were when these rules of warfare were violated. The Spartan and Athenian refusal to accept surrender after many years of war and near bankruptcy in the [[Peloponnesian War]] is one such exceptional example, as is the Roman refusal to surrender after the [[Battle of Cannae]].

A more personal goal in war was simple profit. This profit was often monetary, as was the case with the raiding culture of the Gallic tribes. But the profit could be political, as great leaders in war were often rewarded with government office after their success. These strategies often contradict modern common sense as they conflict with what would be best for the states involved in the war.

=== Weapons ===
{{main article|List of ancient weapons}}
Ancient weapons included the [[spear]], the [[atlatl]] with light javelin or similar projectile, the [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow, the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]; [[polearm]]s such as the [[spear]], [[falx]] and [[pilum|javelin]]; hand-to-hand weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[knife|knives]]. [[Catapult]]s, [[siege tower]]s, and [[battering ram]]s were used during [[siege]]s.

There were a wide variety and range of weapons used in the wars and battles of times long past and while it is quite easy to identify a sword or shield and know what purpose it served, even more information can be gained from knowing where said weapon comes from and what material it is made of. Ancient Greece is one of the most looked to and studied periods of time in part due the abundance of surviving information and artifacts and this aspect can also be extended to their weaponry and armor. The Mycenaean left behind a great deal of their weapons and armor which was found in their shaft graves, in ''Arms and Armour of the Greeks'' the swords found within the Mycenaean tombs are quite similar to rapiers being quite slender and measuring in at over three feet in length. It was due to their length and slim design that they were easily broken if struck hard enough. In addition to the rapier swords, smaller yet more durable blades were found along with a few spearheads which often came in at over two feet in length; however, the spearheads were not quite as abundant as other bladed weapons as Snodgrass states that their value and use in war and hunting was too significant to spare for graves. Prior to the Bronze Age the Mycenaean helmets were constructed from crescent shaped sections of wild boar tusk and arranged in horizontal bands that alternated in direction and attached to a soft material.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour of the Greeks|last=Snodgrass|first=A.M.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers’ shields were around four feet tall, if not more, made of ox hide and supported with some type of metal. As we move into the Bronze Age body armor began to appear as the smiths began working with this new metal, bronze helmets also began to make an appearance though the previous helmets made from boars’ tusks still remained in use. It was during this period that two new types of swords made a debut, they were the horned and cruciform swords. The horned sword was dubbed as such from the horn-like appearance of their hand guards and was the preferred weapon for a cutting stroke. The cruciform sword was derived and enhanced from a Minoan dagger with flanges on the hilt with rounded, right angle hand guards is how it is described within ''Arms and Armour'' . Spears continued to remain as the preferred means for a thrusting weapon, but it was during the Palace Period that they developed a socketed base. In earlier periods of Greek history, the bow and arrow was not a favored weapon for war but used primarily in hunting though in the Palace Period archery began to prosper – the arrowheads of both time periods were made of flint, bronze, or obsidian – while the bows of the Palace Period were made of goats’ horn is how Snodgrass depicts the use of archery. From the Palace Period, we move into the Late Period of Mycenae where the weapons became shorter and more suited for use in a work environment rather than in battle and the metal plated armor was no longer being put to use.

Macedon was known more traditionally for having a strong cavalry rather than infantry and during Alexander’s reign the Sarissophori came into being and this was unique Alexander’s time in power. While the cavalry was more prominent the Macedon infantry, made up of the poor and peasant classes, formed into a new and unique branch of the military that was different from the hoplite. These warriors were armed with a huge pike weapon called a sarissa as well as the army being equipped with slings. The slings used almond-shaped bronze bullets that were engraved with either Philip’s or his generals’ name and as for siege warfare the Macedonians used an arrow-firing catapult.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For armor, they were equipped with a metal helmet, greaves, and a shield covered with bronze.

In ''The Archaeology of Weapons'' a broader account of ancient weaponry is taken into account through the investigation of European weapons. Oakeshott believes that at some point between 1500–100 BC that the sword developed from the knife in both Minoan Crete and Celtic Britain and strongly resembles the rapiers. During the Bronze Age in the same general region several other swords were developed: the Hallstatt first appeared during this Age but did not become widely used until the Iron Age, the Carps Tongues, and the Rhone Valley swords. The Hallstatt swords gained prominence during the Iron Age and were a long sword with a rather curious point that was one of three shapes: rounded, a square shape, or similar to a fishtail, and were the preferred weapon for use in a chariot. The Carps Tongues blade were also rather large swords with the edges running parallel for two-thirds of the blade before narrowing to the usually point. The last sword is that of the Rhone Valley and is generally considered more of small sword or an overly large dagger with each hilt uniquely cast in bronze. The pommel of this type of dagger has the ends drawn out into two thin points that curve in towards the blade. Along with Hallstatt swords there were found to be spears, similar to the spearheads found in Mycenae they were quite large at fifteen inches and having a hollow socket however they were unique in that they had a small collar of bronze near where they attached to the shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Weapons|last=Oakeshott|first=Ewart|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within India’s long history there are several different regimes that produced unique weapons. The list of weapons primarily used in India are the battle axe, the bow and arrow, spears, spike, barbed dart, the sword, iron club, javelin, iron arrow, and the scimitar.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour Traditional Weapons of India|last=Jaiwant|first=Paul E.|publisher=Roli and Janssen|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sword type is the katar blade, these are equipped with sword breaking bars and both the shape and size would depend on whether the bearer was cavalry or an infantryman. A curved sword such as the talwar or shamsheer was ideal for a cutting motion delivered from horseback. There were three early iron sword types being the leaf shaped, spoon shaped and the parallel sword each ideal for thrusting and jabbing as opposed to a striking or cutting motion. The Rajputs, Gurkhas, Nagas, and Coorg and Malabar each developed a weapon unique to themselves. The Rajputs wielded the khanda which is a broad and straight sword with a wider point. The Gurkhas had two swords that they preferred to use the kukri, a short sword that angled towards wide tip, and the kora, their historical war sword which was around 60 centimeters with a single edge that was rather narrow near the handler and curving towards the front.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The daos had a blade equal to two feet in length that had a wide and square-like tip and the handle was made of either wood or ivory, these were the weapons that came to popularity for the Nagas. The adya katti was a single edged blade also near two feet long but with no handle and wield by the Coorg and Malabar. In Southern India, the Borobudur and the Veragal, either shaped like a hook or a wavy design, were the swords in use. A rather unique weapon used in India is the Baghnakh which are similar to a knuckle duster and were used to slit the opponent’s throat or belly.

Armor in India can be found dating back to 500 BC and Vedic literature; there are several different types: leather and fabric, scale, brigandine, lamellar, mail, plate, and a combination of mail and plate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In ''Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India'' it is read that the wrastrana, a breast plate, has been in use since prehistoric times though the most popular is the char-aina meaning four mirrors is a coat of mail overlaid with four elaborately designed plates. The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard with a piece of chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while a face plate protected the animal’s face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal.

=== Sieges ===
{{main article|Siege}}
[[File:Ramesseum siege of Dapur.jpg|thumb|The Egyptian [[siege of Dapur]] in the 13th century BC, from [[Ramesseum]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].]]

Siege warfare of the [[ancient Near East]] took place behind walls built of mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. The earliest representations of siege warfare date to the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]], c. 3000 BC, while the first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC showing wheeled siege ladders. [[Assyria]]n palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare. The most common practise of siege warfare was, however, to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving anything but a minor force could seldom be maintained.

Ancient siege warfare varied from each civilization and how each city was defended differently and had to approached with different tactics. One way to ensure an army used all its troops in its siege is shown when its explained how a chariot can be used in a siege, saying that, “During the sieges, the chariots, and mostly in the Neo-Assyrian armies, were surely employed to patrol and protect the flanks and the rear of the besiegers’ lines and camp.” (UF 41 p. 5).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This shows that generals had to find new tactics to incorporate parts of their army that wouldn’t work in the siege, as shown with the chariots on patrol duty and ensuring the army was safe from a flank attack from the enemy army. This strategy ensures that all forces are used and contributing to the battle effort and helping gain victory for them and all pulling their weight as well.

==== Mesopotamia ====
{{main article|Military history of the Assyrian Empire|Military history of Iraq}}

==== Egypt ====
{{main article|Military history of Egypt|Military of ancient Egypt}}
Throughout most of its history, [[ancient Egypt]] was unified under one government. The main military concern for the nation was to keep enemies out. The arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile [[Nile]] river valley. The [[Egyptians]] built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in [[Nubia]] to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.

The first Egyptian soldiers carried a simple armament consisting of a spear with a copper spearhead and a large wooden shield covered by leather hides. A stone mace was also carried in the Archaic period, though later this weapon was probably only in ceremonial use, and was replaced with the bronze battle axe. The spearmen were supported by archers carrying a composite bow and arrows with arrowheads made of flint or copper. No armour was used during the 3rd and early 2nd Millennium BC. As the dynasties expanded and grew upon the last that fell to gain new territory and control new people for the empire of Egypt. One of the ways the dynasties were different were the new technologies used in the later dynasties against the enemy. One example is the armies of Ramesses’ II faced off against the Hittites in the Battle of Qadesh. Both armies have cavalry units supporting their infantry and scouts to get updates on the movements. These advances differ from two groups attacking head on for control of an area and facing losses on both sides

The major advance in weapons technology and warfare began around 1600 BC when the Egyptians fought and defeated the [[Hyksos]] people, who ruled Lower Egypt at the time. It was during this period the horse and chariot were introduced into Egypt. Other new technologies included the [[sickle sword]], body [[armour]] and improved bronze casting. In the [[New Kingdom]], the Egyptian military changed from levy troops into a firm organization of professional soldiers. Conquests of foreign territories, like Nubia, required a permanent force to be garrisoned abroad. The Egyptians were mostly used to slowly defeating a much weaker enemy, town by town, until beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a weaker city or kingdom one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved. The encounter with other powerful Near Eastern kingdoms like [[Mitanni]], the [[Hittites]], and later the [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]], made it necessary for the Egyptians to conduct campaigns far from home. The next leap forwards came in the Late Period (712–332 BC), when mounted troops and weapons made of iron came into use. After the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], Egypt was heavily Hellenized and the main military force became the infantry [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]]. The ancient Egyptians were not great innovators in weapons technology, and most weapons technology innovation came from Western Asia and the Greek world.

These soldiers were paid with a plot of land for the provision of their families. After fulfilment of their service, the veterans were allowed retirement to these estates. Generals could become quite influential at the court, but unlike other feudal states, the Egyptian military was completely controlled by the king. Foreign mercenaries were also recruited; first Nubians ([[Medjay]]), and later also Libyans and Sherdens in the New Kingdom. By the Persian period Greek mercenaries entered service into the armies of the rebellious pharaohs. The Jewish mercenaries at [[Elephantine]] served the Persian overlords of Egypt in the 5th century BC. Although,  they might also have served the Egyptian Pharaohs of the 6th century BC.

As far as had been seen from the royal propaganda of the time, the king or the crown prince personally headed the Egyptian troops into battle. The army could number tens of thousands of soldiers, so the smaller battalions consisting of 250 men, led by an officer, may have been the key of command. The tactics involved a massive strike by archery followed by an infantry and/or chariotry attacking the broken enemy lines. The enemies could,  however, try to surprise the large Egyptian force with ambushes and by blocking the road as the Egyptian campaign records informs us.

Within the [[Nile]] valley itself, ships and barges were important military elements. Ships were vital for providing supplies for the troops. The Nile river had no fords so barges had to be used for river crossings. Dominating the river often proved necessary for prosecuting sieges, like the Egyptian conquest of the [[Hyksos]] capital [[Avaris]]. Egypt had no navy to fight naval battles at sea before the Late Period. However, a battle involving ships took place at the Egyptian coast in the 12th century BC between [[Ramesses III]] and seafaring raiders.

==== Persia ====
{{main article|Military history of Iran}}
Ancient Persia first emerged as a major military power under [[Cyrus the Great]]. Its form of warfare was based on massed infantry in light armor to pin the enemy force whilst cavalry dealt the killing blow. Cavalry was used in huge numbers but it is not known whether they were heavily armored or not. Most Greek sources claim the Persians wore no armor, but we do have an example from Herodotus which claims that an unhorsed cavalry Officer wore a gold cuirass under his red robes. Chariots were used in the early days but during the later days of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] they were surpassed by horsemen. During the Persian Empire's height, they even possessed [[war elephants]] from North Africa and distant India. The elite of the Persian Army were the famous [[Persian Immortals]], a 10,000 strong unit of professional soldiers armed with a spear, a sword and a bow. Archers also formed a major component of the Persian Army.

Persian tactics primarily had four stages involving archers, infantry and cavalry. The archers, which wielded longbows, would fire waves of arrows before the battle, attempting to cut the enemy numbers down prior battle. The cavalry would then attempt to run into the enemy and sever communications between generals and soldiers. Infantry would then proceed to attack the disoriented soldiers, subsequently weakened from the previous attacks.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Military history of India}}
During the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1500–500 BC), the ''[[Vedas]]'' and other associated texts contain references to warfare. The earliest allusions to a specific battle are those to the  [[Battle of the Ten Kings]] in [[Mandala 7]] of the [[Rigveda]].

The two great ancient epics of [[India]], ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (c. 1000–500 BC) are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Valmiki]]'s ''Ramayana'' describes [[Ayodhya]]'s military as defensive rather than aggressive. The city, it says, was strongly fortified and was surrounded by a deep moat. ''Ramayana'' describes Ayodhya in the following words: "The city abounded in warriors undefeated in battle, fearless and chinskilled in the use of arms, resembling lions guarding their mountain caves". ''Mahabharata'' describes various military techniques, including the ''[[Chakravyuha]]''.

The world's first recorded military application of [[war elephant]]s is in the Mahabharatha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management|author=R. Sukumar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; From India, war elephants were brought to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] where they were used in several campaigns. The Persian king [[Darius III]] employed about 50 Indian elephants in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC) fought against Alexander the Great. In the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], the Indian king [[King Porus|Porus]], who ruled in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], with his smaller army of 200 war elephants, 2000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, presented great difficulty for Alexander the Great's larger army of 4000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry, though Porus was eventually defeated. At this time, the [[Nanda Empire]] further east in [[North India|northern]] and [[East India|eastern]] India had an army of 6000 war elephants, 80,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and 8000 armed chariots.

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–275 BC) was a professor of [[political science]] at [[Takshashila University]], and later the [[Prime Minister]] of emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Chanakya wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which covered various topics on ancient Indian warfare in great detail, including various techniques and strategies relating to war. These included the earliest uses of [[espionage]] and [[assassination]]s. These techniques and strategies were employed by Chandragupta Maurya, who was a student of Chanakya, and later by [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BC).

Chandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha Empire and expanded to all of northern India, establishing the Maurya Empire, which extended from the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. In 305 BC, Chandragupta defeated [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who ruled the [[Seleucid Empire]] and controlled most of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great. Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia, including southern [[Afghanistan]], to Chandragupta. Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta. In this matrimonial alliance the enmity turned into friendship, and Seleucus' dispatched an ambassador, [[Megasthenes]], to the Mauryan court at [[Pataliputra]]. As a result of this treaty, the Maurya Empire was recognized as a great power by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic World]], and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] sent their own ambassadors to his court. According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya built an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 war elephants, and 600,000 infantry, which was the largest army known in the ancient world. Ashoka went on to expand the Maurya Empire to almost all of [[South Asia]], along with much of Afghanistan and parts of [[Iran|Persia]]. Ashoka eventually gave up on warfare after converting to [[Buddhism]].

=== China ===
{{main article|Military history of China (pre-1911)}}
Ancient China during the [[Shang Dynasty]] was a Bronze Age society based on [[chariot]] armies. Archaeological study of Shang sites at [[Anyang]] have revealed extensive examples of chariots and bronze weapons. The overthrow of the Shang by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] saw the creation of a feudal social order, resting militarily on a class of aristocratic chariot warriors (士).

In the [[Spring and Autumn period]], warfare increased exponentially. ''Zuo zhuan'' describes the wars and battles among the feudal lords during the period. Warfare continued to be stylised and ceremonial even as it grew more violent and decisive. The concept of military hegemon (霸) and his "way of force" (霸道) came to dominate Chinese society. Sun Tzu created a book that still applies to today's modern armies.

Formations of the army can be clearly seen from the Terracotta Army of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor in the history of China to be successful in unification of different warring states. Light infantry acting as shock troops lead the army, followed by heavy infantry as the main body of the army. Wide usage of cavalry and chariots behind the heavy infantry also gave the Qin army an edge in battles against the other warring states.

Warfare became more intense, ruthless and much more decisive during the [[Warring States period]], in which great social and political change was accompanied by the end of the system of chariot warfare and the adoption of mass infantry armies. Cavalry was also introduced from the northern frontier, despite the cultural challenge it posed for robe-wearing Chinese men. Chinese river valley civilizations would adopt nomadic "[[pants]]" for their cavalry units and soldiers.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{main article|Military history of Greece|Ancient Greek warfare}}

In general, most features of the [[Hoplite#Equipment|hoplite panoply]] of classical Greek antiquity, were already known during the Late Bronze Age by [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] (c. 1600–1100 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Donald|last2=Viggiano|first2=Gregory F.|title=Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece|year=2013|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4630-6|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=xx6orLkVV4YC|ref=harv|page=36|quote=In fact, most of the essential items of the "hoplite panoply" were known to Mycenaean Greece, including the metallic helmet and the single thrusting spear}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean Greek society invested in the development of [[Military of Mycenaean Greece|military infrastructure]], while military production and logistics were supervised directly from the palatial centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palaima |first1=Tom |title=Mycenaean Militarism from a Textual Perspective |journal=Polemos: Warfare in the Aegean Bronze Age (Aegaeum) |date=1999 |volume=19 |pages=367–78 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/oldsite/publications/pdf/militarism.pdf |accessdate=14 October 2015 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infantry did almost all of the fighting in Greek battles. The Greeks did not have any notable cavalry tradition except the Thessalians.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalry Operations in the Ancient Greek World by Robert E. Gaebel,{{ISBN|0-8061-3444-5}}, 2004, p. 59, "... It is perhaps unlikely that by 500 cavalry played an important military role anywhere south of Thessaly, where cavalry traditionally dominated, but there can be little doubt that there were aristocratic cavalrymen on the battlefields in some ..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoplites]], Greek infantry, fought with a long spear and a large shield, the [[hoplon]] also called [[aspis]]. Light infantry (psiloi) [[peltasts]], served as skirmishers.

Despite the fact that most Greek cities were well fortified (with the notable exception of [[Sparta]]) and Greek siege technology was not up to the task of breaching these fortifications by force, most land battles were pitched ones fought on flat-open ground. This was because of the limited period of service Greek soldiers could offer before they needed to return to their farms; hence, a decisive battle was needed to settle matters at hand. To draw out a city's defenders, its fields would be threatened with destruction, threatening the defenders with starvation in the winter if they did not surrender or accept battle.

This pattern of warfare was broken during the [[Peloponnesian War]], when [[Athens]]' command of the sea allowed the city to ignore the destruction of the Athenian crops by [[Sparta]] and her allies by shipping grain into the city from the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. This led to a warfare style in which both sides were forced to engage in repeated raids over several years without reaching a settlement. It also made sea battle a vital part of warfare. Greek naval battles were fought between [[triremes]] – long  and speedy rowing ships which engaged the enemy by ramming and boarding actions.

==== Hellenistic Era ====
{{Main article|Ancient Macedonian army|Hellenistic armies}}
During the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] were regarded as the most complete well co-ordinated [[military]] force in the known world. Although they are best known for the achievements of [[Alexander the Great]], his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] created and designed the fighting force Alexander used in his conquests. Before this time and for centuries their military prowess was nowhere near that the [[sarissa]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] offered.

However prior to the improvements made by [[Philip II of Macedon]] armies fought in the traditional manner of the Greeks; that of the [[hoplite]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]].

Philip provided his [[Macedon]]ian soldiers in the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] with [[sarissa]], a [[spear]] which was 4–6 meters in length. The sarissa, when held upright by the rear [[Rank (formation)|rank]]s of the phalanx (there were usually eight ranks), helped hide maneuvers behind the phalanx from the view of the enemy. When held horizontal by the front ranks of the phalanx, enemies could be run through from far away.The [[hoplite]] type troops were not abandoned,&lt;ref name=":4" &gt;Macedonian Warrior Alexander's elite infantryman, p. 41,{{ISBN|978-1-84176-950-9}},2006&lt;/ref&gt; but were no longer the core of the army.

In 358 BC he met the [[Illyrians]] in battle with his reorganized Macedonian phalanx, and utterly defeated them. The Illyrians fled in panic, leaving the majority of their 9,000-strong army dead. The [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian army]] invaded [[Illyria]] and conquered the southern Illyrian tribes.

After the defeat of the [[Illyrians]], [[Macedon]]'s policy became increasingly aggressive. [[Paionia|Paeonia]] was already forcefully integrated into [[Macedon]] under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]]'s rule. In 357 BC Philip broke the treaty with [[Athens]] and attacked [[Amphipolis]] which promised to surrender to the [[Athenians]] in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], a promise he didn't keep. The city fell back in the hands of [[Macedon]]ia after an intense [[siege]]. Then he secured possession over the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of nearby [[Mount Pangaeus]], which would enable him to finance his future wars.

In 356 the Macedonian army advanced further eastward and captured the town of [[Crenides]] (near modern [[Drama, Greece|Drama]]) which was in the hands of the [[Thracians]], and which Philip renamed after himself to [[Philippi]]. The Macedonian eastern border with [[Thrace]] was now secured at the river [[Nestus]] (Mesta).

[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] next marched against his southern enemies. In [[Thessaly]] he defeated his enemies and by 352, he was firmly in control of this region. The Macedonian [[army]] advanced as far as the pass of [[Thermopylae]] which divides [[Greece]] in two parts, but it did not attempt to take it because it was strongly guarded by a joint force of [[Athenians]], [[Sparta]]ns, and [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]].

Having secured the bordering regions of [[Macedon]], [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] assembled a large Macedonian army and marched deep into Thrace for a long conquering campaign. By 339 after defeating the Thracians in series of battles, most of [[Thrace]] was firmly in Macedonian hands save the most eastern [[Greece|Greek]] coastal cities of [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] who successfully withstood the long and difficult sieges. But both [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] would have surely fallen had it not been for the help they received from the various Greek city-states, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king himself, who now viewed the rise of [[Macedon]]ia and its eastern expansion with concern. Ironically, the Greeks invited and sided with the [[Persian people|Persians]] against the Macedonians, although Persia had been the nation hated the most by [[Greece]] for more than a century. The memory of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Greece]] some 150 years ago was still alive, but the current politics for the Macedonians had put it aside.

Much greater would be the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who would add to the phalanx a powerful [[cavalry]],  led by his elite [[Companion Cavalry|Companions]], and flexible, innovative formations and tactics.  He advanced [[Greece|Greek]] style of combat, and was able to muster large bodies of men for long periods of time for his campaigns against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].

=== Iron Age Europe ===

==== Roman Empire ====
{{main article|Military History of Rome|Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations}}
The [[Roman army]] was the world's first professional army. It had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] around 100 BC turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 20 years before being discharged.

The Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were bribed to serve as mercenaries.

The Roman navy was traditionally considered less important, although it remained vital for the transportation of supplies and troops, also during the great purge of pirates from the Mediterranean sea by Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC. Most of Rome's battles occurred on land, especially when the Empire was at its height and all the land around the [[Mediterranean]] was controlled by Rome.

But there were notable exceptions. The [[First Punic War]], a pivotal war between Rome and Carthage in the 3rd century BC, was largely a naval conflict. And the naval [[Battle of Actium]] established the Roman empire under [[Augustus]].

==== Balkans ====
{{Main article|Illyrian warfare}}

The Illyrian king [[Bardyllis]] turned part of south [[Illyria]] into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. He managed to become king of the [[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanians]]&lt;ref&gt;Borza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon, 1990, p. 180, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}.

 {{Main article|Thracian warfare}}
The [[Thracians]] fought as [[peltast]]s using [[javelins]] and crescent or round wicker shields.Missile weapons were favored but close combat weaponry was carried by the Thracians as well. These close combat weapons varied from the dreaded [[Rhomphaia]] &amp; [[Falx]]
to [[spear]]s and swords. Thracians shunned armor and greaves and fought as light as possible favoring mobility above all other traits and had excellent horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC (Hardcover)

{{Main article|Dacian warfare}}
The [[Dacians|Dacian]] tribes, located on modern-day [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] were part of the greater [[Thracians|Thracian]] family of peoples. They established a highly [[militarized]] society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one [[Monarch|king]] (82–44 BC, 86–106) posed a major threat to the [[Roman province]]s of Lower [[Danube]]. Dacia was conquered and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|war]].

==== Celtic ====
{{main article|Celtic warfare}}
{{further information|Gallic Wars|Gaelic warfare}}

[[Endemic warfare|Tribal warfare]] appears to have been a regular feature of [[Celts|Celtic societies]]. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.

The Celts were described by classical writers such as  [[Strabo]], [[Livy]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and [[Florus]] as fighting like "wild beasts", and as hordes. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] said that their "manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in [[military science]]. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of [[Boar|wild boars]], throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all".&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  ''Roman Antiquities''

{{further information|Germanic Wars|Gothic warfare|Anglo-Saxon warfare|Migration period spear}}
Historical records of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] in [[Germania]] east of the [[Rhine]] and west of the [[Danube]] do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100 BC can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by [[Rome]] and [[Greece]]. Instead the Germanic tribes focused on raids.

The purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by [[irregular military|irregular troops]], often formed along family or village lines. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children.

Though often defeated by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the Germanic tribes were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to unite successfully into one fighting force, under one [[Command (military formation)|command]].&lt;ref name="Tacitus"&gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#45|2.45]]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the three [[Roman legion]]s were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes headed by [[Arminius]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, the Roman Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the Rhine. Prolonged warfare against the Romans accustomed the Germanic tribes to improved tactics such as the use of reserves, military discipline and centralised command.&lt;ref &lt;ref name="Tacitus"/&gt; Germanic tribes would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare.

=== Japanese ===
{{main article|Military history of Japan}}
Horses and bows were very important in Japan, and were used in warfare from very early times, as shown in statues and artifacts found in tombs of early chieftains. Samurai eventually became very skilled in using the horse. Because their main weapon at this time was the bow and arrow, early samurai exploits were spoken of in Japanese war tales as the “Way of the Horse and Bow.” Horse and bow combined was a battlefield advantage to the early samurai. A bunch of arrows made of mainly wood with poison tipped points were worn on a warrior’s right side so he could quickly knock and release an arrow mid-gallop.

Although they weren’t as important as the bow, swords of various sizes and types were also part of an early samurai's armory. They were mostly for close quarters engagements. Many different kinds of spears were also used. One, the [[naginata]], was a curved blade fixed to the end of a pole several feet long. This was known as a 'woman’s spear' because samurai girls were taught to use it from an early age. A device called the kumade, which resembled a long-handled garden rake, was used to catch the clothing or helmet of enemy horsemen and unseat them.

Common samurai archers had armor made of lamellae pieces laced together with colorful cords. The lightweight armor allowed for greater freedom of movement, faster speed, and reduced fatigue for horse and rider.

The early [[Yamato period]] had seen a continual engagement in the Korean Peninsula until Japan finally withdrew, along with the remaining forces of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Several battles occurred in these periods as the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor's]] succession gained importance. By the [[Nara period]], [[Honshū]] was completely under the control of the [[Yamato (people)|Yamato]] clan. Near the end of the [[Heian period]], [[samurai]] became a powerful political force, thus starting the feudal period.

== Notable ancient wars ==
* [[Ionian Revolt]]
:The '''Ionian Revolt''' was a series of conflicts between the [[Ionia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began 499 BC and lasted until 493 BC. The revolt begins because of Athens's offensive attack to the city of Sardis and massacring the Persian citizens by burning down the city. This revolt had a major role in starting the Greco-Persian wars.
* [[Greco-Persian Wars]]
:The '''Greco-Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between the [[Ancient Greece|Greek City-States]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began around 500 BC and lasted until 448 BC.
* [[Peloponnesian War]]
:The '''Peloponnesian War''' was begun in 431 BC between the [[Athenian Empire]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]] which included [[Sparta]] and [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]]. The war was documented by [[Thucydides]], an Athenian general, in his work ''[[The History of The Peloponnesian War]]''. The war lasted 27 years, with a brief truce in the middle.
* [[Wars of Alexander the Great]].
:King Alexander the III of Macedonia throughout his entire reign from 336 to 321 B.C embarked on a '''campaign of conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]'''. Starting from modern day Western Turkey Alexander the Great conquered the entirety of Egypt, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India and Central Asia. Never losing a battle Alexander expanded the boundaries of the known world to the [[Hellenistic period|Greek World]] at the time. With an untimely death his successors fought over the territories they had conquered. However, due to Alexander the Great Greek culture and technology spread into Asia for centuries to come. 
* [[Kalinga War]] (265–264 BC) was a war fought between the [[Mauryan Empire]] under [[Ashoka]] and the state of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], a feudal [[republic]] located on the coast of the present-day [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. According to some of these (Rock Edict XIII and Minor Rock Edict I), the Kalinga War prompted Ashoka, already a non-engaged Buddhist, to devote the rest of his life to [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) and to Dhamma-Vijaya (victory through [[Dhamma]]).
*[[Qin's wars of unification]]
:'''Qin's wars of unification were''' a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] against the other [[Seven Warring States|six major states]] – [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]] – within the territories that formed modern [[China]]. By the end of the wars in 221 BC, Qin had unified most of the states and occupied some lands south of the [[Yangtze River]]. The territories conquered by Qin served as the foundation of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Empire]].
* [[Punic Wars]]
:'''The Punic Wars''' were a series of three wars fought between [[Rome]] and the city of [[Carthage]] (a [[Phoenicia]]n descendant). They are known as the "Punic" Wars because Rome's name for Carthaginians was ''Punici'' (older ''Poeni'', due to their Phoenician ancestry). They determined that the Romans would control the Mediterranean Sea and led to the eventual rise of the greater [[Roman Empire]] across Europe, Asia and Africa.
# The [[First Punic War]] was primarily a naval war fought between 264 BC and 241 BC.
# The [[Second Punic War]] is famous for [[Hannibal]]'s crossing of the [[Alps]] and was fought between 218 BC and 202 BC.
# The [[Third Punic War]] resulted in the destruction of Carthage and was fought between 149 BC and 146 BC.


* [[Roman-Persian Wars]]
:The '''Roman&amp;ndash;Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between states of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and two successive [[Greater Iran|Iranian empires]]: the Parthian and the Sassanid. Battles between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Roman Republic]] began in 92&amp;nbsp;BC;  wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid empire]]s. They were ended by the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Muslim invasions]], which devastated the Sassanid and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine East Roman]] empires shortly after the end of the last war between them.

*[[Han–Xiongnu War]]
:The '''Han–Xiongnu War''',&lt;ref name=wu5-71&gt;{{Harvnb|Wu|2013|loc=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Sino-Xiongnu War''',&lt;ref name="ZaidanSentā2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nara Shiruku Rōdo-haku Kinen Kokusai Kōryū Zaidan|author2=Shiruku Rōdo-gaku Kenkyū Sentā|title=Opening up the Silk Road: the Han and the Eurasian world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfVwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=Nara International Foundation Commemorating the Silk Road Exposition|isbn=978-4-916071-61-3|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a series of military battles fought between the Chinese [[Han Dynasty|Han empire]] and the [[Xiongnu]] confederated state located in modern day Mongolia from 133 BC to 89 AD. The final wars resulted in the final destruction of the [[Xiongnu]] as a political entity in Siberia. China would temporally enjoy peace on its northern frontier before new peoples such as the [[Xianbei]] took the role of the [[Xiongnu]]. 

* [[Germanic Wars|Roman-Germanic Wars]]
:The''' Germanic Wars''' is a name given to a large series of military engagements between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] between 113 BC and AD 596. The nature of these wars varied through time between Roman conquest, Germanic uprisings and later Germanic invasions in the Roman Empire that started in the late 2nd century. The series of conflicts which began in the 5th century, under the Western Roman [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]], led (along with internal strife) to the ultimate downfall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].

'''Archival research''' is a type of research which involves seeking out and extracting [[evidence]] from [[archive|archival]] [[document|records]]. These records may be held either in collecting institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciscra.org/mat/mat/term/64|title=Multilingual Archival Terminology|last=International Council on Archives|first=|date=|website=International Council on Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as libraries and museums, or in the custody of the organization (whether a government body, business, family, or other agency) that originally generated or accumulated them, or in that of a successor body (transferring, or in-house archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/i/institutional-archives|title=A glossary of archival and records terminology|last=Society of American Archivists|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival research can be contrasted with (1) [[secondary research]] (undertaken in a [[library]] or [[Internet research|online]]), which involves identifying and consulting [[secondary source]]s relating to the topic of enquiry; and (2) with other types of primary research and [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]] such as [[Field research|fieldwork]] and [[experiment]].

==History of archives organizations==
The oldest archives have been in existence for hundreds of years. For instance, the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] was started in the 17th century AD and contains state papers, papal account books, and papal correspondence dating back to the 8th century. Most archives that are still in existence do not claim collections that date back quite as far as the Vatican Archive. The [[Archives nationales|Archives Nationales]] in France was founded in 1790 during the French Revolution and has holdings that date back to AD 625, and other European archives have a similar provenance. Archives in the modern world, while of more recent date, may also hold material going back several centuries, for example the United States [[National Archives and Records Administration]] was established originally in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Archive.gov. National Records and Archive Administration, 1 December 2009. Web. 5 December 2009 &lt;https://www.archives.gov/research/start/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The NARA contains records and collections dating back to the founding of the United States in the 18th century. Among the collections of the NARA are the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and an original copy of the Magna Carta. The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|British National Archives (TNA)]] traces its history to the creation of the [[Public Record Office]] in 1838, while other state and national bodies were also formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Universities are another venue for archival holdings and manuscript collections. Most universities have archival holdings that chronicle the business of the university. Some universities also have archives or manuscript collections that focus on one aspect or another of the culture of the state or country in which the university is located. Museums and local history centers may also be good sources for archival materials.

The reason for highlighting the breadth and depth of historical archives is to give some idea of the difficulties facing archival researchers. Some of these archives hold vast quantities of records. For example, the Vatican Secret Archive has upwards of 52 miles of archival shelving. An increasing number of archives are now accepting digital transfers, which can also present challenges for display and access.

== Archival research methodologies ==
Archival research lies at the heart of most academic and other forms of original [[Historical method|historical research]]; but it is frequently also undertaken (in conjunction with parallel research methodologies) in other disciplines within the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s, including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], rhetoric&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L'Eplattenier|first=Barbara E.|date=2009|title=An Argument for Archival Research Methods: Thinking Beyond Methodology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25653008|journal=College English|volume=72|issue=1|pages=67–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[archaeology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[organizational studies]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It may also be important in other non-academic types of enquiry, such as the [[Adoption#Reunion|tracing of birth families by adoptees]], and [[criminal investigation]]s. Data held by archival institutions is also of use in scientific research and in establishing civil rights.

In addition to discipline, the kind of research [[methodology]] used in archival research can vary depending on its organization and its materials. For example, in an archives that has a large number of materials still unprocessed, a researcher may find consulting directly with archive staff who have a clear understanding of collections and their organization to be useful as they can be a source of information regarding unprocessed materials or of related materials in other archives and repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=82-83|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an archive is not entirely oriented towards one or relevant to a single discipline, researchers, for example [[Genealogy|genealogists]], may rely upon formal or informal networks to support research by sharing information about specific archives' organization and collections with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Wendy|last2=Johnson|first2=Catherine|date=2003|title=Where Is the List with All the Names? Information-Seeking Behavior of Genealogists|url=https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=66|issue=1|pages=79–95|doi=10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|issn=0360-9081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elizabeth|first=Yakel,|date=2004|title=Seeking Information, Seeking Connections, Seeking Meaning: Genealogists and Family Historians.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1082067|journal=Information Research: An International Electronic Journal|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|issn=1368-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting research at an archive ==
[[File:Hoover-Archive-Reading-Room.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]] Reading Room. A reading room is a space at an archive where users can consult materials under staff supervision.]]
Archival research is generally more complex and time-consuming than [[secondary research]], presenting challenges in identifying, locating and interpreting relevant documents. Although archives share similar features and characteristics they can also vary in significant ways. While publicly funded archives may have mandates that require them to be as accessible as possible other kinds, such as corporate, religious, or private archives, will have varying degrees of access and discoverability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Catherine|date=2000|title=The archaeology of business networks: the use of archival records in case study research|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0965254X.2000.10815560|journal=Journal of Strategic Marketing|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=197–208|doi=10.1080/0965254x.2000.10815560|issn=0965-254X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials may be restricted in other ways, such as on those containing [[Information sensitivity|sensitive]] or [[Classified information|classified]] information, unpublished works, or imposed by agreements with the donor of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/collections-access-policies#policies|title=Collections Access Policies|last=Anonymous|date=2012-04-26|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/declassification/ndc/restricted-records.html|title=General Information about Restricted Records|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/copyright-and-unpublished-material|title=Copyright and Unpublished Material {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, archival records are often unique, and the researcher must be prepared to travel to reach them. Even when materials are available in digital formats there may be restrictions on them that prohibit them from being accessed off-site.

=== Locating archival collections ===
Prior to online search, [[Union catalog|union catalogs]] were an important tool for finding materials in libraries and archives. In the United States, the [[National Union Catalog]] and the [[NUCMC|National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections]] have been used by researchers to locate archives although much of its information has since been migrated to online systems. 

An increasing number of archival institutions can be found via an online search. In addition, portals such as [[Europeana]], the [[Digital Public Library of America]] and the [[National Library of Australia]]'s [[Trove]] provide links to member institutions. 

In the UK, [[Jisc|JISC]] hosts the [https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/ ArchivesHub], while the [[OCLC]]'s [https://www.oclc.org/research/themes/research-collections/archivegrid.html ArchiveGrid] provides an international portal for mostly library based institutions, which use [[MARC standards|MARC]] as a cataloguing tool for their holdings. The [[Association of Canadian Archivists]] (ACA) has partnered with the software company [https://www.artefactual.com/ Artefactual] to create [http://www.archivescanada.ca/ ArchivesCanada], while the [[Australian Society of Archivists]] have used the same software for their [https://directory.archivists.org.au/ Directory of Archives in Australia]. Many other online search tools have been made available to facilitate search and discovery

If an archives cannot be found through online search or a publicly listed collection a researcher may have to track down its existence through other means, such as following other researcher's citations and references. This is particularly true for materials held by corporations or other organizations that may not employ an archivist and thus be unaware of the extent or contents of their materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

In very restricted archives, access may be restricted only to individuals with certain credentials or affiliations with institutions like universities and then only to those of a certain level. Those lacking the necessary credentials may need to request letters of introduction from an individual or institution to provide to the archive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Locating materials within archives ===
Archives usually contain unique materials and their organization may also be entirely unique or idiosyncratic to the institution or organization that maintains them. This is one important distinction with libraries where material is organized according to [[Library classification|standardized classification systems]]. Traditionally, archives have followed the principle of ''[[respect des fonds]]'' in which the [[provenance]] and [[original order]] is maintained although some rearrangement, physical or intellectual, may be done by the archivist to facilitate its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/principles-of-arrangement.html|title=Archives and Records Management Resources|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scaa.usask.ca/rad/section1.htm|title=1. What are Arrangement and Description?|website=scaa.usask.ca|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Finding aid|Finding aids]] are a common reference tool created by archivists for locating materials. They come in a variety of forms, such as registers, card catalogs, or inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/f/finding-aid|title=finding aid {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many finding aids to archival documents are now hosted online as web pages or uploaded as documents, such as at the [[Library of Congress]]' [https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/findaid/findaid.html Rare Book &amp; Special Collections].  The level of detail in finding aids can vary from granular item-level descriptions to coarse collection-level descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/guides/archivedescriptions/|title=Archive Descriptions - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/level-of-description|title=level of description {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archive has a large backlog of unprocessed materials, there may not be any kind of finding aid at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=81|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 2005, an ideology known as "[[More Product, Less Process]]", or MPLP, has been adopted by many archives seeking to reduce [[Archival processing|processing]] time or alleviate backlogs to provide access to materials sooner, the results of which may be minimally described finding aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=65-66|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most archive repositories welcome researchers, and have [[archivist|professional staff]] tasked with assisting them, the large quantity of records means that finding aids may be of only limited usefulness: the researcher will need to hunt through large quantities of documents in search of material relevant to his or her particular enquiry. Some records may be closed to public access for reasons of [[confidentiality]]; and others may be written in [[Palaeography|archaic handwriting]], in ancient or foreign languages, or in technical terminology. Archival documents were generally created for immediate practical or administrative purposes, not for the benefit of future researchers, and additional contextual research may be necessary to make sense of them. Many of these challenges are exacerbated when the records are still in the custody of the generating body or in private hands, where owners or custodians may be unwilling to provide access to external enquirers, and where finding aids may be even more rudimentary or non-existent.

=== Consulting archival materials  ===
==== On-site ====
[[File:ResearchCenterPhotoByKirstenForWebsite960pxWide.jpg|alt=View of the reading room in the Maritime Research Center showing researchers, NPS uniformed staff as well as visitors, at tables consulting archives, books, and audio materials, Reference Librarian Gina Bardi at the Reference Desk in the background.|left|thumb|Reading Room of the [https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/research-center.htm Maritime Research Center, San Francisco]. In the foreground, a user is seated at a table and is consulting materials stored in [[Hollinger box|archival boxes]] which are brought to them by staff.]]
Archival materials are usually held in closed stacks and non-circulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|year=|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|pages=24|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users request to see specific materials from the archives and may only consult them on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.library.ubc.ca/access-and-use-of-archival-materials/|title=Using the Archives {{!}} University Archives Blog|website=archives.library.ubc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/collections/archive-world-music|title=Archive of World Music|website=Harvard Library|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After locating the relevant record location using a finding aid or other discovery tool a user may then have to submit the request to the archives, such as using a request form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/military_archives/index.html|title=Military Archives - The National Institute for Defense Studies|website=www.nids.mod.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archives has part of its holdings located in a separate building or facility, it make take days or weeks to retrieve materials, requiring a user to submit their requests in advance of an on-site consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/research-visit-faqs.html|title=Research Visit FAQs|date=2016-02-11|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reading hall of the Norwegian National Archive (Gardmanahay).jpg|thumb|Reading room of the [[National Archives of Norway]]. In the foreground are [[Image scanner|flatbed scanners]]. Since archival materials are unique, some archives may have equipment available for users to duplicate materials.]]
A reading room is a space, usually within or near the archive, where users can consult archival materials under staff supervision. The unique, fragile, or sensitive nature of some materials sometimes requires the certain kinds of restrictions on their use, handling, and/or duplication. Many archives restrict what kinds of items can be brought into a reading room from outside, such as pencils, notepads, bags, and even clothing, to guard against theft or risk of damage to materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/visit-us/researching-here/can-take-reading-rooms/|title=What can I take into the reading rooms? - The National Archives|last=Archives|first=The National|work=The National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restrictions may be placed on the number of materials that can be consulted at any given time, such as limiting a user to one box at a time and requiring all materials to be laid flat and visible at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/nara-regulations|title=Regulations for NARA Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some archives provide basic supplies including scrap paper and pencils or foam wedges for supporting unusually large materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication services may be available at the archive although the policies, costs, and time required can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2004/a-survival-guide-to-archival-research|title=A Survival Guide to Archival Research: {{!}} Perspectives on History {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/library-archives/collections/get-help/duplication-orders|title=Reproduction Orders|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, archives also allow users to use their own devices, such as handheld cameras, cell phones, and even scanners, to duplicate materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/dc/researcher-info|title=Information for Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some materials may contain information that concerns the [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]] of living individuals, such as medical and student records, and demand special care. Materials that might contain [[personally identifiable information]], such as social security numbers or names, must be handled appropriately, and an archive might provide redacted copies of materials or deny access to materials entirely due to privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taube|first=Daniel O.|last2=Burkhardt|first2=Susan|date=1997|title=Ethical and Legal Risks Associated With Archival Research|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–67|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|issn=1050-8422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://snaproundtable.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/ask-an-archivist-when-to-restrict-personally-identifiable-information-pii/|title=[Ask an Archivist]: When to Restrict Personally Identifiable Information (PII)|date=2016-02-17|work=SNAP Section|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Off-site and electronic materials ====
More and more archival materials are being digitized or are born-digital enabling them to be accessed off-site through the internet or other networked services. Archives that have digital materials accessible to the public may make their holdings discoverable to internet search engines by sharing or exposing their electronic catalogs and/or metadata, using standards like the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)]]. Some institutions have online portals where users can freely access digital materials that have been made available by the archive such as the [http://archives.nypl.org/ Archives of the New York Public Library] or the [https://siarchives.si.edu/collections Smithsonian Institution Archives]. Governments and their related institutions may use these "electronic", or "virtual", reading rooms to upload documents and materials that have been requested by the public such as through [[FOIA request|FOIA requests]] or in accordance with records disclosure policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room|title=NARA Electronic Reading Room/FOIA Library|date=2016-08-31|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/OGC/Records-Reading-Room|title=Records Request Reading Room|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/management/foia-reading.htm|title=FOIA: Reading Room - Golden Gate National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two fighters managed to escape alive from the farmhouse, but were subsequently killed in battle with the besiegers.

The '''Battle of the Paracel Islands''' was a military engagement between the naval forces of the People's Republic of [[China]] (PRC) and the Republic of Vietnam ([[South Vietnam]]) in the [[Paracel Islands]] on January 19, 1974. The battle was an attempt by the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy|South Vietnamese Navy]] to expel the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]] from the vicinity.

As a result of the battle, the PRC established ''de facto'' control over the Paracels.

== Background ==
The Paracel Islands, called Xisha Islands ({{lang|zh|西沙群岛}}; ''Xīshā Qúndǎo'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and Hoang Sa Islands (''Quần Đảo Hoàng Sa'') in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], lie in the [[South China Sea]] approximately equidistant from the coastlines of the PRC and Vietnam (200 [[Nautical mile|nautical miles]]). With no native population, the archipelago’s ownership has been in dispute since the early 20th century.

China first asserted sovereignty in the modern sense to the South China Sea’s islands when it formally objected to France’s efforts to incorporate them into French Indochina during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884–1885). Initially, France recognized [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]]'s sovereignty over the Paracel and [[Spratly Islands|Spratly archipelagos]], in exchange for Chinese recognition of Vietnam as a French territory. Chinese maps since then have consistently shown China’s claims, first as a solid and then as a dashed line. In 1932, one year after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded northeast China]], France formally claimed both the Paracel and Spratly Islands; China and Japan both protested. In 1933, France bolstered their claim and seized the Paracels and Spratlys, announced their annexation, formally included them in French Indochina. They built several weather stations on them, but they did not disturb the numerous Chinese fishermen found there. In 1938 Japan took the islands from France, garrisoned them, and built a submarine base at [[Taiping Island|Itu Aba]] (now Taiping / 太平) Island. In 1941, the Japanese Empire made the Paracel and Spratly Islands part of Taiwan, then under its rule.

In 1945, in accordance with the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo]] and [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Declarations]] and with American help, the [[National Revolutionary Army|armed forces]] of the [[Nationalist government|Republic of China government at Nanjing]] accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrisons in Taiwan, including the Paracel and Spratly Islands. Nanjing then declared both archipelagoes to be part of Guangdong Province. In 1946 it established garrisons on both Woody (now Yongxing / 永兴) Island in the Paracels and Taiping Island in the Spratlys. France promptly protested. The French tried but failed to dislodge Chinese nationalist troops from Yongxing Island (the only habitable island in the Paracels), but were able to establish a small camp on Pattle (now Shanhu / 珊瑚) Island in the southwestern part of the archipelago.

In 1950, after the Chinese nationalists were driven from Hainan by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), they withdrew their garrisons in both the Paracels and Spratlys to Taiwan. In 1954 France ceased to be a factor when it accepted the independence of both South and North Vietnam and withdrew from Indochina.

In 1956 North Vietnam formally accepted that the Paracel and Spratly islands were historically Chinese. About the same time, the PLA reestablished a Chinese garrison on Yongxing Island in the Paracels, while the Republic of China (Taipei) stationed troops on Taiping Island in the Spratlys. That same year, however, South Vietnam reopened the abandoned French camp on Shanhu Island and announced it had annexed the Paracel archipelago as well as the Spratlys. To focus on its war with the North, South Vietnam by 1966 had reduced its presence on the Paracels to only a single weather observation garrison on Shanhu Island. The PLA made no attempt to remove this force.&lt;ref name="Fravel"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strong Borders, Secure Nation: Cooperation and Conflict in China's Territorial Disputes|first=M. Taylor|last=Frivel|publisher=Princeton University Press|chapter=Offshore Island Disputes|pages=267–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prelude ==
On January 16, 1974, six [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] officers and an American observer on the frigate ''Lý Thường Kiệt'' (HQ-16) were sent to the Paracels on an inspection tour. They discovered two Chinese “armored fishing trawlers” laying off Drummond Island to support a detachment of PLA troops who had occupied the island. Chinese soldiers were also observed around a bunker on nearby Duncan Island, with a landing ship moored on the beach and two additional [[Kronshtadt-class submarine chaser|Kronstadt-class submarine chasers]] in the vicinity. This was promptly reported to [[Saigon]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Cutler, [http://www.pcf45.com/cosgrp16/cosgrp16.html The Battle for the Paracel Islands], Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD. Retrieved on 4-24-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Chemillier-Gendreau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=58q1SMZbVG0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=battle+of+the+paracel+islands&amp;lr=#PPA3,M1 Sovereignty Over the Paracel and Spratly Islands], p.3, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2000. {{ISBN|90-411-1381-9}}. Retrieved on 4-24-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and several naval vessels were sent to confront the Chinese ships in the area. The South Vietnamese Navy frigate signaled the Chinese squadron to withdraw, and in return received the same demand. The rival forces shadowed each other overnight, but did not engage.

On January 17, about 30 South Vietnamese commandos waded ashore unopposed on Robert Island and removed the Chinese flag they found flying. Later, both sides received reinforcements. The frigate ''Trần Khánh Dư'' (HQ-4) joined the ''Lý Thường Kiệt'' (HQ-16), while two PLA Navy minesweepers (#274 and #271) joined the Chinese.

On January 18, the frigate ''Trần Bình Trọng'' (HQ-5) arrived carrying the commander of the South Vietnamese fleet, Colonel Hà Văn Ngạc. The corvette ''Nhật Tảo'' (HQ-10) also reached the islands, moving cautiously because it had only one functioning engine at the time.

== Balance of forces ==
These four warships from the South Vietnam Navy would participate in the battle: the [[frigate]]s, {{ship|RVNS|Trần Bình Trọng|HQ-05|3}},{{ref|HQ5}} {{ship|RVNS|Lý Thường Kiệt|HQ-16|3}},{{ref|HQ16}} and {{ship|RVNS|Trần Khánh Dư|HQ-04|3}},{{ref|HQ4}} and the [[corvette]] {{ship|RVNS|Nhật Tảo|HQ-10|3}}.{{ref|HQ10}} A platoon of South Vietnamese naval commandos, an underwater demolition team, and a regular ARVN platoon were by now stationed on the islands.

China also had four warships present: the PLA Navy [[minesweeper]]s #271, #274, #389 and #396. These were old and small warships with an average length of {{convert|49|m|ft|sp=us}} and width of {{convert|6|m|ft|sp=us}}, and they had not been well-maintained. However, they were reinforced by two [[Type 037 class submarine chaser|Type 037 submarine chasers]] (#281 and #282) by the end of the battle. In addition, two PLA marine battalions and an unknown number of irregular militia had been landed on the islands.

Although four ships were engaged on each side, the total displacements and weapons of the South Vietnamese ships were superior. The supporting and reinforcement forces of the PLA Navy did not take part in the battle.

== Military engagement ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
In the early morning of January 19, 1974, South Vietnamese soldiers from ''Trần Bình Trọng'' landed on Duncan Island and came under fire from Chinese troops. Three South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more were wounded. Finding themselves outnumbered, the South Vietnamese ground forces withdrew by landing craft, but their small fleet drew close to the Chinese warships in a tense standoff.

At 10:24&amp;nbsp;a.m., the South Vietnamese warships ''Lý Thường Kiệt'' and ''Nhật Tảo'' opened fire on the Chinese warships. ''Trần Bình Trọng'' and ''Trần Khánh Dư'' then joined in. The sea battle lasted about 40 minutes, with vessels on both sides taking damage. The smaller Chinese warships managed to maneuver into the blind spots of the main cannons on the South Vietnamese warships and damaged all four South Vietnamese ships, especially ''Nhật Tảo'', which could not retreat because her last working engine was disabled. The crew was ordered to abandon ship, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander Ngụy Văn Thà, remained on board and went down with his ship. ''Lý Thường Kiệt'', severely damaged by friendly fire from ''Trần Bình Trọng'', was forced to retreat westwards. ''Trần Khánh Dư'' and ''Trần Bình Trọng'' soon joined in the retreat.

The next day, Chinese aircraft from [[Hainan]] bombed the three islands, and an [[amphibious landing]] was made. The outnumbered South Vietnamese marine garrison on the islands was forced to surrender, and the damaged navy ships retreated to [[Đà Nẵng]].

During the battle, the South Vietnamese fleet detected two more Chinese warships rushing to the area. China later acknowledged these were the [[Type 037 class submarine chaser|Hainan-class submarine chaser]]s #281 and #282. Despite South Vietnamese reports that at least one of their ships had been struck by a missile, the Chinese insisted what the South Vietnamese saw were [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s fired by the crew of #389 and that no missile-capable ships were present, and the Chinese ships closed in because they had no missiles. The South Vietnamese fleet also received warnings that [[U.S. Navy]] [[radar]] had detected additional Chinese [[guided missile frigate]]s and aircraft on their way from Hainan.

South Vietnam requested assistance from the U.S. [[Seventh Fleet]], but the request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=22 January 1974 |title=U.S. Cautioned 7th Fleet to Shun Paracels Clash |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/01/22/97464621.html?pageNumber=3 |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |publisher= |agency=Reuters |accessdate=22 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=21 January 1974 |title=Chinese, Viet Rift Shunned by U.S. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5952220// |newspaper=Albuquerque Journal |location=Albuquerque, NM |publisher= |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=22 December 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Vietnamese casualties ===
The South Vietnamese reported that the warship ''Nhật Tảo'' was sunk and ''Lý Thường Kiệt'' heavily damaged, while ''Trần Khánh Dư'' and ''Trần Bình Trọng'' were both slightly damaged. 53 South Vietnamese soldiers, including Captain Ngụy Văn Thà of ''Nhật Tảo'', were killed, and 16 were wounded. On January 20, 1974, the Dutch tanker, ''Kopionella'', found and rescued 23 survivors of the sunken ''Nhật Tảo''. On January 29, 1974, South Vietnamese fishermen found 15 South Vietnamese soldiers near Mũi Yến ([[Qui Nhơn]]) who had fought on Quang Hòa island and escaped in lifeboats.

After their successful amphibious assault on January 20, the Chinese held 48 prisoners, including an American advisor.{{ref|tu-binh}} They were later released in [[Hong Kong]] through the [[Red Cross]].

=== Chinese casualties ===
The Chinese claimed that even though its ships had all been hit numerous times, none of them had been sunk. Warships #271 and #396 suffered speed-reducing damage to their engines, but both returned to port safely and were repaired. Warship #274 was damaged more extensively and had to stop at [[Woody Island, South China Sea|Yongxing Island]] for emergency repairs. It returned to [[Hainan]] under its own power the next day. Warship #389 was damaged the most by an engine room explosion. Its captain managed to run his ship aground and put out the fire with the help of the minesweepers. It was then towed back to base. Eighteen Chinese sailors were killed and 67 were wounded in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Carl O. Schustser.  [http://www.historynet.com/battle-paracel-islands.htm "Battle for Paracel Islands".]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
A potential diplomatic crisis was averted when China released the American prisoner taken during the battle. Gerald Emil Kosh, 27, a former U.S. Army captain, was captured with the South Vietnamese on Pattle Island. He was described as a “regional [[liaison officer]]” for the [[US Embassy, Saigon|American embassy in Saigon]] on assignment with the South Vietnamese Navy.&lt;ref name="Gwertzman"/&gt; China released him from custody on January 31 without comment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908427,00.html The World: Storm in the China Sea - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT31Jan74"&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=31 January 1974 |title=American Captured on Disputed Island is Freed by China |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/01/31/79639226.html?pageNumber=4 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY |publisher= |agency=Reuters |accessdate=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of [[North Vietnam]] gave a glimpse of their worsening relationship with China by conspicuously not congratulating their ally. An official communique issued by the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] mentioned only its desire for a peaceful and negotiated resolution for any local territorial dispute. In the wake of the battle, North Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister [[Nguyễn Cơ Thạch]] told the Hungarian ambassador to Hanoi that "there are many documents and data about that the islands in question are Vietnamese." Other North Vietnamese cadres told the Hungarian diplomats that in their view, the conflict between China and the Saigon regime was but a temporary one. However, they later said the issue would be a problem of the entire Vietnamese nation.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Szalontai, Im lặng nhưng không đồng tình. BBC Vietnam, March 24, 2009: http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2009/03/090324_paracels_hanoi_reassessment.shtml .&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reunification of Vietnam in April 1975, the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] publicly renewed its claim to the Paracels, and the dispute continues to this day. Hanoi has praised the South Vietnamese forces that took part in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of Hanoi's reactions to the Chinese occupation of the Paracels in 1974–1975, see also Chi-kin Lo, ''China's Policy toward Territorial Disputes. The Case of the South China Sea Islands'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1989), pp. 86–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

Evolution is not explicitly mentioned in the Tipitaka. As no major principles of [[Buddhism]] contradict it, many Buddhists tacitly accept the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]]. Questions about the eternity or infinity of the universe at large are counted among the [[14 unanswerable questions]] which the Buddha maintained were counterproductive areas of speculation. As such, many Buddhists do not think about these kinds of questions as meaningful for the Buddhist goal of relieving oneself and others from suffering.

In his book titled, "''The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science And Spirituality"'' the Dalai Lama dismisses the element of randomness in the theory of evolution based on natural selection:{{quote| From the Buddhist's perspective, the idea of these mutations being random events is deeply unsatisfying for a theory that purports to explain the origin of life. }}
Donald S. Lopez, a renowned Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan studies explains in his book "''Buddhism and Science: a Guide for the Perplexed"'' that in Buddhism, the process of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]] (into any of a large number of states of being including a human, any kind of animal and several types of supernatural being) is conditioned by karma (action of consciousness), which explains Dalai Lama's view.

Buddhists believe the beginning of this world and of life is inconceivable since they have neither beginning nor end, that the world was not created once upon a time, but that the world is constantly being created millions of times every second and that it will always continue to do so.

==Buddhist views==
[[Albert Low]], a [[Zen master]] and author of ''The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution'', (2008) opposes [[neo-Darwinism]] and the [[selfish gene theory]] as he claims they are [[materialistic]]. He also opposes [[creationism]] for being dogmatic and instead advocates [[spiritual evolution]]. The Buddhist writer [[Anagarika Dharmapala]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;even once stated that "the theory of evolution was one of the ancient teachings of the Buddha." However, it has long been taught that indifference to certain matters regarding life and its origins should be practiced. 

This [[Parable of the arrow]] has often been used to illustrate the Buddha's teachings that "practitioners who concern themselves with the origins of the universe and other topics are missing the point of their religious practice."

{{quote|"Suppose someone was hit by a [[poisoned arrow]] and his friends and relatives found a doctor able to remove the arrow. If this man were to say, 'I will not have this arrow taken out until I know whether the person who had shot it was a priest, a prince or a merchant, his name and his family. I will not have it taken out until I know what kind of bow was used and whether the arrowhead was an ordinary one or an iron one.' That person would die before all these things are ever known to him."&lt;ref name="buddhanet"/&gt;}}

[[Stephen T. Asma]] has noted that the Buddha himself largely avoided answering questions about the origins of the universe.

{{quote|But the historical Buddha shunned metaphysical speculations. He refrained from spooky conjectures generally, and thought that origin-stories about how the universe started were avyakata (unanswerable), given our empirical constraints. Most Buddhists take all this as an invitation to embrace the sciences.&lt;ref name="asma"&gt;{{cite web |last=Asma |first=Stephen |authorlink= Stephen T. Asma |url= http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/religion_theseeker/2011/03/evolution-doesnt-bother-buddhists-.html |title= Evolution doesn't bother Buddhists |publisher= [[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buddha argued that there is no apparent rational necessity for the existence of a creator god because everything ultimately is created by mind.&lt;ref name="buddhanet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s16.htm|title=Buddhist Studies (Secondary) The  Buddha's Wisdom and Compassion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a creator is not necessarily addressed by a religion based on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and Buddhism is generally accepting of modern scientific theories about [[Big bang|the formation of the universe]]. This can be argued either from the standpoint that it simply does not matter, or from an interpretation of the Agañña Sutta favoring the notion that it describes the basic concept of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Williams| first =Paul| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Buddhism| publisher =Routledge| year =2004| location =| pages =102| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zuoMLtQoMJcC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=Agga%C3%B1%C3%B1a+Sutta+evolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6YSLIARjjm&amp;sig=HCXmly_Bw5xuaAeN1xE4Zj44OOU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3THPTOmzL5venQfykp3aDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-415-33228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggañña Sutta===

In the [[Aggañña Sutta]], the 27th Sutta of the Digha Nikaya collection that can be found in the [[Pali Canon]], the Buddha gives a highly detailed answer to this question of evolution. The Buddha, speaking to the monk Vasettha, a former [[Brahmin]], states the following:

{{quote|‘There comes a time, Vasetha, when, sooner or later after a long period this world contracts. At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the [[Buddhist cosmology#Ābhāsvara worlds|Abhasara Brahma world]]. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self luminous, moving through the space, glorious—and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhasara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious— and they stay like that for a very long time.

At that period, Vasetha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not yet distinguished, nor months and fortnights, nor years and seasons; there was no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings. And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savory earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with color, smell, and taste. It was the color of fine ghee or butter and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/pdf/AggannaSutta.pdf Aggañña Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because the Buddha seems to present a model of cosmology wherein the universe expands and contracts over extremely long periods of time, this description has been found by some to be consistent with the [[expanding universe]] model and the idea of Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changesurfer.com/Bud/Begin.html Beginnings and Endings: The Buddhist Mythos of the Arising and Passing Away of the World] by James J. Hughes Ph.D. ''Buddhist Perceptions of Desirable Societies in the Future: Papers prepared for the United Nations University'', eds. Sulak Sivaraksa et al. IRCD: Bangkok, Thailand. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|This story is sometimes called a Buddhist creation myth. But read as a fable, it is less about creation and more about the refutation of castes. It seems intended to counter stories in the Rig Veda that justify castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://buddhism.about.com/od/thetripitaka/a/The-Agganna-Sutta.htm |title=The Agganna Sutta |publisher=[[About.com]] |date= December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the Aggañña Sutta, it is clear that animals must have been present before humans could complete their completed their "devolution".

==Spiritual evolution==

{{Main|Spiritual evolution}}

The concept of [[spiritual evolution]] has been taught in [[Buddhism]]. [[William Sturgis Bigelow]], a [[physician]] and Buddhist, attempted to merge [[biology]] with [[spirituality]]; he accepted the existence of both material and spiritual realms. Many of his ideas were discussed in his book ''Buddhism and Immortality'' (1908). Bigelow used the concept of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]]. According to Bigelow spiritual evolution is when an individual emerges from "unconditioned consciousness" and "moves up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection". Next the individual moves to a level of celestial experience, and finally is able to "return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge." Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution; he believed Buddhism and [[science]] were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tweed|first=Thomas A.|title=American encounter with Buddhism, 1844-1912: Victorian culture &amp; the limits of dissent|publisher=UNC Press Books|year=2000|pages=107–108|ISBN=978-0807849064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2010}}

In a forty-year span as a writer Rees has worked largely in four areas:

===Peace and pacifism===

The biography ''Mahatma [[Gandhi]]: Pensaer yr India'' (''Mahatma Gandhi: The Architect of India'') was published in 1970. In a review in the monthly magazine ''Barn'' the Reverend Alwyn Roberts praised the title for bringing the contribution of Gandhi to a new generation of readers. This volume was the inspiration for a series of three books on Welsh [[pacifism|pacifists]]. Each volume included a portrayal of the peace initiatives of well-known peace workers by academics and authors under the titles ''Herio'r Byd'' (1980), ''Dal i Herio'r Byd'' (1983) and ''Dal Ati i Herio'r Byd'' (1988), all edited by D. Ben Rees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5826&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welsh culture===

The author has written a number of books in English and Welsh on writers.

1)  ''Wales: Culture Heritage'' (1982) is a popular introduction to the Welsh press and the eisteddfodic tradition, and seeks to define the contents of Welsh culture.

2)  ''Samuel Roberts'' (1987), a biography of the prolific Victorian author Samuel Roberts of Llanbrynmair. The book was published in English by the University of Wales Press as part of the Writers of Wales series, under the editorship of Dr Meic Stephens and Dr R. Brinley Jones.

3) 12 further volumes between 1975 and 2006, addressing Welsh [[nonconformism|Nonconformity]], Victorian Studies and the history of the Liverpool Welsh community.
-- History of the Liverpool Welsh Community 
Rees is acknowledged as the leading authority on the Liverpool Welsh History since 1984 when he and Professor R.Merfyn Jones  co-authored The Liverpool Welsh and their Religion.His latest  book was based on  Ellesmere Port Welsh community ( 2012).

== Theology ==

Rees  has become an acknowledged  scholar on John Calvin (1509-1564) and of Calvinism since the publication of four books,
three in the Welsh Language,on John Calvin  and his Welsh Disciples in the period  2008 and 2012. He delivered the prestigious
Davies Lecture on John Calvin and the Connexion at the General Assembly of his denomination in Lampeter in 2008. This has been subsequently published as Y Gwron o Genefa: John Calfin a'i ddylanwad (Caernarfon,2012).

[[File:KareldeGoede.jpg|thumb|Relief of the murder of Count [[Charles the Good]], in 1127.]]

'''Galbert of Bruges''' ('''Galbertus''' notarius Brugensis in Latin) was a Flemish cleric and [[chronicler]]. A resident of [[Bruges]] and a functionary in the administration  of the [[count of Flanders]], he is known for his day-by-day [[Latin (language)|Latin]] account ''De multro, traditione et occisione gloriosi Karoli comitis Flandriarum'' of the events surrounding the murder of Count [[Charles the Good]], in 1127 and its aftermath up through the accession of Thierry of Alsace in summer 1128.

'''Gideon Lincecum''' (22 April 1793 – 28 November 1874) was an [[American pioneer]], [[historian]], [[physician]], [[philosopher]], and [[naturalist]].  Lincecum is known for his exploration and settlement of what are now the U.S. states of [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Texas]], which was then beyond the western borders of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Lincecum had good relations with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as he explored the wilderness in the American [[Deep South]]. He was son of Hezekiah and Sally (Hickman) Lincecum, and was born in [[Warren County, Georgia]], on April 22, 1793.&lt;ref name=Texas_history&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Lincecum was self-educated.  He spent his boyhood principally in the company of [[Creek (people)|Muskogees]]. After successive moves, he and his wife, the former Sarah Bryan, moved in 1818 with his parents and siblings to the [[Tombigbee River]], above the site of present [[Columbus, Mississippi]].

While living among the [[Choctaw]] in [[Mississippi]], he recorded their legends and traditions in the [[Choctaw language]].  After moving to [[Texas]], he translated it to [[English language|English]] as the ''Chahta Tradition''.

He sought a new frontier in 1868 and, at the age of seventy-six, with a widowed daughter and her seven children, joined a [[Confederate colonies|Confederate colony]] in [[Tuxpan, Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. He died on November 28, 1874 after a long illness at his [[Long Point, Texas]], home.&lt;ref name=Texas_history /&gt;

==Historian==

Lincecum had contact with [[Chickasaw]], [[Creek (people)|Creek]] (Muscogee), and [[Choctaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] before the [[Indian Removal]]s of the 1830s began.  He learned how to speak and write their languages, learned about their medicine, and recorded their history.  Lincecum frequently visited an elderly Choctaw man named ''Chahta Immataha'', who gave him a detailed account of Choctaw oral history.&lt;ref name=Mississippi_history&gt;

{{cquote|''I remember now, though the time has long passed, with feelings of unfeigned gratitude the many kindnesses bestowed on me and my little family in 1818 and 1819 when we were in their neighborhood, before the country began to fill up with other white people ... .

==Naturalist==
Lincecum was a self-taught naturalist.  Lincecum would spend "countless hours observing birds, insects, weather, rocks, and plants. He regularly corresponded with like-minded individuals, including [[Charles Darwin]] on two occasions. He published numerous articles in scholarly scientific journals and came to be recognized as a thorough and respectable researcher, in spite of his lack of formal education."&lt;ref name=naturalist&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGaugh|first1=Anne|title=Gideon Lincecum – the man|url=https://txmn.org/glc/about/gideon-lincecum/|website=Texas Master Naturalists, Gideon Lincecum Chapter|publisher=Texas A&amp;M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canon (priest)|Canon]] '''Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis''' ({{lang-mt|Ġan Piet Franġisk Agius de Soldanis}}, 30 October 1712 – 30 January 1770), often called '''de Soldanis''' ({{lang-mt|Sultana}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Il-Malti/Il-Malti.%20007(1931)2/02.pdf|title=See footnote 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] linguist, historian and cleric from the island of [[Gozo]]. He wrote the first lexicon and systematic grammar of the [[Maltese language]], and he was the first librarian of the ''Bibliotheca Publica'', the precursor of the [[National Library of Malta]].

==Life==
De Soldanis was born on 30 October 1712 in [[Victoria, Gozo|Rabat]], [[Gozo]], to Andrea Hagius and Valenzia Sultana. He was baptised in the [[St. George's Basilica, Malta|Parish Church of St. George]] the following day. He was born ''Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius'', but he later added ''de Soldanis'' to his name, a [[Latin]]ized version of his mother's surname Sultana, and he is now commonly known by that name.&lt;ref name="carabott4–5"&gt;{{harvnb|Carabott|2012|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monument of Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis.jpeg|thumb|left|Monument of de Solidanis at Villa Rundle Gardens in Victoria, Gozo]]
De Soldanis was privately educated by a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar at the convent of Our Lady of Graces. He later studied literature, philosophy, theology and law at the [[Old University Building, Valletta|Jesuit college]] in [[Valletta]]. De Soldanis was appointed canon of the Gozo Matrice by Bishop [[Paul Alphéran de Bussan]] in 1729, and he was ordained priest six years later in 1735.&lt;ref name="schiavone"&gt;{{harvnb|Schiavone|2009|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Soldanis was interested in history, culture, archaeology and the Maltese language. He had an extensive library and a [[Cabinet of curiosities|museum]] in his house, which contained various old coins and medals, inscriptions, pottery and statues. He wrote several manuscripts in a number of languages, including Maltese, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]]. He published some of his works in [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]] and [[Avignon]], but he never published anything in Malta since there was no printing press at the time.&lt;ref name="carabott4–5"/&gt;

In 1753, he was appointed ''quaresimalista'' of Gozo, the official preacher of [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]en sermons at the Matrice, which was considered to be a position of privilege. Due to the influence of the bishop's brother, De Soldanis traveled throughout Italy and France in the 1750s. At this point, he studied at the [[University of Padua]] and graduated as a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref name="carabott6–7"/&gt; He also became a member of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Accademia degli Apatisti|it}}'' in [[Florence]], the ''Accademia Botanica'' of [[Cortona]], and the ''Accademia di Buongusto'' and the ''Accademia degli Erranti'' in [[Palermo]].&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt;

In 1758, de Soldanis returned to Gozo, but he moved to mainland Malta in 1763, when the knight Louis Guérin de Tencin chose him as the first librarian of the ''Bibliotheca Publica'' in Valletta, the precursor of the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denaro |first1=Victor F. |title=Houses in Kingsway and Old Bakery Street, Valletta |journal=Melita Historica |date=1959 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=204–205 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.02(1956-59)/MH.2(1959)4/orig01.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211153154/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.02%281956-59%29/MH.2%281959%294/orig01.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Soldanis' health began to deteriorate in 1768. He died on 30 January 1770, and he was buried at the [[Collegiate Parish Church of St Paul's Shipwreck]] in Valletta.&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt;

==Works==

===Maltese language===
Throughout his life, De Soldanis wrote a number of works about the [[Maltese language]], which was his main area of interest.&lt;ref name="basilica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three hundred years from De Soldanis' birth|url=http://www.stgeorge.org.mt/news_details.asp?NewsID=2182|website=[[St. George's Basilica, Malta|St. George's Basilica]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425224045/http://www.stgeorge.org.mt/news_details.asp?NewsID=2182|archivedate=25 April 2016|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the first grammar of the Maltese language in 1750, after he was informed that the Portuguese knight Almeida wanted such a grammar to be published. The book was entitled ''Della Lingua Punica presentemente usata da Maltesi, ovvero Nuovi Documenti li quali possono servire di lume all'antica Lingua Etrusca, stesi in due dissertazioni'', and it was published in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt; In this work, de Soldanis hypothesizes that Maltese originates from the [[Punic language]] descending from the [[Etruscan language]]. This hypothesis was later disproven, and Maltese is now regarded as a [[Semitic language]] descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agius|first1=Raymond|title=Giovanni Pietro Agius de Soldanis (1712–1770)|url=http://www.agius.com/maltese/agius.htm|website=agius.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043947/http://www.agius.com/maltese/agius.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1750 to 1762, de Soldanis worked on a second grammar entitled ''Nuova Scuola della Lingua Punica'', but it was never published.&lt;ref name="carabott6–7"&gt;{{harvnb|Carabott|2012|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a four-volume Maltese-Latin-Italian dictionary entitled ''Damma tal-Kliem Kartaginis mscerred fel fomm tal Maltin u Ghaucin'' between 1750 and 1767.&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt; Although it also remained unpublished, this is regarded as his work about the Maltese language, since it presents a unique picture of mid-18th century Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carabott|2012|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Apart from studies on the Maltese language, de Soldanis also wrote works relating to history, archaeology and other topics related to Malta and Gozo. His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] is ''Il Gozo Antico-Moderno e Sacro-Profano'', a two-volume manuscript dealing with the history of Gozo completed in 1746. The manuscript served as the basis for further studies on Gozo,&lt;ref name="basilica"/&gt; but it remained unpublished until 1936, when the Government Press published a translation in Maltese by Giuseppe Farrugia Gioioso. A translation in English by Anthony Mercieca was published in 1999.&lt;ref name="schiavone"/&gt;

In 1751, de Soldanis published ''Mustafà Bassà di Rodi schiavo in Malta, o sia la di lui congiura all'occupazione di Malta descritta da Michele Acciard'', dealing with the [[Conspiracy of the Slaves]] which had occurred two years earlier. This book landed him in trouble with Grand Master [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]], since in it he attacked the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] and argued for the rights of the Maltese. De Soldanis had to go to [[Rome]] to defend himself in front of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], but he returned to Malta in 1752 and was forgiven by Pinto.&lt;ref name="carabott4–5"/&gt;

De Soldanis also wrote a series of dialogues, which are now regarded as having linguistic and socio-cultural importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=David R.|title=A Social and Historical Commentary on 'The Dialogues' of De Soldanis|journal=Journal of Maltese Studies|date=1971|volume=6|pages=1–33|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies.%2006(1971)/orig02marshall.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021254/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies/Journal%20of%20Maltese%20Studies.%2006%281971%29/orig02marshall.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global intellectual history''' is the history of thought in the world across the span of human history, from the [[invention of writing]] to the present. For information about the methodology of [[intellectual history]], please see the [[intellectual history|relevant article]].

In recent years, historians such as [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] have been calling for a ''global intellectual history'' to be written. They stress that to understand the history of ideas across time and space, it is necessary to study from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or global point of view the connections and the parallels in intellectual development across the world. Yet these separate histories and their convergence in the modern period have yet to be brought together into a single historical narrative. Nonetheless, some global histories, like Bayly's own ''Birth of the Modern World'' or [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]]'s ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History'' offer contributions to the huge and necessarily collaborative project of writing the history of thought in a comparative and especially connective way. Other examples of transnational intellectual histories include [[Albert Hourani]]'s ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age''.

The origins of human intellectual history arguably began before the [[invention of writing]], but historians are by definition only concerned with the eras in which writing was present. In the spirit of a historiographic project that is relevant to all human beings and that has yet to be completed, the sections that follow briefly review currents of thought in pre-modern and modern history of the world, and are organized by geographic area (and within each section, chronologically).

==Europe and the Americas==
The modern intellectual history of Europe cannot be separated from various bodies of ancient thought, from the works of classical Greek and Latin authors to the writings of the fathers of the Christian Church. Such a broad survey of topics is not attempted here, however. A debatable but defensible starting point for modern European thought might instead be identified with the birth of [[scholasticism]] and [[humanism]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both of these intellectual currents were associated with classical revivals (in the case of scholasticism, the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]; in the case of humanism, of Latin antiquity, especially [[Cicero]]) and with prominent founders, [[Aquinas]] and [[Petrarch]] respectively. But they were both significantly original intellectual experiences, as well as self-consciously modern, so that they make an appropriate starting point for this survey.

What follows below is a selective and far from complete listing of significant trends and individuals in the history of European thought. While movements such as the Enlightenment or Romanticism are relatively imprecise approximations, rarely taken too seriously by scholars, they are good starting points for approaching the enormous complexity of the history of Europe's intellectual heritage. It is hoped that interested readers will pursue the listed topics in greater depth by consulting the respective articles and the suggestions for further reading.

The intellectual history of western [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] includes:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Scholasticism]]: Associated especially with [[Aquinas]] and the [[recovery of Aristotle]], a movement that was popular in universities and provided a new way of reasoning especially in law, philosophy, theology.
*[[Humanism]]: Humanists were associated with the discipline of [[rhetoric]] but they were not just orators, they also learned ancient languages, especially [[classical Greek]] and created new knowledge about the secular past. The revival of ancient literature and philosophy was of immense importance for the further development of European thought. The first humanist is considered to be [[Petrarch]]. Later exponents of note were [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Lorenzo Valla]], and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].
*[[The Renaissance]]: A movement in the arts and letters, it is associated particularly with humanism, but also with new trends in painting and with the efflorescence of a new courtly culture that from [[Italy]] (c.1350) spread across Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries.
*[[Scientific Revolution|The New Philosophy]]: The 20th century dubbed this the [[Scientific Revolution]], but in the 17th century, the new science was more often considered to be a new way of doing philosophy. It is associated mainly with the thought of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Descartes]]. Other important philosophers were: [[Hobbes]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Advances in [[astronomy]] were made by [[Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe|Brahe]], [[Kepler]] and [[Galileo]].
*[[The Royal Society]]: A secular creation of an intellectual world led by figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christopher Wren]], [[Joseph Addison]], and [[Bishop Sprat]].
*[[The Enlightenment]]: Key developments in thought included [[Human rights|The rights of man]], [[representative democracy|political representation]], [[political economy]], [[deism]]. Notable participants counted [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[David|Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the [[Comte de Buffon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Diderot]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].
*[[The Encyclopaedists]]: The creation of central repositories of knowledge available to all outside of academies, including mass-market encyclopaedias and dictionaries: [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Ephraim Chambers]].
*[[Romanticism]] : Individual, subjective, imaginative, personal, visionary (scholarly sources [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Sidney Hook|Hook]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]).
*[[Post-romanticism]]: Reaction to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], opposes external-only observations by adding internal observations (scholarly sources [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Leopold von Ranke|von Ranke]]).
*[[Modernism]] : Rejects Christian academic scholarly tradition (scholarly sources [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]]).
*[[Pragmatism]] : Links the meaning of beliefs to the actions of a believer, and the truth of beliefs to success of those actions in securing a believer's goals. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]], [[Richard Rorty]]. Originated in late nineteenth century America.
*[[Existentialism]]: Pre- and post-WW2 rejection of Western norms and cultural values.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Edmund Husserl]]. Engaged with the intellectual prominence of fascism and socialism in Europe during in the 1930s and 1940s, which they saw needed both repudiation and study, as a way to re-establish the individual against the values of a hostile and destructive series of communities creating alienation, isolation, and individual meaninglessness.
*[[Postmodernism]] : Rejects Modernism, [[meta-narrative]] - multiple perspective, role of individual (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]]).
*[[Structuralism]] : Many phenomena do not occur in isolation but in relation to each other (scholarly sources [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]).
*[[Poststructuralism]] :[[Deconstruction]], destabilizes the relationship between language and objects the language refers to (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]).

==South and East Asia==
''Pre-Modern East Asia''

The intellectual history of China is connected to the birth of scholarship in ancient China, the creation of [[Confucianism]] with its extensive exegesis of the texts of [[Confucius]], and the active part of scholars in governments. In Korea, the [[yangban]] scholar movement drove the development of [[Traditional Korean thought|Korean intellectual history]] from the late [[Goryeo]] to the golden age of intellectual achievement in the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

In [[China]], ''literati'' referred to the government officials who formed the ruling class in China for over two thousand years. These ''[[scholar-bureaucrats]]'' were a [[status group]] of educated [[laymen]], not ordained [[priest]]s. They were not a [[hereditary]] group as their position depended on their knowledge of writing and literature. After 200 B.C. the system of selection of candidates was influenced by [[Confucianism]] and established its ethic among the literati.

Confucianism (儒家, literally "scholarly tradition") is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius is seen as the founder of the teachings of Confucianism, although he claimed to follow the ways of people before him. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious thought which has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some people in Europe have considered it to have been the "state religion" in East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucianist values and needs.

Other ancient intellectual currents in East Asia include [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]].

''Modern East Asia''

The modern intellectual history of [[China]] is considered to begin with the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in the sixteenth century. The Jesuits brought with them new astronomical and cartographic knowledge, and were responsible for new developments in [[Chinese science]]. Science in modern China has been the subject of the work of the historian [[Benjamin Elman]].

''Pre-Modern South Asia''

Indian thought is a broad topic that includes the ancient epics of South Asia, the development of what is now called [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] and the rise of [[Buddhism]], as well as many other topics relating to the political and artistic lives of pre-modern South Asia.

[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s work ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in India'' ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] is the most authoritative account of ancient Indian political ideas and institutions. It deals with the intellectual standards in ancient India in terms of political institutions.

==Africa and the Middle East==
''Pre-Modern History''

The culture of the ancient [[Near East]] and eventually of much of Africa as well was modified significantly by the arrival of [[Islam]] beginning in the seventh century CE. The history of [[Islam]] has been the work of many scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and including such luminaries as [[Ignác Goldziher]], [[Marshall Hodgson]] and in more recent times [[Patricia Crone]]. Islamic culture is not a simple and unified entity. The history of Islam, like that of other religions, is a history of different interpretations and approaches to Islam. There is no a-historical Islam outside the process of historical development.

[[Islamic thought]] includes a variety of different intellectual disciplines, including theology, the study of the [[Qur'an]], the study of [[Hadith]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For more information see the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

Classical Islamic scholars and authors include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Ali al-Masudi]]
*[[Ibn Khaldūn]]
*[[Al-Ma'arri]]
*[[Taftazani]]
*[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]
*[[Ibn Sina]]
*[[Ibn Rushd]]
*[[Ibn Arabi]]
*[[Ibn Hisham]]
*[[al-Tabari]]

[[Persian philosophy]] can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and  thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by  [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol]] invasions of Persia a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

''Modern Near and Middle East''

[[Islam and modernity]] encompass the relation and compatibility between the phenomenon of modernity, its related concepts and ideas, and the religion of Islam. In order to understand the relation between Islam and modernity, one point should be made in the beginning. Similarly, modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent phenomenon. It has historically had different schools of thoughts moving in many directions.

[[Intellectual movements in Iran]] involve the Iranian experience of [[modernism]], through which Iranian modernity and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures have been evolving since the 19th century. [[Religious intellectualism in Iran]] develops gradually and subtly. It reached its apogee during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–11). The process involved numerous philosophers, sociologists, political scientists and cultural theorists. However the associated art, cinema and poetry remained to be developed.

''Modern Africa''

Recent concepts about African culture include the [[African Renaissance]] and [[Afrocentrism]]. The [[African Renaissance]] is a concept popularized by [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] who called upon the African people and nations to solve the many problems troubling the [[Africa]]n continent.  It reached its height in the late 1990s but continues to be a key part of the post-[[apartheid]] intellectual agenda in South Africa. The concept however extends well beyond intellectual life to politics and economic development.

With the rise of [[Afrocentrism]], the push away from [[Eurocentrism]] has led to the focus on the contributions of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their model of world civilization and [[history]]. Afrocentrism aims to shift the focus from a perceived European-centered history to an [[Africa]]n-centered history. More broadly, Afrocentrism is concerned with distinguishing the influence of [[Demography of Europe|European]] and [[Oriental]] peoples from African achievements.

Notable modern African intellectual include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Taban Lo Liyong]]
*[[Wole Soyinka]]
*[[Frantz Fanon]]
*[[Chinua Achebe]]
*[[Yusuf Bala Usman]]
*[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] spent his final years in Ghana

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6804">The '''Golden Age of Fraternalism''' is a term referring to a period when membership in the [[fraternal society|fraternal societies]] in the [[United States]] grew at a very rapid pace in the latter third of the 19th century and continuing into the first part of the 20th. At its peak, it was suggested that as much as 40% of the adult population held membership in at least one [[fraternal order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=William D|title=Secret Societies in America: Foundational Studies in Fraternalism|url=http://www.cornerstonepublishers.com/ssoc.pdf|website=Cornerstone Publishers|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major examples are the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[Freemasons]], the [[Odd Fellows]], and the [[International Organisation of Good Templars|Good Templars]].

==Beginnings==
[[File:Front_View_of_George_Washington_Masonic_National_Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[George Washington Masonic National Memorial]] is an example of one of the monumental buildings sponsored by the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] during the "Golden Age of Fraternalism."]]
The earliest fraternal societies, the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and the [[Odd Fellows]], had their roots in 18th century America. The Freemasons were especially influential and counted such prestigious members as [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and [[George Washington]] during the radical era. They experienced a precipitous decline after the [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|Morgan Affair]] led to a moral panic against secret societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofstadter|first1=Richard|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=November 1964|url=http://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had largely recovered by the 1850s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Harriett W|title=The Golden Age of Fraternalism: 1870-1910|url=http://phoenixmasonry.org/Golden%20Age%20of%20Fraternalism.pdf|website=Phoenix Masonry|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit slowly.

The [[International Organisation of Good Templars|Independent Order of Good Templars]], which is part of the [[temperance movement]], was unique in that from the beginning, it admitted both men and women, as well as both African Americans and European Americans.&lt;ref name="Schwalm2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwalm|first=Leslie A.|title=Emancipation's Diaspora: Race and Reconstruction in the Upper Midwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VMdUMAhfW8C&amp;pg=PT171|accessdate=17 May 2018|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807894125|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and peak membership==

After the [[Civil War (US)|American Civil War]], the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] was formed, taking its membership from Union veterans seeking to continue the camaraderie of military service. Other fraternal organizations arose as well, such as the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]] (1851), [[Knights of Pythias]] (1864), the [[Patrons of Husbandry]] (the Grange, 1867), [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]] (1868), the [[Knights of Columbus]] (1882), the [[Loyal Order of Moose]] (1888), and the [[Woodmen of the World/Omaha Woodmen Life Insurance Society|Woodmen of the World]] (1890).

These organizations served various goals: mutual aid and insurance, political interests, or social functions, but they each offered their members the comfort of stability and belonging in a dynamic and rapidly industrializing society. They also were less exclusive than the older fraternities, the Masons and Odd Fellows, on which they were modeled. In response, these fraternities also enlarged and offered ever more elaborate ritual and costuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Harriett W|title=The Golden Age of Fraternalism: 1870-1910|url=http://phoenixmasonry.org/Golden%20Age%20of%20Fraternalism.pdf|website=Phoenix Masonry|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, the Odd Fellows were the largest fraternity in the US, with almost a million members, followed closely by the Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=Burke|title=Fraternalism in America 1860-1920|url=http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/fraternalism_in_america.htm|website=Phoenix Masonry|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of fraternalism on the development of government and society were profound. Although, with the exception of the Grand Army of the Republic, they were racially segregated, they nonetheless brought together a broad range of classes under each fraternal banner. They provided a very important insurance function for the average workman, and they brought organization to various political ends.

The Freemasons drew many of its members from the professional and merchant classes, and did not have an explicit insurance program, leaving them financially better off than most other orders. Their origin and ritual, as their name suggests, likely derives from medieval builders. As a result, during the Golden Age of Fraternalism they built many impressive buildings and monuments that survive in most US cities.

==Decline==

The last major fraternity to be organized during this era was also its most controversial— the refounding of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1915. Its principles were largely political as it supported an anti-Catholic, antisemitic, [[White nationalism|white nationalist,]] and anti-immigrant platform. Its decline was as spectacular as its rise. The overt venality of its leaders and their scandals caused widespread revulsion. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hurt all the fraternal orders and the Klan went moribund.

Government welfare programs that formed during the [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] and [[New Deal]] eras, as well as the rise of available commercial insurance, lessened the need for the mutual aid fraternities. Some, such as the Modern Woodmen of the World and the [[Independent Order of Foresters]], became insurance companies themselves.

The Freemasons, as the oldest and most storied of the ritualistic fraternities, continued to grow as a result of an influx of members after World War II, reaching their zenith in terms of absolute numbers in 1959. However, as a percentage of the population, it never matched the reach it attained during the golden age of fraternalism and continues to decline. In 2014, the Masonic Service Association of North America reported only 1.2 million members under their associated Grand Lodges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masonic Membership Statistics 2013-2014|url=http://www.msana.com/msastats.asp|website=Masonic Service Association of North America|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Géza Alföldy''' (June 7, 1935 &amp;ndash; November 6, 2011) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Ancient historian.&lt;ref name=Origo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.origo.hu/kultura/20111107-tragikus-hirtelenseggel-elhunyt-alfoldy-geza-okortortenesz.html|title=Ókori romok között hunyt el a magyar ókortörténész|date=2011-11-07|publisher=Origo.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HVG&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hvg.hu/Tudomany/20111108_alfoldy_geza_meghalt|title=Az Akropoliszon halt meg Alföldy Géza ókortörténész|date=2011-11-08|publisher=[[Heti Világgazdaság]]|language=Hungarian|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diari"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diaridetarragona.com/tarragona/061676/muere/historiador/geza/alfldy/gran/experto/legado/tarraco|title=Muere el historiador Géza Alföldy, gran experto en el legado de Tarraco|last=Cosano|first=Raúl|date=2011-11-07|publisher=[[Diari de Tarragona]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Géza Alföldy was born in [[Budapest]].  He studied at the [[University of Budapest]] from 1953 to 1958, where he in 1959 received a [[doctorate]]. Alföldy worked at the [[Budapest city museum]] from 1957 to 1960, and from 1960 to 1965 he was an assistant professor at the Institute for Ancient History at the University of Budapest. In 1965, he [[emigration|emigrated]] to [[West Germany]], where he initially worked at the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn|Bonn Rhenanian State Museum]] from 1965 to 1968. During this time, Alföldy earned a [[habilitation]] at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1966, where he served as a university lecturer and eventually as a full professor. In the same year he became professor of Ancient History at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]]. Alföldy was appointed professor for Ancient History at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1975 and stayed there until his [[Emeritus|retirement]] in 2002. After the renewal of his professorship, Alföldy taught as a substitute professor until 2005.  He died in [[Athens]], Greece.

In 2003, he acted as historical counsel for the two-part historical film "[[Imperium: Augustus]]" starring [[Peter O'Toole]].

==Work==
Alföldys's main fields of research are:
* History and [[epigraphy]] of the [[Roman Empire]]
* Roman social, military and administrative history
* History of the [[Roman province]]s
* Historiography of the Roman imperial era and [[late antiquity]]
* Roman [[prosopography]]

In the 1990s, Alföldy also concerned himself with the modern history of his native Hungary.

Within the scope of his epigraphical studies, Gezá Alföldy visited many countries (Albania, [[Algeria]], Austria, Britain, [[Cyprus]], [[Egypt]], France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, [[Jordan]], [[Libya]], Portugal, Spain, [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Yugoslavia]]) in order to research original ancient inscriptions.

Furthermore, Alföldy was a guest professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1972/73), in Rome from 1986 and 2003, in Paris (1991), and [[Pécs]] (still in 1993)  in [[Poznań]] (1992), in [[Budapest]] (1993), and also in [[Barcelona]] in 1997 and 1998.

In addition, he continued to deliver diverse academic lectures both in and outside Germany, while supervising scores of new academics during their [[Doctorate|promotion]] or [[habilitation]] phases (more than one dozen alone since 1992).

Alföldy was also co-editor of numerous international academic journals and periodicals. His name was especially associated with the ''Heidelberger Althistorische Beiträge und Epigraphische Studien (HABES)'', which he was sole editor from 1986. Alföldy was corresponding member or honorary member of multiple academic societies and academies and a respected member of the [[Heidelberg Academy]] since 1978.

Apart from organizations like the Heidelberg Academy, Alföldy also worked at many other German research institutes: the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] and the [[German Archaeological Institute]], as well as at Italian, French, and Spanish facilities for research of classical antiquity.

The '''historic center of Mexico City''' ({{lang-es|Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México}}), also known as the '''Centro''' or '''Centro Histórico''', is the central neighborhood in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], focused on [[Zócalo]] or main plaza and extending in all directions for a number of blocks, with its farthest extent being west to the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]].&lt;ref name="Lonely"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lonely Planet Mexico City:Your map to the megalopolis |last=Noble |first=John |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=Oakland CA |isbn=1864500875|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zocalo is the largest plaza in Latin America.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/412 |title= UNESCO World Heritage Sites Mexico City Historic Centre and Xochimilco |accessdate=2008-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can hold up to nearly 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= Mexicans protest nationwide against crime wave |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,414064,00.html |work= |publisher=Fox News |date=August 30, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the capital lies in the municipal borough of [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc]], has just over nine square km and occupies 668 blocks. It contains 9,000 buildings, 1,550 of which have been declared of historical importance.  Most of these historic buildings were constructed between the 16th and 20th centuries. It is divided into two zones for preservation purposes. Zone A encompasses the pre-Hispanic city and its expansion from the Viceroy period until Independence. Zone B covers the areas all other constructions to the end of the 19th century that are considered indispensable to the preservation of the area's architectural and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="MexDes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valdez Krieg |first=Adriana |authorlink= |date=September 2004 |title=Al rescate del centro histórico |journal= Mexico Desconocido |volume=331 |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1307-Al-rescate-del-Centro-Hist%C3%B3rico-(Distrito-Federal) |accessdate=2008-09-02 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is where the Spaniards began to build what is now modern [[Mexico City]] in the 16th century on the ruins of the conquered [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the [[Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; As the centre of the ancient Aztec Empire and the seat of power for the Spanish colony of [[New Spain]], the Centro Historico contains most of the city's historic sites from both eras as well as a large number of museums. This has made it a World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:FountainGarciaBravoDF.JPG|thumb|left|Fountain with busts honoring Alonso Garcia Bravo, who laid out post-Conquest Mexico City conserving much of the original Aztec infrastructure. Located off Merced Street between Jesus María and Talavera, east of the Zocalo.]]

What is now the historic downtown of Mexico City roughly correlates with the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, which was founded around 1325. During the prehispanic era, the city developed in a planned fashion, with streets and canals aligned with the cardinal directions, leading to orderly square blocks.&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt; The island that the city was founded on was divided into four calpullis or neighborhoods that were divided by the main north-south roads leading to [[Tepeyac]] and [[Iztapalapa]] respectively and the west-east road that lead to [[Tacuba]] and to a dike into the lake, respectively. The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a "tecpan" or district council each. The intersection of these roads was the center of the city and of the Aztec world. Here were the Templo Mayor, the palaces of the [[tlatoani]] or emperors, palaces of nobles such as the "House of the Demons" and the "House of the Flowers".  Also located here were the two most renowned Aztec schools: the Telpuchcalli for secular studies and the Calmecac for priestly training. When the Spaniards arrived, the city had aqueducts built by [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]] and [[Ahuizotl]] as well as a large dike constructed to the east of the city.&lt;ref name="oficial"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad de Mexico |last=Horz de Via |first= Elena|year= 1991|publisher= INAH - SALVAT |language=Spanish |isbn=968-32-0540-2 |pages= 8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Spanish conquest, this design remained largely intact, mostly due to the efforts of [[Alonso Garcia Bravo]], who supervised much of the rebuilding of the city. This reconstruction conserved many of the main thoroughfares such as Tenayuca, renamed Vallejo; Tlacopan, renamed México Tacuba, and Tepeyac, now called the Calzada de los Misterios. They also kept major divisions of the city adding Christian prefixes to the names such as San Juan Moyotla, Santa María Tlaquechiuacan, San Sebastián Atzacualco and San Pedro Teopan. In fact, most of the centro historicos is built with the rubble of the destroyed Aztec city.&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

A number of people during this time, all Spaniards, accumulated vast wealth mostly through mining and commerce in the 17th and 18th centuries. This wealth is reflected in the various mansions scattered in the centro such as the [[Palace of Iturbide]] and [[Casa de los Azulejos, Mexico City|Casa de Azulejos]] (House of Tiles). This house was built in the 16th century in Arab style but its namesake tiles were added in 1747 when the Count of the Valley of Orizaba ordered the [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]] tiles from [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="mundo"&gt;{{cite book |title= Patrimonio del Mundo America del Norte |last=Lutz |first= Jurgen |author2=Jochen Schurmann |year= 2002 |language=Spanish |isbn=84-01-61896-7 |volume=1 |pages= 246–257 |publisher= Plaza de Janes |location= Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 20th century, as a result of the Latin American posture of then-Minister of Public Education [[José Vasconcelos]], many of the streets to the north and west of the Zocalo were renamed after Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="historic99"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdalena Galindo  |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |url= |page=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Zócalo and surrounding sites==

Historically, the Zócalo, or main plaza, has been a venue for fine and popular cultural events.  Some example of events held here recently are [[Spencer Tunick]]'s photo shoot,&lt;ref name="UNAM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spencertunickmexico.unam.mx/ |title= Spencer Tunick en Mexico |accessdate=2008-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ashes and Snow]] Nomadic museum&lt;ref name="Ashes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ashesandsnow.org/es/info/?module=page&amp;idsection=1 |title=Exposicion Ciudad de Mexico |accessdate= 2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a skateboarding/BMX event that drew 50,000 young people on 24 August 2008.&lt;ref name="Televisa"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jesus |last=Barba |authorlink= |title= Concierto del Zocalo dejó 70 jovenes lesionados |url=http://www2.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/008550/concierto-del-zocalo-deja-70-jovenes-lesionados |work= |publisher=Noticias Televisa |date=24 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Festival de México'' is an annual event with programs dedicated to art (popular and high) and academia. In 2008, was the 24th Festival with 254 performances and shows from over 20 countries.in 65 plazas and other locations in this section of the city.&lt;ref name="MexDes2"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Hinojosa | first =Beatriz | authorlink = |date=April 2008 | title =Festival de Centro Historico | journal = Mexico Desconocida| volume =374 | issue = | pages =8 | id = | url =http://www.mexicodesconocido | accessdate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is central to national level protests such as those staged by Lopez Obrador after the 2006 Presidential Elections&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= Leftist's supporters paralyze Mexico City Center |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14119697/  |work= |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 1, 2006 |accessdate=2008-08-31  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nationwide protest against crime held on August 30, 2008.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

[[File:MexCity-palacio.jpg|thumb|200px|The National Palace in Mexico City]]
Just off the Zócalo are the Palacio Nacional, the Cathedral Metropolitana, the Templo Mayor with its adjoining museum, and [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] building. The Palacio Nacional borders the entire east side of the Zocalo and contains the offices of the [[President of Mexico]], the Federal Treasury, the National Archives as well as murals depicting pre-Hispanic life and a large mural filling the central stairway depicting the entire history of the Mexican nation from the Conquest on.  This palace was built on the ruins of Moctezuma II's palace beginning in 1521, using the same [[tezontle]] stone used to build the Aztec palace. It was originally in the [[Hernán Cortés]] family until the king of Spain bought it to house the [[viceroys]] of New Spain and remained so (despite being destroyed and rebuilt again in 1692) until Mexican independence. Facing the Zócalo above a central balcony is the Campana (Bell) of Dolores, which is rung by the president each 15th of Sept to celebrate Independence.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;
[[File:Zocalo cathedral.jpg|Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City|thumb|250px|left|Mexico City Cathedral]]

[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|The Metropolitan Cathedral]], dedicated to the Assumption of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, occupies the north end of the Zócalo. The site originally was part of the Aztec Sacred Precinct (called the Teocalli) and contained the main tzompantli, or rack for the skulls of sacrifice victims.  The first church was erected between 1524 or 1526 and 1532 and was elevated to the rank of cathedral on 2 September 1530 by [[Pope Clement VII]].  The foundations for a new cathedral were begun in 1562 and the foundation stone was laid in 1573 in the time of Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras and of the 4th Viceroy.&lt;ref&gt;Castellanos, Montiel Martín, ''Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City'', Editorial Octavio Antonio Colmenares y Vargas, Mexico City (2012), pp.15-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the works had not been concluded, the cathedral received its first dedication on 2 February 1656.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Manuel, ''La Catedral de México'', Porrúa, México (1973), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;  The completion in 1813 of the neo-classical additions designed by [[Manuel Tolsa]] was celebrated on 15 August 2013 by [[Norberto Rivera Carrera|Cardinal Carrera]] who opened and entered through the [[Holy Door]] in the center of the façade prior to celebrating [[Pontifical High Mass]] in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;See the program of events on the cathedral's [http://www.catedralmetropolitanademexico.mx/eventos-del-bicentenario.html official website] accessed 28 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989 and 2000 extensive engineering works were conducted to arrest and rectify damage and distortions caused to the structure by the uneven rate and extent of the sinking of the building provoked by the continuous settlement of the ground on which it stands.  This began with the drainage of the lake of the Valley of Mexico initiated in 1607 and has continued with the reduction of the water-table caused by the pumping of water for use by Mexico City's rapidly expanding population.  The last of the temporary props which had disfigured the interior of the building during the engineering works were removed on 28 November 2000.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the works see Castellanos, Montiel Martín, ''Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City'', Editorial Octavio Antonio Colmenares y Vargas, Mexico City (2012), pp.141-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Templo Mayor 2007.JPG|thumb|150px|A view of the ruins of the Templo Mayor with museum in background]]
The [[Templo Mayor]] archeological site and museum, is the center of the ancient teocalli, located now just northeast of the Zócalo. It was demolished by Hernán Cortés in the 1520s and its location forgotten.  The exact site was determined in the beginning of the 20th century, but the decision to excavate was not made until 1978, when electrical workers chanced upon an eight-ton stone disk depicting the Aztec goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]].  Excavation unearthed a pyramid built in multiple layers.  This is the spot where, according to legend, the Aztecs saw their sign to settle from their wanderings, an eagle perched on a [[nopal]] cactus with a snake in its beak, which is still the symbol of Mexico today.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;
[[File:NatMontePiedadZocaloDF.JPG|thumb|150px|left|National Monte de Piedad]]
The [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] building is the national pawn shop, founded in 1775 and one of the largest second-hand shops in the world.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; On this site were houses that belonged to the last Aztec ruler, Moctezuma II, which Hernán Cortés took for his own after the Conquest. These houses originally stretched from modern-day Isabel la Catolica, Madero, Tacuba and Monte de Piedad streets, prompting one chronicler, Cervantes de Salazar to comment that the residence was not a palace but rather another city.&lt;ref name="historic51"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdalena Galindo  |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |url= |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable sites north of the Zócalo==
[[File:ChurchSantoDomingoDF.JPG|Church of Santo Domingo|250px |thumb|left|Facade of the Church of Santo Domingo.]]
''[[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Santo Domingo]]'' refers to the Church of Santo Domingo and the adjoining plaza.

It is recognizable by [[Manuel Tolsá]]'s large equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain who was the monarch just before Mexico gained its Independence. It was originally in the [[Zocalo]] but it was moved to several locations, not out of deference to the king but rather to conserve a piece of art, according to the plaque at the base.&lt;ref name="Lonely" /&gt; It arrived to its final location in 1979.

[[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]] is a public park in downtown [[Mexico City]], adjacent to the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], between Juarez Avenue and Hidalgo Avenue. It is a green garden with paved paths and decorative fountains and statues, and is frequently the center of civic events. The area used to be an Aztec marketplace and after the Conquest, the Catholic Church used the area for the burning of heretics and witches. The park was created in 1592, when Viceroy [[Luis de Velasco]] decided to create green space here as a public park.  The name comes from the Spanish word ''álamo'', which means [[Populus|poplar]] tree, which were planted here. By the late 19th century, the park included a bandstand and gas (now electric) lamps. On the south side of the park, facing toward the street is the '''Hemiciclo a Juárez''', which is a large white semi-circular monument to [[Benito Juárez]], who is one of Mexico's most beloved presidents.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;

==20th and 21st centuries==

===Deterioration of the area===
From Aztec times, the Centro Historico used to be where the wealthy and elite lived.  However, in the early 20th century, these classes began to move to areas west and southwest of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as [[Colonia Juárez (Mexico City)|Colonia Juárez]], [[Colonia Cuauhtémoc]], [[Colonia Roma]] and [[Condesa|Colonia Condesa]]. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20th century although it was around this time that [[UNAM]] moved most of its facilities to the new [[Ciudad Universitaria]].&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;   The reason for the decline of the city center was partly man-made and partly natural.  In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998 when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying 1950's-level rents. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985 earthquake]] took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000 residents of the "Colonia Centro", leaving the area almost deserted at night.&lt;ref name="belated"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Ron |authorlink= |date=September 2002 |title=Center of Belated Attention |journal=Economist |volume=364 |issue=8290 |pages=37 |id= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, so many had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor,&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facelift"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Geri |authorlink= |date=May 2004 |title=Mexico City gets a face-lift |journal=Business Week |volume= |issue=3884 |pages= |id=00077135 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and its sidewalks and streets taken over by [[pickpocket]]s and milling vendors.&lt;ref name="belated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facelift"/&gt;   For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace to "get into and out of as fast as you can", seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to resort areas like [[Cozumel]].&lt;ref name="belated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facelift"/&gt;  Until recently, many of the restaurants in the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.&lt;ref name="newface"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Ron |authorlink= |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |title=A New Face for the Zocalo |journal=Americas |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=4–6 |id=03790940 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterioration of religious buildings===
[[File:ChapelSanDomingoDF.JPG|thumb|left|Church of San Lorenzo]]
Many of historic churches in the oldest parts of the city are in serious disrepair and are in danger of being lost. Efforts to save these churches are hampered by disagreements between the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and the [[Politics of Mexico|federal government]]. Because these churches are both active religious institutions and historical landmarks, their legal situation is complicated. By law, religious institutions cannot appeal to the government for financial help, but agencies like the [[National Council for Culture and Arts]] (CONACULTA) do have say in how these places are maintained because of their historic value.&lt;ref name="torreon"&gt;{{cite news |title=En riesgo templos del Centro Histórico del DF |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/367782.en-riesgo-templos-del-centro-historico-del-df.html# |work=El Siglo de Torreón |agency=Notimex |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the disagreement is over the extent of the deterioration. Conaculta does not believe that any of the 68 religious buildings in the oldest part of city are in imminent danger of collapse. However the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]] believes that the structural problems noted constitute a grave danger to both people and to the "incalculable artistic and historic value of the buildings."&lt;ref name="torreon"/&gt; One of the churches in imminent danger is called [[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|San Lorenzo Diácono y Mártir]], with [[Nuestra Señora de Loreto Church|Our Lady of Loreto]], [[La Santisima Church|La Santísima Trinidad]] and La Santa Cruz also requiring prompt attention to avoid collapse.  The San Lorenzo and Loreto churches both have had incidences where large pieces of the building, a stone and a window respectively, have fallen, causing damage but no injuries. Despite efforts by the archdiocese to demonstrate the extent of the damage of many of the churches, Conaculta still maintains that none of the buildings are in danger of coming down. Another problem is that the depopulation of the historic center, which leaves these churches fairly empty and the diocese unable to fund restoration work.&lt;ref name="torreon"/&gt;

===Revitalization===

[[File:TourbusDF.JPG|thumb|right|Double-decker tour bus near the Zocalo]]

Starting in the early 2000s, the government has infused 500 million Mexican pesos (55 million USD) into the Historic Center Trust&lt;ref name="belated"/&gt; and entered into a partnership with the ''[[Fundación Centro Histórico]]'', an organization established by [[Carlos Slim]], to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings for rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="facelift"/&gt; The significance of this effort was recognized when, in 2006, the Historic Center was included in the [[2006 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/mexico-city-historic-center World Monuments Fund - Mexico City Historic Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Work began with the renovation of 34 blocks just north of the Zocalo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply. An architect was put in charge of each of the thirteen main streets to restore the facades of more than 500 buildings.&lt;ref name="belated"/&gt; The latest infrastructure projects of this type have focused on the southwest portions of the area, on República de El Salvador, Talavera, Correo Mayor, Mesones and Pino Suárez streets, mostly focusing on repaving and improving the outdated drainage systems. In the process, artifacts dating from as early as the pre-Hispanic period have been unearthed.&lt;ref name="Jornada"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cruz |last=Alejandro |authorlink= |title=Arrasa con vestigios prehispánicos rescate del Centro Histórico |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2008/08/30/arrasan-con-vestigios-prehispanicos-obras-urbanas |work=La Jornada |date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306000040/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2008/08/30/arrasan-con-vestigios-prehispanicos-obras-urbanas |archivedate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All over the historic center, streets have been pedestrianized, buildings have been remodeled and restored, and new museums opened.  In the 1990s, after many years of controversy, protests and even riots, most street vendors were evicted to other parts of the city.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; The impetus to bring things back to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Zocalo.&lt;ref name="newface"/&gt; The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100 security cameras to help with crime issues.&lt;ref name="facelift"/&gt;   This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts.  To attract more tourists, there are new red double-decker buses.&lt;ref name="facelift"/&gt;

As of 2004, investment in the city center has climbed to over 5 billion pesos or 438 million U.S. dollars. According to the Historic Center of Mexico City Trust, this has led to the creation of 15,000 jobs and property owners in the area are showing interest in improving on their investments here. It has also attracted outside investment into the area.&lt;ref name="investment"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Notimex/Comtex |title=Investment in Historic Center of Mexico City climbs to 5bn pesos |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122383123.html |work=Highbeam Research |publisher=Internet Securities |date=2004-09-24 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ben Shepperd''' (October 19, 1915 – March 8, 1990)&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]], [[businessman]], and [[politician]] who served as the [[Secretary of State of Texas|Secretary of State]] (1950-1952) and [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] (1953–1957) for the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. During his tenure as Attorney General, Shepperd actively worked to oppose the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision mandating [[racial integration]] of public schools.&lt;ref name="ladino 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Howell /&gt;

==Early years==

Shepperd was born in Gladewater, a small town in [[Gregg County, Texas|Gregg County]] near the more populous [[county seat]] of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], to Alfred Fulton Shepperd and the former Berthal Phillips. He graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1938 and an [[LL.B.]] in 1941. He was made a partner in the law firm of Kenley, Sharp, and Shepperd in Longview. During [[World War II]], Shepperd served for two years in the [[United States Army]]. In 1946, on his release from the military, Shepperd was appointed to complete the term of his father, who had resigned, on the Gregg County Commissioners Court. In Texas, such appointments are made by the [[county judge]].&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt;

Shepperd rose to the top ranks of the [[Junior Chamber|Jaycees]], or Junior Chamber of Commerce, having served as both state and national presidents of the organization. On three occasions, he was named one of the "Outstanding Young Men in Texas". In 1949, he was named among the "Outstanding Young Men in America", along with future U.S. President [[Gerald R. Ford, Jr.]], of [[Michigan]] and later [[U.S. Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy]] of [[Illinois]]. Shepperd was allied with [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Allan Shivers]] and the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] wing of the then-dominant [[Texas Democratic Party]]. He often clashed with the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] wing headed by [[Ralph W. Yarborough]] of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], who would later become a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. In 1949, he served briefly under appointment from Shivers on the elected Texas State Board of Education. In 1950, Shivers appointed Shepperd [[Secretary of State of Texas]]. In that capacity, Shepperd organized an elections law task force and promoted measures to ensure economy in government.&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt;

==As attorney general==

===Racial Segregation===
In 1952, Shepperd was elected to the first of two two-year terms as [[Texas Attorney General]]. As his state's chief legal officer Shepperd led the fight against the 1954 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which mandated [[desegregation]] of public schools.

&lt;blockquote&gt;He accomplished this by delivering a pro-segregation [[amicus curae]] to the Supreme Court in October of 1954 in response to Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka, et al, the creation of an official pro-segregation policy for the Office of Attorney general of Texas, ... by networking with other states to strategize and create a hedgerow against integration of public schools, and when he wrote or organized legislation to impede the integration of public schools in Texas.&lt;ref name ="Howell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=Mark C.|title=John Ben Shepperd, Attorney General of the State of Texas: His role in the continuation of segregation in Texas, 1953-1957|journal=Master's Thesis|date=2003|publisher=University of Texas of the Permian Basin|location=Odessa, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Attorney General, Shepperd pursued numerous lawsuits against the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) that caused financial and political difficulties for the group, severely limiting the NAACP's ability to function in Texas. This included damaging their credibility, blocking their efforts to solicit people to file lawsuits, and creating the opportunity for the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to investigate them.&lt;ref name ="Howell" /&gt; Shepperd considered his efforts to restrict the activities of the NAACP in Texas as one of his greatest achievements as Attorney General.&lt;ref name="state historical society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shepperd, John Ben|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsh65|website=The Handbook of Texas|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepperd later researched and drafted several bills designed to frustrate integration, writing in February 1957 that he "drew up a group of segregation bills before [he] went out of office and they have already been introduced in the [[Texas Legislature]]".&lt;ref name ="Howell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=Mark C.|title=John Ben Shepperd, Attorney General of the State of Texas: His role in the continuation of segregation in Texas, 1953-1957|journal=Master's Thesis|date=2003|publisher=University of Texas of the Permian Basin|location=Odessa, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in Duval County===

Shepperd spearheaded an investigation of longstanding corruption in [[Duval County, Texas|Duval County]], the [[political machine]] province of [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]] (also known as "The Duke of Duval"), located in the barren dusty area east of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in south Texas. Shepperd's work produced some three hundred indictments of county and school officials.

===Other Significant Work===

As Attorney General, he led multiple investigations of [[Red Scare|alleged]] [[communism|communist]] infiltration of [[trade union]]s attempting to organize themselves in Texas.&lt;ref name="ladino 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ladino|first1=Robyn Duff|title=Desegregating Texas Schools: Eisenhower, Shivers, and the Crisis at Mansfield High|date=1996|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX|isbn=978-0292746923|pages=35–36|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3_I3r53r1VgC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shepperd exposed a scheme to defraud Texas of  [[tobacco tax]]es.&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt; He also defended Texas from questions raised by other states regarding the [[Submerged Lands Act|Submerged Lands Act of 1953]] ({{usc|43|1301}}), a federal law which allocated revenues from the [[tidelands]] to Texas. In 1956, Shepperd was elected by his forty-seven peers as president of the National Association of Attorneys General.&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt;

===Land Board Scandal===

In 1954, the [[Veterans' Land Board scandal]] shook the Shivers administration when it was revealed that certain corrupt land speculators tried to enrich themselves at public expense. [[Bascom Giles]], the elected commissioner of the [[Texas General Land Office]] and chairman of the [[Texas Veterans Land Board]], was indicted, convicted, and served a prison term for his role in the scandal. Neither Shivers nor Shepperd was implicated in the wrongdoing, but both as ''[[ex officio]]'' members of the land board had missed meetings where the abuses had occurred. Another scandal involved insurance companies accused of fraudulent activities. Shepperd had been expected to seek the gubernatorial nomination in 1956, but he left elected politics to become general counsel of Odessa Natural Gasoline Company, later El Paso Products Company, and to establish a new law firm there called Shepperd and Rodman.&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt; The governorship went to U.S. Senator [[Price Daniel]], who secured a narrow runoff victory over Ralph Yarborough. Yarborough in 1958 was elected to the first of two terms in the Senate, holding the seat that Daniel had vacated to become governor. Ironically, Daniel had also been Shepperd's predecessor as Attorney General.

==Civic leadership==

After his tenure as attorney general, Shepperd moved to Odessa, where he was active not only in law but also in [[insurance]], [[banking]], petrochemicals, public relations, and [[historical preservation]]. He was a political adviser and personal friend of [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In the middle 1960s, Shepperd was named trustee for the acquisition of land for the creation of [[Lyndon B. Johnson State Park and Historic Site]] along the [[Pedernales River]] in [[Gillespie County, Texas|Gillespie County]] in the [[Texas Hill Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/obituaries/john-ben-shepperd-ex-texas-official-74.html|title=

From 1963-1967, Shepperd headed the renamed [[Texas Historical Commission]] and supported the placement of more markers along highways to promote historical preservation. He served on the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. He pushed for the establishment in the late 1960s of the [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]].  One of his later accomplishments was the creation of the John Ben Shepperd Leadership Forum at UTPB, which assists students in developing the techniques to become effective leaders.&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt;

He was also involved in the planning and expansion of the [[Presidential Museum and Leadership Library]], an institution on the UTPB campus dedicated to the office of the presidency. The "Library of Presidents" at the museum is named in Shepperd's honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.presidentialmuseum.org/History_page.htm|title=History of the Presidential Museum and Leadership Library|publisher=presidentialmuseum.org|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1984, Shepperd was named "Texan of the Year" by the state Chamber of Commerce, and three years later, the West Texas chamber named him "Outstanding West Texan".&lt;ref name="state historical society" /&gt;

==Personal life==
On October 6, 1938, Shepperd married the former Mamie Strieber (December 30, 1917—January 9, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mamie Erna Strieber Shepperd's Obituary on|url = http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/oaoa/obituary.aspx?n=mamie-erna-strieber-shepperd&amp;pid=173826182|website = Odessa American|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Yorktown, Texas|Yorktown]] in [[DeWitt County, Texas|DeWitt County]] in southeastern Texas. The couple had two sons and twin daughters, John Ben, Jr. (November 13, 1942&amp;mdash;June 17, 1970),&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; Alfred, Marianne (September 2, 1948&amp;mdash;July 16, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-16883992.html {{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Suzanne. Shepperd was a member of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. He maintained residences in his native [[Gladewater, Texas|Gladewater]], Texas, and in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], Texas.

Shepperd died of [[cancer]] on March 8, 1990 at the age of 74 at his home in Gladewater. Shepperd, his son, and his daughter are interred at the private Shepperd family cemetery in Gladewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txgenes.com/TxGregg/Cemeteries/JohnShepperdCem.html|title=John Shepperd Cemetery|publisher=txgenes.com|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Kemény - Fürst von Siebenbürgen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johann Kemény]]

'''János Kemény''' (14 December 1607 in [[Bichiș|Magyarbükkös]] &amp;ndash; 23 January 1662 in [[Seleuş (Daneş)|Szásznagyszőllős]]) was a Hungarian aristocrat, writer and prince of [[Transylvania]].

János Kemény, offspring of a Transylvanian family of Hungarian aristocrats, held various political and military positions in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], during the reign of princes [[Gábor Bethlen]] and [[George I Rákóczi]]. As he writes, the family descends from Kemeny Simon, who disguised himself as [[Hunyadi János]] and was killed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] instead of his master. The story is recorded by [[Heltai Gaspar]]'s work, Magyar Cronica, a Hungarian translation/rewriting of the Latin of [[Antonio Bonfini]] published in 1560s.

Under [[George II Rákóczi]], he became the chief advisor of the prince, and leader of the military campaigns to [[Moldavia]] in 1653 and [[Poland]] in 1657, the latter being aimed at obtaining the Polish crown for Rákóczi. The Turks strongly opposed to Rákóczi's Polish ambitions and prohibited any military action. In the face of Turkish prohibition, Kemény also objected to the prince's ill-conceived Polish undertaking, and unwillingly took the leadership of the campaign that ended in disaster; Kemény's army, deserted by the Swedish allies, was captured by the Crimean Tatar allies of the Turks.

Kemény was held captive by the Tatars until August 1659, when he was released for a huge ransom. During his captivity in [[Bakhchisaray]] he wrote his Autobiography (in Hungarian), one of the most excellent masterpieces of the Transylvanian memoirist literature of the 17th century.

When he returned to Transylvania, he found a country torn by the ambitions of George II Rákóczi, unwilling to resign, a number of would-be princes, and a Turkish Porte vengeful for the unauthorized military campaign. The Sublime [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] now openly disregarded the Transylvanian Estates' right to elect the prince; Kemény saw this, and the successional invasions of Transylvania by the Turks and their Crimean Tatar allies, as an end of Transylvania's autonomy, which he thought could be prevented only with reliance on Habsburg help.

Kemény was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet on 1 January 1661, after Ákos Barcsai, backed up by the Turks, was forced to resign. In April 1661, the Transylvanian Diet, led by Kemény, proclaimed the secession of Transylvania from the Ottoman Empire and called on for help from Vienna. In turn, an overwhelming Turkish and Tatar army attacked Transylvania in June, defeating Kemény's army and driving him to Royal Hungary. The Turks installed [[Mihály Apafi]] as prince; Kemény, initially supported by Austrian general [[Raimondo Montecuccoli|Montecuccoli]] returned to Transylvania in early September. However, the Austrian army soon deserted him, and Kemény was killed by the Turks in the battle of Nagyszőllős.

His [[renaissance]] family castle is now in half-ruin, due to neglect of the government, in [[Medieșu Aurit|Aranyosmeggyes]] - visible from the main road [[Cluj-Napoca]]-[[Turda]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">'''John Philip Cohane''', born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] was an American author. He later moved to [[Ireland]] where he wrote books on [[etymology]] and [[Ancient astronaut]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Fitzgerald, Cosmic test tube: extraterrestrial contact, theories and evidence, Moon Lake Media, 1998, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Robins, Steven M. L. Aronson, ''Savage Grace: The True Story of Fatal Relations in a Rich and Famous American Family'', 2007, p. 488&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

Cohane published ''The Indestructible Irish'' in 1968 in which he proposed that the [[Irish people]]s were of 'Mediterranean origin’.&lt;ref&gt;Éire-Ireland: a journal of Irish studies, Volume 5; Volume 5, Irish American Cultural Institute., 1966, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he claimed that the original blood stock in [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] is [[Semitic people|Semitic]].&lt;ref&gt;The Critic, Volume 27, Issue 6, Thomas More Association, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Cohane also published ''The Key: A Startling Enquiry into the Riddle of Mans Past'', which claimed that before [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] eras two major worldwide Semitic migrations took place from the Mediterranean and scattered across the earth.&lt;ref name="Weigand"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: Reviewed Works: ''In Search of Noah's Ark'' by Dave Balsiger, Charles E. Sellier, Jr.; ''Remote Kingdoms'' by Tertius Chandler; ''The Key'' by John Philip Cohane; ''Gods of the Cataclysm: A Revolutionary Investigation of Man and his Gods before and after the Great Cataclysm'' by Hugh Fox |author=Phil C. Weigand |journal=American Anthropologist |series=New Series |volume=80 |issue=3 |date=September 1978 |pages=731–733 |jstor=677086 |doi=10.1525/aa.1978.80.3.02a00760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[linguist]] [[Cyrus Herzl Gordon]] was a friend of Cohane and wrote a preface to Cohane's book ''The Key'', Gordon was supportive of many of Cohane's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford, Antiquity: a quarterly review of archaeology, Volumes 51-53, Antiquity Publications, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Reprint bulletin, Volumes 23-24, American Library Association, Oceana Publications, 1978, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohane claimed that [[geographical]] names in [[United States|America]] have a Semitic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Herzl Gordon, Before Columbus; links between the Old World and ancient America, Crown, 1971, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that six word roots are found in most places names of most languages.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene R. Fingerhut, Explorers of pre-Columbian America?: the diffusionist-inventionist controversy, Regina Books, 1994, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Another claim by Cohane was that the [[Phoenicians]] adopted the [[alphabet]] from a prior Semitic culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/11_alphabet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Cohane published ''Paradox: The Case for the Extraterrestrial Origin of Man'' in which he claimed man is a product of interplanetary colonization (see [[Ancient astronauts]]).&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times book review, The New York Times Company, 1977 p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Cohane's controversial ideas were rejected by professional archaeologists and historians as "fantasy" and "[[pseudoscience]]".&lt;ref name="Weigand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gelb I. J | authorlink = Ignace Gelb | year = 1973 | title = Reviewed Work: The Key by John Philip Cohane | url = | journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 396–397 | doi=10.2307/599561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist Phil C. Weigand described ''The Key'' as a "fantasy masked as science" and suggested that the linguistic analysis is "methodologically unsound to be ever seriously considered."&lt;ref name="Weigand"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">[[File:Old Ashmolean 2006.JPG|thumb|C. H. Josten was [[Curator]] of the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] (above).]]

'''Conrad Hermann Hubertus Maria Apollinaris Josten'''&lt;ref name="lowe"&gt;Ian Lowe, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-kurt-josten-1413328.html Obituary: Kurt Josten], ''[[The Independent]]'', 12 July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (7 June 1912 in [[Neuss]], [[Germany]] – 10 July 1994 in Neuss), known as '''Kurt Josten''' or '''C. H. Josten''', was a [[historian of science]] and [[Curator]] of the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Simock (editor), ''Robert T. Gunther and the Old Ashmolean''. Oxford: [[Museum of the History of Science]], 1985. {{ISBN|0-903364-04-2}}. Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fox, [http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/1/69.short The history of science, medicine and technology at Oxford], ''[http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/ Notes &amp; Records of the Royal Society]'', vol. 60, no. 1, pp. 69–83, 22 January 2006. {{doi|10.1098/rsnr.2005.0129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 to 1929, Josten was educated by the [[Jesuit]]s at [[Bad Godesberg]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="lowe" /&gt; He studied for a year at the [[Staatliches Gymnasium]] in Neuss, followed by studies at the [[University of Geneva]],  [[University of Freiburg]], and  [[University of Bonn]]. In 1934 Josten worked in the office of the then Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], where he was involved in conservative plots to use the extensive powers of the aging President von Hindenburg - in particular his supreme command over the army - in order to stymie a complete grab of power by the Nazi members of the Government. When those aspirations came to a bloody end during the occupation of the Papen-Offices by the SS during the [[Night of the Long Knives]] on 30 June 1934, Josten scarcely managed to escape while his immediate superior [[Herbert von Bose]] was shot and other members of the Papen staff were arrested and taken to Lichtenburg Concentration Camp.

In 1935 Josten achieved a doctorate in law from the, [[University of Erlangen]]. However, he gave up law due to disillusionment about the state of law in Germany under the [[Nazi]]s. Also in 1935, he visited England, including [[Oxford]].

Jostem opposed Nazism from 1934 onwards and went into hiding in 1943 in [[Paris]], [[France]] and then [[Bavaria]] in Germany.  After [[World War II]], he returned to England and eventually became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] citizen in 1954.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E2D81F3FF93BA25754C0A962958260 Kurt Josten, 82, Headed the Museum of Science at Oxford], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Josten achieved a major scholarly success while working at the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford University]]'s main library. He discovered the code used by [[Elias Ashmole]] (the founder of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford) to encrypt his diaries. The decoded material was eventually published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Josten (editor), ''Elias Ashmole 1617–1692'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Josten became Curator of the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford in 1950. He was an expert on the early [[history of chemistry]] ([[alchemy]]), [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], and early astronomical instruments.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; He expanded the museum's collection through purchases and the major gift of the private collection of the shipping owner, [[Jack Billmeir]]. This consisted of astronomical and mathematical instruments. It was built up with the help of Josten.

On his early retirement in 1964 at the age of 52, he took an [[emeritus]] curatorial position at the museum. He encouraged his successor, [[Francis Maddison]], who was previously an assistant curator at the museum.

Kurt Josen was a member of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] (also the college of Elias Ashmole) and a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref name="lowe" /&gt;
He lived in rooms in [[St John Street, Oxford|St John Street]] in central Oxford. Josten married Constanze Josten in 1962. She died in 1968.

==Background==
The January 1986 overthrow of President [[Tito Okello]], an ethnic Acholi, by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) of south-west Uganda born [[Yoweri Museveni]] marked a period of intense turmoil. The NRA in their efforts to liberate the entire country meted out a lot of atrocities on the people of Acholi. This act spurred some Acholis to resist the medieval acts. The Acholi are sometimes said to have feared the loss of their traditional dominance of the national military; they were also deeply concerned that the NRA would seek retribution for the brutal [[counterinsurgency]], particularly the actions of the army in the [[Luwero triangle]].&lt;ref name=Luwerotriangle&gt;Doom, R. and K. Vlassenroot. "Kony's message: a new ''koine''? The Lord's Resistance Army in Northern Uganda," ''African Affairs'' 98 (390), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3462901.stm |title=BBC NEWS - World - Africa - Profile: Uganda's LRA rebels |accessdate=17 February 2008 |author=Martin Plaut |date=6 February 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August of that year, a full-blown popular insurgency had developed in northern regions that were occupied by the new government forces.

==Timeline==

===Early history (1987–1994)===
{{main|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency (1987–1994)}}
In January 1987, Joseph Kony made his first appearance as a spirit medium, one of many who emerged after the initial success of the [[Holy Spirit Movement]] of [[Alice Auma]]. Former [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] commander [[Odong Latek]] convinced Kony to adopt conventional [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, primarily surprise attacks on civilian targets, such as villages. The LRA also occasionally carried out large-scale attacks to underline the inability of the government to protect the populace. Until 1991 the LRA raided the populace for supplies, which were carried away by villagers who were abducted for short periods of  time. The fact that some NRA units were known for their brutal actions ensured that the LRA were given at least passive support by segments of the Acholi population.&lt;ref name="O'Kadameri"&gt;O'Kadameri, Billie. [http://www.c-r.org/accord/uganda/accord11/lra.shtml "LRA / Government negotiations 1993–94"] in Okello Lucima, ed., [http://www.c-r.org/accord/uganda/accord11/index.shtml ''Accord magazine: Protracted conflict, elusive peace: Initiatives to end the violence in northern Uganda''], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

March 1991 saw the start of "Operation North", which combined efforts to destroy the LRA while cutting away its roots of support among the population through heavy-handed tactics.&lt;ref name="Operation North"&gt;Gersony, Robert. [http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf The Anguish of Northern Uganda: Results of a Field-based Assessment of the Civil Conflicts in Northern Uganda]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117225143/http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf |date=17 November 2004 }}{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117225143/http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2004 |df=dmy }}  (PDF), US Embassy Kampala, March 1997, and [[Amnesty International]], [http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/uganda/document.do?id=25BBAD1C8FE337DF802569A600601142 Human rights violations by the National Resistance Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117225143/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/uganda/document.do?id=25BBAD1C8FE337DF802569A600601142 |date=17 November 2004 }}, December 1991.{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117225143/http://www.usaid.gov/regions/afr/conflictweb/reports/gersony/gersony_uganda.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2004 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Operation North, Acholi [[Betty Oyella Bigombe]], the Minister charged with ending the insurgency, created "Arrow Groups" mostly armed with bows and arrows, as a form of local defence. As the LRA was armed with modern weaponry, the bow-and-arrow groups were overpowered.

The creation of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel that he no longer had the support of the population. In response the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi whom they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.

[[File:Lira IDP camp makeshift shelters.jpg|thumb|left|The conflict forces many civilians to live in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps]]

Following the Operation North, Bigombe initiated the first face-to-face meeting between representatives of the LRA and government. The LRA asked for a general amnesty for their combatants and stated that they would not surrender, but were willing to "return home." However, the government stance was hampered by disagreement over the credibility of the LRA negotiators and political infighting. In particular, the military had learned that Kony was negotiating with the [[Sudan]]ese government for support while talking to Bigombe, and felt that Kony was simply trying to buy time.&lt;ref name="O'Kadameri"/&gt;

At a second meeting on 10 January 1994, Kony asked for six months to regroup his troops. By early February the tone of the negotiations was growing increasingly acrimonious, and following a meeting on 2 February, the LRA broke off negotiations stating that they felt that the NRA was trying to entrap them. Four days later, President [[Yoweri Museveni]] announced a seven-day deadline for the LRA to surrender.&lt;ref name="O'Kadameri"/&gt; This ultimatum ended the Bigombe Avengers Initiative.

===Spillover into neighboring countries (1994–2002)===
{{main|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency (1994–2002)}}
Two weeks after [[Yoweri Museveni|Museveni]] delivered his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, it was reported that LRA fighters had crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the [[Khartoum]] government.&lt;ref name="O'Kadameri"/&gt; Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) fighting in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] in the south of the country. Also, convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target civilians with his increased military strength. Mutilations became commonplace (especially cutting off ears, lips, nose), and 1994 saw the first mass abduction of children and youth.

The most famous of these was the [[Aboke abductions]] of 139 female students in October 1996. As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military offensive against the LRA is widely perceived by the Acholi as a massacre of victims. Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi. The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is central to the conflicted attitudes of many Acholi towards the rebels.

The government's response was a scorched-earth policy ordering all Acholis to leave their homes in 48 hours and move to "protected villages" beginning in 1996, later called Internally Displaced People's Camps. This further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi had toward the government, especially as the population continued to be attacked by the LRA even within the "protected camps." The camps were crowded, unsanitary, miserable places to live&lt;ref name=miserable_camps&gt;Dolan, Chris. [http://www.acord.org.uk/r-pubs-Cope%20Working%20Paper%2033.PDF What do you remember?

Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese government of the [[National Islamic Front]] began to recede from its previous hard-line stance. Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed. Cross-border tensions eased as support to proxy forces fell. Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians [[internally displaced person|displaced]] by the war began to return to their homes. The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the "protected camps" would be disbanded.&lt;ref name=Weeks_36&gt;Weeks, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Iron Fist and continued insurgency (2002–2005)===
[[File:Guard in Labuje IDP camp, Uganda.jpg|thumb|A government soldier guarding the Labuje IDP camp, [[Kitgum]], Uganda]]
{{main|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency (2002–2005)}}

In March 2002, the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]] (UPDF) launched a massive military offensive, named "Operation Iron Fist", against the LRA bases in southern Sudan, with agreement from the [[National Islamic Front]]. This agreement, coupled with the return of Ugandan forces that were deployed in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] upon the official end of the [[Second Congo War]], created what the Ugandan government felt was an ideal situation in which to end a conflict that had become both an embarrassment and political liability.&lt;ref name=not_rapid&gt;[http://www.plusnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=27970 UGANDA-SUDAN: No rapid solutions in anti-LRA campaign]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}, [[Integrated Regional Information Network|IRIN]] PlusNews, 27 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After several months of uncertainty, LRA forces began crossing back into Uganda and carrying out attacks on a scale and of a brutality not seen since 1995 to 1996, resulting in widespread displacement and suffering in regions, such as [[Soroti]], that had never previously been touched by the insurgency.&lt;ref name=RLP_30&gt;[http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf Behind the Violence: Causes, Consequences and the Search for Solutions to the War in Northern Uganda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927020617/http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf |date=27 September 2006 }}{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927020617/http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df=dmy }}  (PDF), [http://www.refugeelawproject.org/ Refugee Law Project] of [[Makerere University]], Uganda, February 2004, p. 32.{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927020617/http://www.refugeelawproject.org/papers/workingpapers/RLP.WP11.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of local initiatives spearheaded by traditional and religious leaders as well as diplomatic initiatives during these years failed, especially since Kony's negotiating position remained uncertain, but the conflict gained unprecedented international coverage. During a November 2003 field visit to Uganda, United Nations [[Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] stated, "I cannot find any other part of the world that is having an emergency on the scale of Uganda, that is getting such little international attention."&lt;ref name=BBC_worse&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3256929.stm Uganda conflict 'worse than Iraq'], [[BBC News]], 10 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Ugandan President Museveni referred the LRA to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) to determine if the LRA is guilty of international war crimes.

From the middle of 2004 on, rebel activity dropped markedly under intense military pressure. The government was also the target of increasingly pointed criticism from the international community for its failure to end the conflict. International aid agencies questioned the Ugandan government's reliance on military force and its commitment to a peaceful resolution. The army also admitted that it had recruited child soldiers who escaped the LRA into the military.&lt;ref name="recruiting_children"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4266789.stm Ugandan army recruiting children], BBC, 15 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-September 2005, a band of LRA fighters, led by [[Vincent Otti]], crossed into the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) for the first time. President Museveni declared that, if Congolese authorities did not disarm the LRA combatants, the UPDF would be sent across the border in pursuit.&lt;ref name="congo_militia"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4296948.stm DR Congo militia deadline expires], BBC, 30 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked a diplomatic row between the governments of the DRC and Uganda, with both militaries making a show of force along their border, while the Congolese ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter to the [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] demanding that an economic embargo be placed on Uganda in retaliation.

===Peace talks and truce (2006–2008)===
{{main|2006–2008 Juba talks}}
A series of meetings were held in Juba starting in July 2006 between the government of Uganda and the LRA. The talks were mediated by [[Riek Machar]], the Vice President of Southern Sudan,&lt;ref name="juba_8_june"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5060666.stm LRA rebels arrive for Sudan talks], BBC News, 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref name="Sant'Egidio"&gt;[http://santegidio.de/news/rassegna/2006/0820_004061_IT.htm "Guerra in Nord Uganda: la fine è a portata di mano"], [[Avvenire]], 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The talks, which resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance for a negotiated settlement since the peace initiative of [[Betty Bigombe]] in 1994.

These talks were agreed to after Joseph Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July.&lt;ref name="amnesty_rejection"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157220.stm Uganda LRA rebels reject amnesty], [[BBC News]], 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks,&lt;ref name="sudan_invitation"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54279 UGANDA: Gov't to send team to Sudan over proposed LRA talks], IRIN, 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 July 2006 talks began in Juba.&lt;ref name="Rugunda_comment"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607140756.html Ceasefire First On Kony Agenda], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5243038.stm LRA leaders declare ceasefire], BBC, 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4790049.stm Uganda hopeful about rebel talks], BBC News, 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The government and the LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces will leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas protected by the government of Sudan. The Ugandan government agreed not to attack those areas. LRA rebels had begun gathering in the assembly areas by mid-September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5337888.stm Uganda drops peace talks deadline], BBC, 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Talks continued to be hindered by demands and counter-demands. Meanwhile, the government began a process of creating "satellite camps" to decongest the main IDP camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55722 UGANDA: Most rebels have left northern Uganda for Sudan – army], IRIN, 26 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In broader context, the government of Southern Sudan viewed the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that was complicating its delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA was condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54920 UGANDA: Locals want rebel leader forgiven], IRIN, 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2007, thousands of IDPs had moved into the decongestion camps. However, the populace remained cautious about the prospect of a peace deal, with many refusing to return to their ancestral homes before a definitive end to the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72228 "UGANDA: IDPs begin slow journey home amid concerns over peace process"], ''IRIN'', 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a suspension in the peace talks, the [[Juba Initiative Project]] enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas, [[Joaquim Chissano]]. The talks were again mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan, but with the support of the United Nations and logistic facilitation from the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72489 "SUDAN-UGANDA: LRA talks, pencils and helicopters"], ''IRIN'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it was seeking legal advice on setting a [[war crime]]s court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6954860.stm |title=Uganda considers war crimes court |accessdate=20 August 2007 |work=BBC News | date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by Martin Ojul journeyed to Kampala to restate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness.  However, reports surfaced that LRA deputy commander Otti had been executed on or around 8 October 2007 over an internal power struggle with Kony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7082437.stm "Ugandan rebel deputy feared dead"] ''BBC News'', 7 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, diplomats reported that the Lord's Resistance army had bought new weapons and was recruiting new soldiers, adding 1,000 recruits to the 600 soldiers it already had. At about the same time, Uganda, South Sudan, and Congo-Kinshasa agreed to a plan to crush the movement together;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7440790.stm Ugandan rebels 'prepare for war'], ''BBC News'', 7 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the South Sudanese claimed that the rebels killed 14 of their soldiers on 7 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L07578542.htm Sudan says Uganda rebels kill troops, start "war"], ''Reuters'', 7 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act]] into law. In October 2011, Obama announced the deployment of 100 U.S. troops to aid other anti-LRA forces in subduing LRA leader Joseph Kony, citing the aforementioned act in a letter to the heads of both houses of [[US Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name="cnnusa" /&gt;

On 23 March 2012, the [[African Union]] announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops "from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony's reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony" and to "neutralize" him.

On 12 May 2012, Ugandan soldiers with the African Union brigade captured a senior LRA leader in the Central African Republic (CAR), Caesar Achellam, a veteran rebel commander with the rank of Major General. Because he was a leading military strategist for the LRA, Achellam's arrest signified a considerable setback for Joseph Kony's fight to evade capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uganda captures LRA senior commander |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18051522 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uganda captures Lord's Resistance Army commander |author=Justin Dralaze |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/05/13/uganda-lra-idINDEE84C04P20120513 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, the [[UN secretary general]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], released an initial report covering the activities of the LRA from 2009 to 2012. The report itself stated that "at least 45 children have been killed and maimed" during this time period and at least "591 children, including 268 girls have been abducted". Though it was noted by [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], the UN special representative on children and conflict, that the "actual numbers of abductions is much higher, these are just the ones we are aware of". It was also stated in the report that the LRA is currently made up of between 300–500 fighters, with around half of them being children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: Joseph Kony’s Lords Resistance Army Still Abducting Hundreds of Children |author=Anissa Haddadi |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/349663/20120607/jospeh-kony-s-lord-resistance-army-still.htm |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033749/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/349663/20120607/jospeh-kony-s-lord-resistance-army-still.htm |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony kidnapped 591 children in past three years, UN report reveals |author=David Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/joseph-kony-united-nations-report |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurgency was historically confined to the region known as [[Acholiland]], consisting of the districts of [[Kitgum]], [[Gulu]], and [[Pader District|Pader]], though since 2002 violence has overflowed into other Ugandan districts. The LRA also operated across the porous border region with [[Sudan|Southern Sudan]] and most recently into the northeastern [[Ituri Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The plight of the affected people has received little media coverage in the developed world. Not until April 2004 did the [[UN Security Council]] issue a formal condemnation. A 2005 poll of humanitarian professionals, media personalities, academics and activists identified the conflict in the north of Uganda as the second worst "forgotten" humanitarian emergency in the world, after the [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|conflicts of the neighbouring DRC]].&lt;ref name=forgotten&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/111038632791.htm WHO SAID WHAT: AlertNet ‘forgotten’ emergencies poll], [[Reuters]] AlertNet, 9 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government estimates that up to 12,000 people have been killed in the violence, with many more dying from disease and [[malnutrition]] as a direct result of the conflict. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to flee their homes, living in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps and within the safety of larger settlements, sleeping on street corners and in other public spaces. The problems of the camps have been expatiated by the government ordering villagers into the camps on pain of being classified as rebels and on occasion shelling those villages who refused to relocate.&lt;ref name=green88&gt;{{cite book | last = Green | first = Matthew | authorlink = Matthew Green (journalist)| title = The Wizard of the Nile: The Hunt for Africa's Most Wanted | publisher = Portobello Books | year = 2008 | isbn=978-1-84627-031-4| page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many abductees are taken to carry items looted from raided villages, some are also used as [[military use of children|soldiers]] and [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]]. The group performs abductions primarily from the [[Acholi people]], who have borne the brunt of the 18-year LRA campaign. The United Nations estimated in the mid-2000s that around 25,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA since 1987. However, several pieces of research have concluded that the figure was significantly higher. In June 2007, UC Berkeley's Human Rights Center researchers worked with reception centers in northern Uganda to compile a database of 25,000 former abductees that went through reception centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrc.berkeley.edu/pdfs/NUgandaReport2007.pdf |title=N Uganda Report 2007|format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By triangulating data from different sources on the number of former abductees, the research conservatively estimate that the LRA has abducted 24,000 to 38,000 children and 28,000 to 37,000 adults as of April 2006. The research further found that while women represented about a third of all the abductees, they tended to stay longer with the LRA compared to men. Women are forced to serve as sexual and domestic servants. According to a survey of 750 youth in Kitgum and Pader, at least 66,000 youth between the ages of 13 and 30 have been abducted. One-third of all boys and one-sixth of all girls had been taken for at least one day.&lt;ref name=SWAY1/&gt;&lt;ref name="sway-uganda.org"&gt;See also ''Figure 2: Distribution of LRA abduction over eight sub-counties, 1985 to 2005'', p. 2 of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060921111750/http://www.sway-uganda.org/SWAY.FinalReport.DRAFT.22Aug06.pdf The State of Youth and Youth Protection in Northern Uganda: Findings from the Survey for War Affected Youth (Phase 1 Final Report: Draft for Comments)], SWAY, August 2006 for a sense of the geographic shift in abductions over time&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these, 66% of males were taken for longer than two weeks, while the equivalent number for females was 46%. If a female was gone for more than two weeks, there was a one in four chance that she had not returned. Males were again found to be taken for longer periods of time on average, with two in five males that were abducted for more than two weeks not having returned. The number of abductions was greatest in 2002 and 2003, perhaps in retaliation for Operation Iron Fist. However, the average age of abductees has risen from about 13 in 1994 to nearly 18 in 2004, coinciding with the rise in number, and fall in length, of abductions.&lt;ref name=SWAY1/&gt;&lt;ref name="sway-uganda.org"/&gt;

While the LRA now appears to consist of less than two thousand combatants that are under intense pressure from the Ugandan military, the government has been unable to end the insurgency to date. Ongoing peace negotiations are complicated by an investigation and trial preparation by the [[International Criminal Court]]. Meanwhile, military operation is going on. The conflict continues to slow down Uganda's development efforts, costing the poor country's economy a cumulative total of at least $1.33 billion, which is equivalent to 3% of GDP, or $100 million annually.&lt;ref name=cost&gt;Jeff Dorsey and Steven Opeitum for the Civil Society Organisations for Peace in Northern Uganda (CSOPNU), [http://www.up.ligi.ubc.ca/economic%20cost%20of%20conflict%20final%20edited%20version%206%20oct%202002%5B1%5D.pdf The Net Economic Cost of the Conflict in the Acholiland Sub-Region of Uganda (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325152610/http://www.up.ligi.ubc.ca/economic%20cost%20of%20conflict%20final%20edited%20version%206%20oct%202002%5B1%5D.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}, Kampala, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Night commuters"===
[[File:Uganda night commuters - full room.jpg|thumb|A room of child "night commuters"]]

At the height of the conflict, each night, children between the ages of 8 and 14, referred to as "night commuters" or "night dwellers" would walk up to {{convert|20|km|mi}} from IDP camps to larger towns, especially [[Gulu]], in search of safety. To avoid abduction by the LRA, every night as many as 40,000 children fled their homes in the countryside to sleep in the relative safety of towns. Known as "night commuters", they seek refuge overnight at churches, hospitals, bus stations and temporary shelters before returning home again each morning.
Because of this phenomenon, united under the banner of peace, religious leaders from different denominations staged a one-week solidarity demonstration by sleeping in the streets with the children. This singular act created massive awareness of the conflict to the world.

===Awareness===
Initiatives to raise international awareness for these children included the "[[GuluWalk]]" and the work of the Resolve Uganda. Night commuters are also the subject of documentaries such as ''Stolen Children'', ''[[War/Dance]]'', and ''[[Invisible Children]]''.

The ''Invisible Children'' documentary sponsored the [[Global Night Commute]], an event similar to GuluWalk. On 29 April 2006, over 80,000 youths from around the world converged on urban centers in 130 major cities around the world in solidarity with displaced Ugandan children. The Invisible Children organization also raised awareness for those in the Internally Displaced Camps (IDPs) through its "Displace Me" event held in 15 cities across the US on 28 April 2007. Over 68,000 people participated in the event which required participants to sleep outside in "homes" made out of cardboard, similar to those in the IDPs.

Another program, The Name Campaign, asks people to wear nameplate necklaces imprinted with the first name of one of the thousands of abducted children as a means of raising public awareness.

[[Danny Glover]] and [[Don Cheadle]] have both been vocal advocates on behalf of the children of Northern Uganda.

On 5 March 2012, the Invisible Children organization posted the ''[[Kony 2012]]'' video on [[YouTube]] which was widely seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/citynews/10807 |title=Kony fever hits York! |accessdate=7 March 2012 |date=7 March 2012 |work=The Yorker |author=Neylon, Stephanie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308142114/http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/citynews/10807 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molloy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/892373-kony-2012-campaign-shedding-light-on-uganda-conflict-a-huge-online-success|title=Kony 2012: Campaign Shedding light on Uganda Conflict a Huge Online Success |accessdate=7 March 2012|date=7 March 2012|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|author=Molloy, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/07/kony-2012-invisible-children-documentary-sheds-light-on-uganda-conflict-video_n_1326183.html?ref=uk|title=Kony 2012: Invisible Children Documentary Sheds Light On Uganda Conflict |accessdate=7 March 2012|date=7 March 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|author= Nelson, Sara C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|6|17}}, the film had over 91 million views on video-sharing website [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc|title=Kony 2012|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this video came too late, as by this time the LRA was only a shadow of its former self, so it failed to have the relevance it could have had at an earlier time. In the end, it had little effect and there were no policy changes as a result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3669">The '''Mandé creation myth''' is the traditional [[creation myth]] of the [[Mandé peoples]] of southern [[Mali]].  The story begins when [[Mangala (Mandé)|Mangala]], the creator god, tries making a ''[[Faidherbia albida|balaza]]'' seed but it failed.  Then he made two [[eleusine]] seeds of different kinds, which the people of [[Keita Department|Keita]] call "the egg of the world in two twin parts which were to procreate".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then Mangala made three more pairs of seeds, and each pair became the four elements, the four directions, as corners in the framework of the world's creation. This he folded into a [[hibiscus]] seed.  The twin pairs of seeds, which are seen as having opposite sex, are referred to as the ''egg'' or ''placenta of the world''.  This egg held an additional two pairs of twins, one male and one female, who were the archetype of people.

Among them was [[Pemba (deity)|Pemba]] who wished to dominate and so he left the egg early, ripping a piece of his placenta.  Pemba fell through space and his torn [[placenta]] became the earth.  Because he left the egg prematurely the earth formed from this piece was arid and barren and of no use to Pemba. So Pemba tried to return to the egg, to rejoin his twin and his place in the rest of the placenta.  But it was not to be found-Mangala had changed the remaining placenta into the sun.  So Pemba stole male seeds from Mangala's [[clavicle]], and took them to the barren earth and planted them there.  Only one of them could germinate in the dry earth, a male eleusine seed which grew in the blood of the placenta.  But because Pemba had stolen the seed and it germinated in Pemba's own placenta, the earth became impure and the eleusine seed turned red.

[[Faro (mythology)|Faro]], the other male twin, who had assumed the form of twin fish, was sacrificed to atone for Pemba and purify the earth.  Faro was cut into sixty pieces which fell to the earth where they became trees.  Mangala restored Faro to life giving him now the form of a human, and sent him down to earth in an ark made from his placenta.  With him came four pairs of male and four pairs of female twins who became the original ancestors of mankind, all made from Faro's placenta.  The ark also held all the animals and plants, which also carried the male and female life force.  Sourakata followed with the first sacred drum made of the sacrificed Faro's skull which he played to bring rain.  When the rain did not come, the ancestral [[blacksmith|smith]] came to earth and with his hammer, he struck a rock and then the rain came.

Faro created all the world that mankind has come to know from the descendants of Mangala's original egg seeds.  He caused the land to flood to wash away the impure seed of his brother, Pemba.  From this flood, only the good were saved, sheltered by Faro's ark.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Professor Vető studied law at the University of Szeged. Because of his participation in the Revolution of 1956 he had to flee Hungary. As a refugee he was admitted to France in 1957.

== Philosophy ==
Vető's philosophy is coordinated along three interrelated foci:&lt;ref&gt;See Fernando Rey Puente, "L'Historiographie philosophique d'après Miklos Vetö," Iris: Annales de philosophie 27 (2006), 13-34.&lt;/ref&gt; 1. The History of Philosophy, particularly German Idealism (Kant, Hegel, Schelling). This is the central thread of his philosophical research. 2. The Philosophy of Religion, understood as the philosophical investigation of the intelligibility of Christian spirituality and theology. 3. A Constructive Metaphysics, concerned with the "enlargement" of philosophical reflection by intercourse with themes drawn from religion, art and ordinary experience.

Foci 1 and 2 have involved parallel developments through his career, whereas focus 3 has appeared central in publications since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See https://miklosveto.wordpress.com for a comparable summary presentation of his research.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''normal school''' is the historical term for an institution created to train high school graduates to be teachers by educating them in the norms of [[pedagogy]] and [[curriculum]]. Most such schools, where they still exist, are now denominated "teacher-training colleges" or "teachers' colleges" and may be organized as part of a comprehensive university. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', normal schools in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] trained teachers for [[Primary education|primary schools]], while in continental [[Europe]], the equivalent colleges educated teachers for primary, [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], founder of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]], founded what is generally considered the first normal school, the ''École Normale'', in [[Reims]], [[Champagne]], [[France]]. The term "normal" herein refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular ''norms'' within students. "Norms" included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum.

Educating teachers was of great importance in the newly industrialized European economies and their need for a reliable, reproducible and uniform work force. The process of instating such norms within students depended upon the creation of the first uniform, formalized national educational curriculum. Thus, normal schools, as the teacher training schools, were tasked with both developing this new curriculum and developing the techniques through which teachers would instill these ideas, behaviors and values in the minds of their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=H.A.|date=|title=The Normal-School Curriculum|url=|journal=The Elementary School Journal|volume=20|pages=276–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public normal school in the United States was founded in [[Concord, Vermont]], by [[Samuel Read Hall]] in 1823 to train teachers. In 1839, another normal school was established in the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]]; it evolved into [[Framingham State University]]. The first modern teacher training school in China was established by Qing educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]) in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uta.fi/cerec/educationandresearch/ChinaEduLecture/Teacher%20Education%20in%20China.pdf|title=Teacher Education in China :

Many comprehensive [[Public university|public or state-supported universities]], such as the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the United States and [[Beijing Normal University]] in China, were established and operated as normal schools before expanding their faculties and organizing as research universities. Some of these universities, particularly in Asia, retain the word "Normal" in their name to recognize their historical purpose. In Canada, most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education, offering a one or two-year [[Bachelor of Education]] degree. Such a degree requires at least three, but usually four, years of prior undergraduate study.

==Etymology==

The term "normal school" originated in the early 16th century from the French ''école normale''.&lt;ref name="Edwards1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Theory, History, and Practice of Education: Fin de siècle and a new beginning |journal=McGill Journal of Education |volume=26 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1991 |url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewFile/7991/5919 |author=Reginald Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French concept of an "école normale" was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers. The children being taught, their teachers, and the teachers of the teachers were often together in the same building.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although a [[laboratory school]], it was the official school for the children—primary or secondary.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History and modern teacher education ==

=== Europe ===

===== Finland =====
In Finland, normal schools are under national university administration, whereas most schools are administered by the local [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]]. Teacher aspirants do most of their compulsory trainee period in normal schools and teach while being supervised by a senior teacher.

===== France =====
In France, a two-tier system developed since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]: primary school teachers were educated at [[département]]al ''écoles normales'', high school teachers at the [[École normale supérieure|Écoles normales supérieures]]. Nowadays all teachers are educated in {{illm|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation|fr}} (Graduate School of Teaching and Education). The [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]] in France and the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in Italy no longer specialize in teacher training.

===== United Kingdom =====
In the United Kingdom, teacher training colleges were once separate institutions, and many such colleges adopted the title "College of Higher Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/Memories_of_Caerleon_-_final.pdf|title=Memories of Caerleon|publisher=[[University of South Wales]]|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A restructuring of higher education in the UK during the 1980s resulted in many of these adopting the status of "university". The [[University of Chester]] traces its roots back to 1839 as the earliest training college in the United Kingdom. Others were established by religious institutions and were single-sex until [[World War II]]. Since then, they have either become multi-discipline universities in their own right (e.g. University of Chester, [[St Mary's University, Twickenham]], [[Edge Hill University]]) or merged with another university to become its faculty of education (e.g. [[Moray House]]).

In [[Wales]], there were two colleges which included the word 'Normal' in their name: the first being 'The Normal College, Swansea' where the eminent mathematician [[John Viriamu Jones]] was educated and the second was [[Bangor Normal College|The Normal College, Bangor]] (founded 1858), which survived until 1996, when it became part of [[University of Wales Bangor]]. The latter was one of the last institutions in the UK to retain the word "Normal" in its name.

===== Lithuania =====
In Lithuania, [[Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences]] (LEU), former Vilnius Pedagogical University (VPU) is the main teachers' training institution, established in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leu.lt|title=Pradžia - Lietuvos edukologijos universitetas|first=Fresh|last=Media|date=|website=www.leu.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mainland China ====
In [[Mainland China]], the "normal school" terminology is still preserved in the official English names of former normal schools established in the late 19th and early 20th century, with [[Beijing Normal University]] being the oldest such school to have kept the term. The Chinese term ''normal university'' ({{zh|c=师范大学|p=shīfàn dàxué}}, abbreviated 师大; ''shīdà'') refers to a modern comprehensive university established as a normal school in the early twentieth century. These "normal universities" are usually controlled by the national or provincial government. In 1895, Qing banking tycoon and educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] gained approval from the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to establish the Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, China.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This comprehensive institution included the first normal school on the Chinese mainland. Since 1949, many former normal schools in China have developed into comprehensive research universities. As of 2012, [[East China Normal University]] and [[Beijing Normal University]], both members of the national government's [[Project 985]] program to build world-class universities, have been ranked the top two among the mainland Chinese universities that originated as normal schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2011-12/08/content_24105530_9.htm|title=Top 10 normal universities (teachers' colleges) in China - China.org.cn|first=|last=徐林|date=|website=www.china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan ====
In [[Taiwan]], three universities served as national normal universities historically. Located in [[National Taiwan Normal University|Taipei]], [[National Changhua University of Education|Changhua]], and [[National Kaohsiung Normal University|Kaohsiung]], the schools prepared [[secondary school]] teachers; these schools' missions have expanded since to make them ''de facto'' [[liberal arts]] universities. Ten Taiwanese teachers' colleges ({{zh|c=師範學院|p=shīfàn xuéyuàn}}, abbreviated 師院; shīyuàn, "normal colleges") originated as normal schools [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|established by the Japanese]]. After the [[Retrocession Day|end of World War 2]] these were reorganized as provincial normal schools by the Kuomintang and then as provincial teachers' colleges. With the arrival of pluralistic [[democracy]] in the early 1990s these colleges came under national control, and by the mid-2000s (decade) all had been renamed as "universities of education" (教育大學) or simply "universities" to signify their more comprehensive missions.

==== Philippines ====
In [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], one can find the oldest normal school for girls in the Far East, the [[Universidad de Santa Isabel]]. It is a sectarian school run by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]].  The first secular normal school was founded in 1901 by the [[Thomasites]], the Philippine Normal School.  It was converted into a college in 1949 and was elevated to its present university status in 1992 as the [[Philippine Normal University]].  In 2009, it was named National Center of Excellence for Teacher Education by virtue of Republic Act 9647. In [[Iloilo City]], the [[West Visayas State University]] was originally established as a normal school in 1902; in 1994, it was recognized by the Philippines government as a Center for Teaching Excellence.

==== Malaysia ====
In [[Malaysia]], the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] runs a total of 27 Institutes of Teacher Education (ITEs), which were formerly known as Teacher Training Colleges. These ITEs function primarily to educated both undergraduate and postgraduate teacher trainees. The ministry bureau responsible for overseeing them is the [[Teacher Education Division]]. The ITEs also run in-service teacher training and continuous professional development among qualified teachers.

=== Oceania ===

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, the term ''normal school'' can refer to a primary or intermediate school used for teacher training, such as the [[Epsom Normal Primary School]] (in Auckland), [[Kelburn Normal School]], [[Palmerston North Intermediate Normal School]], [[Papakura Normal School]] or [[Tahuna Normal Intermediate School]]. They were associated with a teachers' training college, such as the [[Auckland Teachers' Training College]], which became colleges of education that trained secondary as well as primary and intermediate school teachers.

===North America===

====Jamaica====
[[Mico University College]] is the oldest teacher training institute in the [[English-speaking]] world outside of Europe.  It was founded under [[Lady Mico Charity]] in 1834 by [[Fowell Buxton|Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton]] "to afford the benefit of education and training to the black and coloured population."  Today, it offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of education and liberal arts disciplines.

====1823 - Columbian School in Concord, Vermont====

In 1823, Reverend [[Samuel Read Hall]] founded the first normal school in the United States, the Columbian School in [[Concord, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html Samuel Read Hall Biography at the Old Stone House Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405231650/http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html |date=2010-04-05 }}, Retrieved on 2009-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="melrosemirror.media.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920192639/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-09-20|title=An early Yankee Educator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by similar academies in [[Prussia]] and elsewhere in Europe, American normal schools were intended to improve the quality of the burgeoning [[common school]] system by producing more qualified teachers. Hall also founded the first normal schools in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="melrosemirror.media.mit.edu"/&gt;  The school was renamed Concord Academy before closing after seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/crs/?Page=resources/profiles/Concord/human.htm|title=Center for Rural Studies : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Simon W Robinson Masonic Lodge, Lexington MA.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Site of the first public normal school&lt;br&gt;in the United States,&lt;br&gt;in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Sixteen years after Columbian School had been founded in Vermont, the first state-funded normal school was founded in the neighboring state of [[Massachusetts]], thanks largely to the efforts of [[education reform]]ers such as [[Horace Mann]] and [[James G. Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/normal.html Normal Schools - History of American Education Web Project], Retrieved on 2007-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its founding that school moved from its original site of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] to [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]]. Today, [[Framingham State University]] is recognized as the oldest, continuously operated public normal school in the United States. [[Anna Brackett]] attended this University and was a teacher - later to become the first woman principal of a teacher's college.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=199, item #3264 ''The first teacher training school principal who was a woman was Anna Callender Brackett, who on January 5, 1863, took charge of the St.Louis Normal School, St. Louis, MO''}}{{sfn|Rogers|2005|p=73 ''Anna Brackett was the first woman in the US to be appointed principal of a secondary school, the St. Louis Normal School in 1863'' }}

====1849 - State Normal School, New Britain, Connecticut====

The State Normal School in New Britain was founded in 1849. It was the first training school for teachers in the state of Connecticut. The school is now [[Central Connecticut State University]].

====1853 - Michigan State Normal School====

The first normal school west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the United States was the Michigan State Normal School, now [[Eastern Michigan University]]. It was created by legislative action in 1849 and opened in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], in 1853.&lt;ref name='EMU'&gt;

====1854 - Rhode Island State Normal School====

When the college was established in 1854 as the Rhode Island State Normal School, its goal was to provide teacher preparation to young people from Rhode Island. With the dedication of a new building in 1898, the institution began a period of steady growth, evolving first into a teachers' college, the Rhode Island College of Education. In the 1958-59 academic year the college moved to its current Mount Pleasant campus, and in 1959 was renamed [[Rhode Island College]] to reflect its new purpose as a comprehensive institution of higher education. With an enrollment predominantly from Rhode Island and nearby Massachusetts and Connecticut, the institution historically has served as a "College of Opportunity" for first-generation college students.

====1854 -  Salem Normal School, Salem, Massachusetts ====

Salem Normal School, now [[Salem State University]], was founded in 1854 as the fourth Normal School in [[Massachusetts]]. In 1853, the General Court authorized the founding of a normal school in Essex County. Proposals were received from Salem, Chelsea, Groveland, and North Andover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitman|first1=J. Asbury|title=The Salem Normal School: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=February 1930|volume= 30|issue=6|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] was selected due to many factors including the city's historical and commercial significance and need for local teacher education.

Prior to the founding of the normal school, Salem women had few opportunities to receive teacher training and the Salem school system was replete with funding, attendance, and teacher compensation problems. It was assumed that by training women as teachers, they could be hired at a lower salary than male teachers, thus alleviating the city's public school budget and teacher compensation challenges.

The original location was at the corner of Broad and Summer Streets, with the building's dedication held on September 14, 1854. Richard Edwards, a graduate of Bridgewater Normal School (now [[Bridgewater State University]]), was the first president of Salem Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Joan|title=Salem Normal School 1854-1905: A Tradition of Excellence|year=1990|publisher=Tapestry Press|location=Acton, MA|isbn=0-924234-31-8|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857 and the offer from Bloomington, Illinois, was accepted. The normal school was located near the village of North Bloomington, which later was renamed ''Normal'' in honor of the school. The school, originally known as Illinois State Normal University (ISNU), is now known as [[Illinois State University]].

In 1915 a second Provincial Normal School opened in Victoria. Trainee teachers from greater Vancouver and the lower Mainland attended the Normal School in Vancouver. Students from [[Vancouver Island]] and students outside the [[Lower Mainland]], that is, from the Upper Fraser Valley and communities in the interior of the province – enrolled in the Normal School in Victoria.  That school was originally located in [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]] and later in its own building which is now part of [[Camosun College]]. In 1956 the responsibility for provincial teacher training was transferred to The [[University of British Columbia]].

====Manitoba====
Central Normal School was founded in 1882 in [[Winnipeg]]. In 1905-06 a new building was constructed at 442 William Avenue.

[http://www.societyforqualityeducation.org/teachers/kymlicka.pdf The faculty of education: An interpretation of history and purposes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227040759/http://www.societyforqualityeducation.org/teachers/kymlicka.pdf |date=2007-02-27 }} Retrieved on 2008-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Bay Normal School, a teacher training school, was established in 1909 in North Bay Ontario to meet the needs of teacher education in Ontario's North. The school was renamed North Bay Teachers' College in 1953, and became Nipissing University College's faculty of education in August 1973. After the university received a prestigious award in 2010, the Faculty of Education was renamed the Schulich School of Education. See [[Nipissing University]].

A school of pedagogy was formed in association with [[Toronto Normal School]], offering advanced level courses suitable for high-school teachers. In 1897, the school was moved to Hamilton and renamed Ontario Normal College. The college closed in 1906 and the training was taken over by the faculties of education at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Queen's University]] in Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;Dundurn (2011), ''Education and Ontario Family History'', Marian Press, p. 102,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottawa Normal School]] was built in 1874 and opened in 1875. It was located at 195 Elgin Street. It was renamed the Ottawa Teacher's College in 1953, and was subsequently merged into the Faculty of Education of the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1974.

The site was maintained, and was home to the Stratford Perth Museum for a number of years, being renamed the Discovery Centre.  The museum moved to another location, however, and the building is now leased by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and has been named once again the Normal School Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2013/03/14/city-council-being-asked-to-change-discovery-centre-name|title=Return to Normal School name in works|first=|last=nurun.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prince Edward Island====

====Saskatchewan====
The Saskatchewan Normal School, also once known as the Regina Normal School, was founded as early as 1890 in Regina moving into its first permanent structure in January, 1914.  In 1964 it was transferred to [[University of Saskatchewan]] Regina Campus and in 1974 becoming part of the [[University of Regina]].  Another normal school was founded in the early 1920s in Moose Jaw and was later transferred into the Regina campus in 1959.

The [[Saskatoon Normal School]] in [[Saskatoon]] was founded in 1912 and served until 1953. It has now been integrated with the Faculty of Education at [[University of Saskatchewan]].

===Latin America===
Early normal schools in [[Latin America]] include several in Mexico, such as the ''Escuela Normal de Enseñanza Mutua de Oaxaca'' (1824), the ''Escuela Normal Mixta de San Luis Potosí'' (1849), the Normal de Guadalajara (1881), and the ''Escuela Normal para Profesores de Instrucción Primaria'' (1887). The Mexican normal school system was nationalized and reorganized by the ''[[Secretariat of Public Education|Secretaría de Educación Pública]]'' (Secretariat of Public Education) under [[José Vasconcelos]] in 1921.

Perhaps the oldest continually operating normal school in Latin America is the Escuela Normal Superior José Abelardo Núñez, founded in [[Santiago, Chile]], in 1842 as the Escuela de Preceptores de Santiago under the direction of the emininent [[Argentina|Argentine]] educator, writer, and politician [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. The first normal school in the [[Dominican Republic]] was founded in 1875 by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] educator and activist [[Eugenio María de Hostos]].

In Argentina, normal schools were founded starting in 1852, and still exist today and carry that name. Teachers' training is considered higher education and requires a high school diploma, but normal schools have the particularity of granting five year teacher degrees for primary school or four year degrees for kindergarten, while at the same time hosting secondary, primary school students, and kindergarten and pre-school. Teachers-to-be do intense practical training in the schools annexed to the higher education section. This is the main difference with other teachers' training institutions called Instituto de Formación Docente and with universities that grant teaching degrees.

Other Latin American nations have long traditions of normal schools. In Panama, the Escuela Normal Juan Demóstenes Arosemena was founded in [[Santiago de Veraguas]], [[Panama]] in 1938. In [[Colombia]], normal schools were primarily associated with women's religious schools although in modern times have admitted men, thus forming ''escuelas normales mixtas'' (mixed normal schools). In [[Paraguay]], they are known as Instituto de Formación Docente.

'''Reclaim The Records''' is a non-profit organization and activist group that advocates for greater transparency and accessibility for [[Genealogy|genealogical]], [[Archives|archival]], and [[vital record]]s in the United States. They use state [[Freedom of information in the United States|Freedom of Information requests and lawsuits]] to force government agencies, archives, and libraries to provide copies of previously inaccessible records to the public. Reclaim The Records then digitizes and publishes the records online for free public use, without any copyrights or usage restrictions.&lt;ref name="NJTrue"&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2017/05/group_looks_to_open_access_to_genealogy_records.html|title=Group looks to open access to genealogy records|last=Klein|first=Daniel|website=NJ.com True Jersey|date=May 5, 2017|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaim The Records is the first genealogical organization to successfully sue a government agency for the release of records back to the public. As of December 2017, the organization has acquired and freely published more than twenty million records, most of which had never been open to the public before in any location or format, or else were only available in very outdated formats such as microfiche in limited locations but had never gone online before.

==History==
Reclaim The Records was founded by Brooke Schreier Ganz, a technologist and long-time amateur genealogist. While living in California, Ganz had become increasingly frustrated by the lack of online access to [[New York City]] and [[New York (state)|New York State]] archival records. Almost none of the New York records had been put online by their respective city or state government archives or agencies, nor were the records available to search or to view through any genealogy websites, whether for-profit or non-profit. A small subset of the basic vital records index data was available to the public, but only if one was physically onsite in New York records repositories, and only in outdated formats such as [[microfilm]] and [[microfiche]].

After unsuccessfully attempting to use New York City's [[open data]] law, Local Law 11 of 2012, to compel the publication of the basic indices to these records, Ganz decided to use the state's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) to force the release of copies. She made a [[FOIL request]] of the [[New York City Municipal Archives]] in January 2015, which was initially agreed to and then denied by the city.&lt;ref name="NJTrue"/&gt; This led to an Article 78 lawsuit in the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court of New York]] that August. Not wanting to sue the city with just her name on the case, Ganz created Reclaim The Records as an organization so that they could both be listed as Petitioner on the case. The city settled the case five days before they were due in court, and Ganz won the first public copies of the index to New York City marriage licenses for 1908-1929 on 48 rolls of microfilm.

In January 2016, Reclaim The Records filed another FOIL request that became another Article 78 lawsuit, this time filed against the New York City Clerk's Office. They too settled with the group, providing 110 reels of microfilm and copies of a digital database they had created for in-house use.  The city also paid the organization's attorneys fees.

In November 2016, Reclaim The Records filed a third lawsuit under the Missouri Sunshine Law against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for access to the basic index to births and deaths in the state. During the course of the lawsuit, it was discovered that the Missouri DHSS had been selling this same data to researchers for years, but was unwilling to provide copies to the public.

'''Rescue – The British Archaeological Trust''' is a charitable organisation in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1971 as a [[pressure group]] by a team including the archaeologists [[Margaret Ursula Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/02/guardianobituaries.education|title=Margaret Jones|date=2001-05-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philip A.

The Trust campaigns for government funds to permit the excavation of archaeological sites in advance of road-building, construction or other development.

'''Richard Grunberger''' (7 March 1924 [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] – 15 February 2005) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] historian, who specialised in study of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nazi psychoanalysis|first=Laurence A. |last=Rickels|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year= 2002|ISBN= 0-8166-3697-4|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothenberg"&gt;{{cite news

He was born in Austria to [[Jewish]] parents. After the 1938 [[Anschluss]] with [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's Germany]], he was put on the first [[Kindertransport]] train to leave [[Vienna]]. He was initially housed in a [[refugee]] camp at [[Lowestoft]] in [[England]]. After this he lived with a Jewish family, who were West End tailors in [[London]]. Grunberger entered their tailoring business. His desire for education however led to his taking A levels at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck college]]. He gained an [[Exhibitioner|exhibition]] scholarship in history at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name = "Rothenberg"/&gt;

When he went to the [[Wiener Library]] in London, he expressed to a friend his frustration at the absence of a book that held together the masses of documentation surrounding [[Nazism]] and 20th-century [[Germany]]. A friend asked why he did not write one, and so he did. The product was ''A Social History of the Third Reich'', first published in 1971 by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. It has since become a significant text for studying the social history of Nazi Germany in schools and at undergraduate level.&lt;ref name = "Rothenberg"/&gt;

Initially, much of Grunberger's leisure time in Britain was taken up by the [[communist]] youth group [[Communist Youth of Austria — Young Left|Young Austria]]. In spite of this, his political outlook was [[social democratic]].&lt;ref name = "Rothenberg"/&gt;

'''Ruth Dudley Edwards''' (born 24 May 1944, in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an Irish writer.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Edwards, Ruth. "Confessions of an Irish Revisionist" in (Homberger, Eric; Charmley, John ed.  "The Troubled face of biography") New York : St. Martin's Press, (1988). {{ISBN|9780312013295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Cite tweet |user=ruthde |number=668816347774754816 |date = 23 November 2015 |title=Every historian should be a revisionist, i.e. someone who constantly revises opinions in the light of new evidence  }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.ie/article/76386 Ruth Dudley Edwards urges Queens University audience to ignore 'well known eccentric']&lt;/ref&gt; One of several positions she holds is columnist with the Irish ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.

==Background==
Dudley Edwards was born and brought up in [[Dublin]] and educated at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), [[Girton College, Cambridge]], and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]]. Her father was the Irish historian Professor [[Robert Dudley Edwards]]. Her brother [[Owen Dudley Edwards]] is a historian at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1965, she married a fellow UCD graduate, the journalist [[Patrick Cosgrave]]. They later divorced.

Her grandmother, [[Bridget Dudley Edwards]], was an [[Dublin Women's Suffrage Association|Irish suffragette]] and a member of [[Cumann na mBan]], a women's organisation designed to support the [[Irish Volunteers]]. Members of Cumann na mBan gathered intelligence, transported arms, nursed wounded men, provided safe houses, and organised support for IRA men in prison. They also boosted attendance at election rallies, funerals and protest marches. In 1922 the organisation overwhelmingly rejected the Treaty.

==Works==
Her non-fiction books include ''An Atlas of Irish History'', ''[[James Connolly]]'', ''[[Victor Gollancz]]: A Biography'' (winner of the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]]), ''The Pursuit of Reason: [[The Economist]] 1843–1993'', ''The Faithful Tribe: An Intimate Portrait of the Loyal Institutions'' (shortlisted for [[Channel 4]]/[[The House Politico]]'s Book of the Year) and ''Newspapermen: [[Hugh Cudlipp]], [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]] and the glory days of Fleet Street''. Her ''[[Patrick Pearse]]: The Triumph of Failure'' (winner of the National University of Ireland Prize for Historical Research), first published in 1977, was reissued in 2006 by [[Irish Academic Press]]. In 2009 she published ''Aftermath: The Omagh Bombings and the Families' Pursuit of Justice'' a book about the civil case that was won on 8 June 2009 against the [[Omagh bombing#Prosecutions and court cases|Omagh bombers]]. ''The Faithful Tribe'' was criticised by [[Ulster Protestant]] journalist Susan McKay as "sentimental and blinkered",&lt;ref&gt;Susan McKay ''Northern Protestants'' p.138&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[New Statesman]]'' contributor Stephen Howe described it as "engrossing and illuminating"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/135106]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Irish Independent]] journalist [[John A. Murphy]] described it as "enormously readable, entertaining and informative", but "[her argument] 'extremely disingenuous'", and he quotes Othello, 'The lady doth protest too much, methinks', when describing one of her counter-arguments as 'exaggerated'. He added "Historically in Ireland, Protestant `liberties' tended to mean Protestant `privilege,' and many Protestants (even including some United Irishmen) doubted whether Roman Catholics were constitutionally capax libertatis capable of appreciating or enjoying liberty at all, because of Roman tyranny and priest-craft. In short, the Orange Protestant is still benightedly living in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the Southern Catholic, whatever his past intolerances, has moved on.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/the-orangeman-as-decent-skin-26260130.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 she published ''The Seven: The Lives and Legacies of the Founding Fathers of the Irish Republic'' (Oneworld), a re-examination of the [[Easter Rising]], addressing the fundamental questions and myths surrounding the 1916 leaders.

Also a crime fiction writer, her novels include: ''Corridors of Death'', ''The Saint Valentine's Day Murders'', ''The English School of Murder'', ''Clubbed to Death'', ''Matricide at St. Martha's'', ''Ten Lords A-Leaping'', ''Murder in a Cathedral'', ''Publish and Be Murdered'', ''Anglo-Irish Murders'', ''Carnage on the Committee'', ''Murdering Americans'', and ''Killing the Emperors''.

==Criticism of Ken Loach==
Following the Cannes prize announcement, for ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', Ruth Dudley Edwards wrote in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 30 May 2006 that [[Ken Loach|Loach]]'s political viewpoint "requires the portrayal of the British as sadists and the Irish as romantic, idealistic resistance fighters who take to violence only because there is no other self-respecting course,"&lt;ref name="Dudley Edwards Mail"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388256/Why-does-Ken-Loach-loathe-country-much.html "Why does Ken Loach loathe his country so much?"] ''The Daily Mail'', 30 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked his career in an article.&lt;ref name="Loach in Indymedia"&gt;[http://ireland.indymedia.org/article/76396 "Ken Loach hits back at English tabloids"] Indymedia Ireland, 1 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Edwards continued her attack in ''[[The Guardian]]'', admitting that her first article was written without seeing the film (which at that stage had only been shown at Cannes), and asserting that she would never see it "because I can't stand its sheer predictability."&lt;ref name="Dudley Edwards Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jun/06/whataboutmakingblackandta "What about making Black and Tans: the movie?"] ''The Guardian'', 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudley Edwards has stated that she is "not in principle against [[Irish unification]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/irishness-can-truly-be-a--many-splendoured-thing-1428412.html Irishness can truly be a many splendoured thing], [[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]], 6 July 2008, p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6241">'''Sebeos''' ({{Lang-hy|Սեբեոս}}) was a 7th-century [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[bishop]] and historian.

Little is known about the author, though a signature on the resolution of the [[Fourth Council of Dvin|Ecclesiastical Council of Dvin]] in 645 reads 'Bishop Sebeos of Bagratunis.' His writings are valuable as one of the few intact surviving sources that chronicle sixth century Armenia and its surrounding territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacikyan|first1=Agop|last2=Basmanjian|first2=Bagriel|last3=Franchuk|first3=Edward|last4=Ouzounian|first4=Nourhan|title=The Heritage of Armenian Literature Volume II|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=0-8143-3023-1|pages=82|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2gZzD0N9Id8C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=sebeos#v=onepage&amp;q=sebeos&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 March 2015|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Sebeos contains detailed descriptions from the period of [[Marzpanate Period|Sassanid supremacy in Armenia]] up to the [[Arab conquest of Armenia|Islamic conquest]] in 661. His history was published for the first time in 1851 in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacikyan|first=Jack|title=The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the sixth to the Eighteenth Century|pages=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2gZzD0N9Id8C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=sebeos#v=onepage&amp;q=sebeos&amp;f=false|isbn=0814330231|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
To him has been attributed the ''A History of [[Heraclius]]'', chronicling events from the end of the fifth century to 661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ararat, Volume 27|publisher=Armenian General Benevolent Union|pages=16}} to him&lt;/ref&gt; The first section begins with the mythical foundation of Armenia with the [[Hayk|Legend of Hyke and Bel]], moving to contemporary history with the ascent of Vardan II Mamikonian in 570. From there, he relates the struggles and alliances between Persia and Byzantium.

The second section narrates the ascent of a new political and military force, the [[Ishmaelites]] (i.e. Arabs).

{{quotebox|Twelve peoples representing all the tribes of the [[Jews]] assembled at the city of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. When they saw that the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] troops had departed leaving the city in peace, they closed the gates and fortified themselves. They refused entry to troops of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman]] lordship. Thus [[Heraclius]], emperor of the Byzantines, gave the order to besiege it. When the Jews realized that they could not militarily resist him, they promised to make peace. Opening the city gates, they went before him, and [[Heraclius]] ordered that they should go and stay in their own place. So they departed, taking the road through the desert to Tachkastan [[Arabia]] to the sons of [[Ishmael]]. The Jews called the [[Arabs]] to their aid and familiarized them with the relationship they had through the books of the [[Old Testament]]. Although the Arabs were convinced of their close relationship, they were unable to get a consensus from their multitude, for they were divided from each other by religion. In that period a certain one of them, a man of the sons of [[Ishmael]] named [[Historicity of Muhammad#Non-Muslim_sources|Mahmed]], became prominent. A sermon about the Way of Truth, supposedly at God’s command, was revealed to them, and Mahmed taught them to recognize the God of [[Abraham]], especially since he was informed and knowledgeable about [[Moses|Mosaic]] history. Because the command had come from on High, he ordered them all to assemble together and to unite in faith. Abandoning the reverence of vain things, they turned toward the living God, who had appeared to their father–Abraham. Mahmed legislated that they were not to eat carrion, not to drink wine, not to speak falsehoods, and not to commit adultery. He said: “God promised that country to [[Abraham]] and to his son after him, for eternity. And what had been promised was fulfilled during that time when [[God]] loved [[Israel]]. Now, however, you are the sons of Abraham, and God shall fulfill the promise made to Abraham and his son on you. Only love the God of Abraham, and go and take the country which God gave to your father Abraham. No one can successfully resist you in war, since God is with you."}}

This section describes how Mahmed first established a community comprising [[Ishmaelites]] and [[Jews]] based on their common descent from [[Abraham]]; the Arabs via [[Ishmael]], and the Jews via [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard-Johnston|first1=James|title=The Armenian History Attributed to Sebeos|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=0-85323-564-3|pages=li|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YzsVvsMsuBUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sebeos#v=onepage&amp;q=ishmael&amp;f=false|date=1999-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the Ishmaelites made dramatic territorial gains, including their victory over the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian dynasty]], and the narrative ends with the division of the Ishmaelite armies and the beginnings of the [[First Fitna]]. He relates these developments to Armenia.

[[File:SempadLetter.JPG|thumb|A 14th century copy of the February 7, 1248, letter of Sempad to [[Henry I of Cyprus]] and [[John of Ibelin (jurist)|John of Ibelin]], stating that "If God hadn't brought the Tartars who then massacred the pagans, they [the Sarasins] would have been able to invade the whole land as far as the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Mutafian. ''Le Royaume Armenien de Cilicie'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was also shown to Louis IX.]]
'''Sempad the Constable''' ({{lang-hy|Սմբատ Սպարապետ, Սմբատ Գունդստաբլ|translit=Smbat Sparapet, Smbat Gúndestabl}}) (1208–1276) (also '''Smpad''' and '''Smbat''') was a noble in [[Cilician Armenia]], an older brother of King [[Hetoum I]]. He was an important figure in Cilicia, acting as a diplomat, judge, and military officer, holding the title of Constable or ''[[Sparapet]]'', supreme commander of the Armenian armed forces. He was also a writer and translator, especially known for providing translations of various legal codes, and the creation of an important account of Cilician history, the ''Chronique du Royaume de Petite Armenie'' (''Chronicle of the Kingdom of Little Armenia''). He organized and fought in multiple battles, such as the [[Battle of Mari]], and was trusted by his brother King Hetoum to be a key negotiator with the [[Mongol Empire]].

==Biography==
At the time of Sempad's birth there were two key dynasties in Cilicia, the [[Rubenids]] and the [[Hetoumids]], and he was related to both. Sempad was the son of [[Constantine of Baberon]] and Partzapert (third cousin of [[Leo II of Armenia]]). Other siblings included John the Bishop of Sis, Ochine of Korykos, Stephanie (later wife of King [[Henry I of Cyprus]]), and Hetoum, who became co-ruler in 1226. The earlier ruler had been [[Queen Isabella of Armenia]], who was married to Philip, son of [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]].  Constantine arranged for Philip to be murdered in 1225, and forced Isabella to then marry his son Hetoum on June 4, 1226, making him the co-ruler, and then sole ruler after Isabella's death in 1252.

==Historical context==
Cilicia was a Christian country, that had ties to Europe and the Crusader States, and fought against the Muslims for control of the [[Levant]].  The Mongols were also a threat, as [[Genghis Khan]]'s Empire had been steadily pushing westward in its seemingly unstoppable advance. The Mongols had a deserved reputation for ruthlessness, giving new territories one opportunity to surrender, and if there was resistance, the Mongols moved in and slaughtered the local population.

In 1243, Sempad was part of the embassy to [[Caesarea in Cappadocia|Caesarea]], where he negotiated with the Mongol leader [[Baiju]]. In 1246 and again in 1259, Sempad was in charge of organizing the defense of Cilicia against the invasion of the [[Sultanate of Rum]]. In 1247, when King Hetoum I decided that his wisest course of action was to peacefully submit to the Mongols, Sempad was sent to the Mongol court in [[Karakorum]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; There, Sempad met [[Kublai Khan]]'s brother [[Möngke Khan]], and made an alliance between Cilicia and the Mongols, against their common enemy the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Bournotian, p. 100. "Smbat met Kubali's brother, Mongke Khan and in 1247, made an alliance against the Muslims."&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this relationship is described differently by various historians, some of whom refer to it as an alliance, while others describe it as a submission to Mongol overlordship, making Armenia a vassal state.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherford, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Angus Donal Stewart, in ''Logic of Conquest'', described it as, "The Armenian king saw alliance with the Mongols &amp;ndash; or, more accurately, swift and peaceful subjection to them &amp;ndash; as the best course of action."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, ''Logic of Conquest'', p. 8. "The Armenian king saw alliance with the Mongols - or, more accurately, swift and peaceful subjection to them -- as the best course of action."&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian military leaders were required to serve in the Mongol army, and many of them perished in Mongol battles.&lt;ref&gt;Bournotian, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 1247-1250&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; visit to the Mongol court, Sempad received a relative of the Great Khan as a bride. He had a son with her, named Vasil Tatar,&lt;ref&gt;Luisetto, p.122, who references introduction and notes in [[Gérard Dédéyan]] ''La Chronique attribuée au Connétable Sempad'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; who would later be captured by the Mamluks at the [[Battle of Mari]] in 1266.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Sempad returned to Cilicia in 1250, though he returned to Mongolia in 1254, accompanying King Hetoum on his own visit to the court of the Great Khan, [[Möngke]].

On the death of his father, Sempad became Baron of ''Papeŕōn'' ([[Çandır Castle]]) and resided in its small, but lavish baronial palace.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p.102-110; pls.53a-56b, 292b-295a&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sempad died in 1276 either in the Second Battle of [[Sarvandikar]], fighting against the Mamluks of Egypt, or against an invasion of the [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]] from [[Marash]]. The Armenians won the battle, but Sempad and several other barons were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Mutafian, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judge==
Sempad was a member of the Armenian supreme court, the ''Verin'' or ''Mec Darpas'', which examined government policies and the legal codes. He created a translation of the ''[[Assizes]] of Antioch'' (a legal code) from French, and also created in [[Middle Armenian]] a ''Datastanagirk''' (codex), which was based on and adapted from the earlier work of [[Mkhitar Gosh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer==
Sempad is best known for providing eyewitness written accounts of his era. He wrote the "''Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie''" (''History of the Kingdom of Little Armenia'') which begins around 951/952, and ends in 1274, two years before his death.  He worked from older Armenian, Syriac, Christian, and possibly Byzantine sources, as well as from his own observations. Sempad's writings are considered a valuable resource by historians, although some have criticized them as unreliable, as Sempad was often writing for reasons of propaganda rather than history.&lt;ref&gt;Little, ''An Introduction to Mamluk Historiography''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angus Donal Stewart, ''Armenian Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple translations exist of the work, in varying levels of completeness.  According to historian Angus Donal Stewart, there are both French and English translations, which cover the period up until the 1270s.&lt;ref name=stewart-22&gt;Stewart, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, it was translated by Eduard Dulaurier and published in ''[[Receuil des Historiens des Croisades]]'', ''Historiens Armeniens I'', together with some other continuation excerpts by an anonymous author which cover the period after Sempad's death, up through the 1330s. This edition also includes excerpts from the work of [[Nerses Balients]], who was writing in the later fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=stewart-22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-51557&amp;M=imageseule ''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Historiens Arméniens I, Chronique du Royaume de Petite Arménie''], p. 610 et seq. &lt;/ref&gt;

Sempad was enthusiastic about his travel to the Mongol realm, which lasted between 1247 and 1250.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p.529, Note 273&lt;/ref&gt; He sent letters to Western rulers of Cyprus and the [[Principality of Antioch]], describing a Central Asian realm of oasis with many Christians, generally of the Nestorian rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Richard. ''Histoire des Croisades'', p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 1248, Sempad sent a letter from [[Samarkand]] to his brother-in-law [[Henry I of Cyprus|Henry I, king of Cyprus]] (who was married to Sempad's sister Stephanie (''Etienette''):&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p. 529, note 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christians of the Orient went to the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Tartars who now rules (Güyük), and he received them with great honour and gave them freedom and let it know everywhere that no-one should dare antagonize them, be it in deeds or in words."|Letter from Sempad to Henry I.&lt;ref&gt;Extract quoted in Grousset, p. 529&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Sempad's letters was read by [[Louis IX of France]] during his 1248 stay in Cyprus, which encouraged him to send ambassadors to the Mongols, in the person of the Dominican [[André de Longjumeau]], who went to visit [[Güyük Khan]].

The '''storage of cultural heritage objects''' typically falls to the responsibility of cultural heritage institutions, or individuals. The proper storage of these objects can help to ensure a longer lifespan for the object with minimal damage or degradation. With so many different types of artifacts, materials, and combinations of materials, keepers of these artifacts often have considerable knowledge of the best practices in storing these objects to preserve their original state.

== Storage spaces ==
[[File:Shelves of military equipment at the Treloar Technology Centre in September 2012.JPG|thumb|Items being stored on shelves and the floor at the Australian War Memorial's [[Treloar Resource Centre]]]]
The process involved when creating a collections storage area usually involves determining the available resources, the needs of the specific collection, how the collection will be used, and the necessary space required based on the current collection and potential future acquisitions.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000423/042316eo.pdf |title=Protection of the cultural heritage: Museum collection storage |last1=Johnson |first1=E.Verner |last2=Horgan |first2=Joanne C. |publisher=United Nations, Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organizations |date=1979 |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of objects in storage, as well as the need to retrieve them, will have an effect on the type of storage space desired. If only a small portion of the collection is regularly utilized, then a separate more easily accessible storage space may be chosen for these objects, while less utilized objects may be held in a less accessible area of the building, or an offsite facility.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;  In either case, collections storage spaces are typically separate from all other activity in order to decrease the potential for damage to the collection from theft, tracked in soil, excessive light exposure, etc.&lt;ref name=NPS2012&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 7: Museum Collection Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well designed collections storage space is multi-layered, beginning with the building itself, a room, storage furniture, and packaging.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; The more layers utilized the greater the protection from agents of deterioration.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; It is generally agreed that storage spaces should not be at the top of the building or below grade, but attics and basements are often the most practical space for storage, so many institutions weigh the risks, and opt to upgrade these spaces in terms of structure, insulation, and/or vapor barriers to create a suitable space for storage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Lynn |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=293–299 |chapter=5H: Storage |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and size of the objects in the collection also help to determine where and how the storage space is set up. If the collection has many large heavy items, like furniture, the storage spaces typically have low shelving for these items, and require wide isles to move the objects, especially if they require large equipment like a forklift to be moved.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In these cases, the doorways must be large enough to accommodate these large objects, and the floor structure must be reinforced to hold the weight of the collection.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; If a collection consists of mostly small objects, then cabinets and shelving are a practical solution, while a collection of two-dimensional works might require flat drawers and hanging racks.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Environmental control ==
The climate control systems in collections storage typically include the control of temperature, [[relative humidity]], and a ventilation and filtration system to remove atmospheric pollutants like dust, chemicals, and micro-organisms.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; The basic idea of climate control is to keep the temperature and relative humidity at a steady rate so as to avoid expansion and contraction of materials, which can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=MPH5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-5.pdf |title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 5: Agents of Deterioration|publisher=Department of the Interior |format=PDF |access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate control is typically achieved by utilizing an [[HVAC]] system, though depending on weather patterns, these systems can often require a great deal of energy to run, which is a concern for many institutions.&lt;ref name=WAAC&gt;{{cite web|title=A Discussion of Research on the Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity on Museum Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-3/wn18-307.html|website=WAAC Newsletter|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Generally, keeping a lower temperature is better for collections storage, because chemical and biological reactions tend to increase as the temperature increases and structural damage is possible to objects made of materials such as wax, at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The standard practice for temperature control for general collections objects is a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°F +/-2&amp;nbsp;°F, or 21&amp;nbsp;°C +/-2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Genevieve |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Rebecca A. |editor2-last=Gilmore |editor2-first=Jean A. |title=MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Ed. |publisher=The AAM Press |date=2010 |pages=287–292 |chapter=5G: Preventive Care |isbn=9781933253152}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some collections, there are specified temperature suggestions to protect delicate materials. For example, furs, paper archives, and textiles may be stored at a lower temperature between 41&amp;nbsp;°F to 50&amp;nbsp;°F (5-10&amp;nbsp;°C), and cellulose nitrate film is often isolated and stored below freezing, as it has the potential to ignite at 106&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

===Relative humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumb|Hygrothermograph]]
The standard practice for humidity control for collections objects is a relative humidity of 50% +/-5%, though the expenditures required to keep such a tight relative humidity have been shown to only offer modest prevention benefits.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; As with temperature control, the main goal of the control of relative humidity to is avoid major fluctuations which can cause physical damage to objects, with long term seasonal changes causing greater damage than short term changes.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; [[Hygroscopy|Hygroscopic]] materials such as wood, textiles, and bone, are especially sensitive to changes in humidity, as they swell and shrink according to the environment, which will cause deterioration over time.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Mold growth occurs only when the relative humidity is about 70% or higher, and insect infestation is more common with a high relative humidity.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; A very low relative humidity, of about 35% or lower, can cause embrittlement of paper and adhesives, as well as cracking and warping of wood and ivory.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Many museum objects are constructed of multiple materials, so in order to provide an appropriate relative humidity for the object as a whole, certain materials may be compromised.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

=== Monitoring Climate ===
An ongoing monitoring system is essential to the preventive care of objects in collections storage, as it helps to identify any problems, evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures, and document the effect of extraordinary events such as water leaks, long periods of drought, or heavy rains.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; Hygrothermographs are a tool that constantly monitors both the temperature and relative humidity, and are fairly reliable if properly calibrated, a task that must be completed at least every three months if not more frequently.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; The value with these devices is that they constantly record the data onto graphs that can be analyzed at a later time. [[Hygrometer]]s, thermometers, and thermohygrometers are also useful for determining the temperature and relative humidity of a space, but the most reliable tool is a psychrometer.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt; [[Data logger]]s are becoming more popular in institutions as they are small, record data at desired intervals, and allow the data to be easily transferred to a computer in multiple formats including graphs and tables, which allows for easy collection and assessment of the data.&lt;ref name=MPH5 /&gt;

== Lighting ==
Because damage from visible light and ultraviolet radiation is cumulative and irreversible, collections storage spaces tend to have few ambient light sources, such as windows, and often have lighting installed in multiple zones controlled by different switches, so that all of the lights do not have to be turned on when only a small area of the storage space is actively being used.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt; LED or UV-filtered fluorescent bulbs are generally recommended, as they save energy compared to incandescent bulbs, while quartz and halogen bulbs emit high levels of UV and infrared radiation as well as a significant amount of heat, which can cause increased deterioration of objects in the space.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

== Integrated pest management ==
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated pest management (IPM)]] is an intensive program that monitors for pests, such as insects and rodents, which may harm collections. This method utilizes traps to monitor the types of pests entering storage spaces, and to eliminate pest entrances and attractors.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Chemical treatments for pests are generally only utilized as a last resort, and with the advice of a professional, because they add toxic and potentially harmful chemicals to the storage space.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; To avoid attracting pests, collecting institutions typically avoid having exterior lighting focused around doors and windows, when possible, and also avoid using mercury vapor or tungsten lights.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

== Storage furniture ==
[[File:MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966.jpg|thumb|MN Warsaw. Interior painting store. 1966]]
They type of objects in the collection, available space, and need for ease of accessibility tend to determine what type of storage system is utilized for a particular collection.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; There are many generic storage systems that can be purchased and modified to fit the needs of a specific collection, and this is generally more cost effective than having a system specially built.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; In small storage areas many institutions will utilize mobile systems that have shelving units on a track, which allows access to a desired aisle while the rest of the shelving units are pushed together.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

Wood storage furniture is typically avoided, even if painted, as it offgasses harmful acids, while often used metal storage equipment is typically made out of steel that is powder-coated with an epoxy finish, which is more durable than an acrylic or polyester finish.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Storage racks ===
Sliding racks are typically used for the storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a wire rack connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized to make the most of the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Shelving and cabinets ===
[[File:Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10.jpg|thumb|Backstage Pass at the British Museum 10]]
Open steel shelving systems are cost effective, and easily adjusted to accommodate objects of various sizes.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Deeper shelves are often utilized for larger objects, while smaller objects are typically stored on narrower shelves to avoid overcrowding, and potential damage when retrieving objects from the back of the shelf.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Shelving units can accommodate the height of the ceiling if necessary, but it is safer for objects and those working with them to keep shelves within an easily accessible reach.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; If open shelving is used, it is suggested that the objects are placed in boxes, or otherwise covered to protect the objects from dust and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Metal shelving is prone to carry vibrations, so if objects are not individually housed in boxes or otherwise stabilized, it is recommended that the shelves be lined with a protective padding.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; It is also necessary for cabinets to be stabilized by being bolted to the floor or walls, and for shelves to have restraining bars, to avoid tipping, especially in earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

Cabinets tend to be versatile and easily accommodate a wide variety of objects with adjustable shelving and drawers, and have the ability to close the objects off to avoid damage from dust and light even if the objects are not in boxes or otherwise covered.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

=== Drawers ===
Drawers can be open or closed, and contained within cabinets or stand as a unit of their own. Open drawer systems leave room between drawers and are often adjustable to accommodate objects of different heights by placing the drawers in the desired runners or leaving unused drawers out completely.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Closed drawer systems offer more protection from dust and light exposure than the open drawer systems, and the drawers are typically shorter to accommodate small objects, textiles, and two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Dividers can be made to fit in shallow drawers to create individual compartments for small objects like coins, or small individual boxes can be utilized in the same fashion, which allows the entire box to be removed so the object itself is handled less.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;
[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 2.JPG|thumb|An archival tube role for a Chinese scroll.]]

=== Textile rolls ===
Rolls are a preferred way to store certain textiles because they help to avoid creasing or stretching. The method typically involves rolling textiles around a cardboard tube that has been covered with acid-free paper, or some other barrier, and then a plastic cover is wrapped around the rolled textile, with the ends loosely tied, to protect from dust.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Rolled textiles can be placed on a shelf, but a preferred method is to suspend them horizontally by the ends of the tubes, which keeps the textiles from being damaged by pressure.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

== Archival housing materials ==
Archival housing materials are utilized to protect objects from dust, light, and vibrations that could potentially harm objects in the storage space, if they were not otherwise protected.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Commonly used office supplies do not typically have archival qualities, and to ensure that collections objects are not affected by these materials, institutions do not use materials that have not been tested, to ensure they are inert and therefore will not place the collections at risk.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival boxes ===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumb|Archival boxes on open shelves.]]
Boxes can add an additional layer of microclimate insulation and make moving objects easier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival boxes are typically made of corrugated, acid-free paper, either buffered or unbuffered, or they can be made of corrugated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

=== Archival papers ===
All paper products will acidify over time, so even archival [[acid-free paper]] products used for storage are typically replaced every few years.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Archival acid-free paper products can be either buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered paper has a neutral pH and is used for housing photographs, textiles, and most other types of objects, while buffered paper, which is impregnated with calcium carbonate and has an alkaline pH, is used for storing paper objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; The buffered paper absorbs the acid that paper objects emit and keeps the micro-environment from becoming overly acidic for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Acid-free [[Glassine|glassine paper]] is typically used to cover [[friability|friable]] materials or objects with oily/tacky surfaces, as it is smooth and does not create static electricity, though it is only used for short periods of time because it deteriorates quickly.&lt;ref name=NPS1999&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Handbook: Part I, Museums Collections |publisher=Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=1999 |chapter=Chapter 6: Handling, Packing, and Shipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Soft unbuffered acid-free tissue paper is used for covering a variety of objects, creating padding in boxes, and for placing in the folds of textiles to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Acid-free folders are valuable for storing unframed prints and documents in flat files.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
[[File:Ceramic ring housed in blue board box.JPG|thumb|Ceramic ring housed in archival box with Ethafoam pad and plastic covered viewing window.]]

=== Archival plastics ===
Most common plastics contain chlorinated compounds and plasticizers, which can migrate out and harm objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; Polyethylene and polyester are considered archival plastics because they do not offgas harmful chemicals, but they can produce static electricity in a low RH, so they should be avoided around friable objects.&lt;ref name=NPS2012 /&gt;

*Polyester film, or [[BoPET|Mylar]], is a good tool for paper preservation and can act as a vapor barrier.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*[[Tyvek]] is a textile-like material created from high-density polyethylene, and works as an alternative to glassine paper, but its fabric-like quality also allows it to be draped over objects and utilized in numerous ways where paper products are not ideal.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polypropylene or polyethylene bags come in a multitude of sizes, with or without zip closures, and are often utilized for small objects, but may trap moisture and cause molding if sealed closed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;&lt;ref name=MPH8&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/policy/upload/mphi-8.pdf|title=Museum Property Handbook Volume I: Preservation and Protection of Museum Property: Chapter 8: Handling, Packing, and Shipping |publisher=Department of the Interior|format=PDF|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admiral Sir Robert Waller Otway (1770-1846) RMG RP6256.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Painting in storage at the [[Royal Museums Greenwich]], tagged with an identification number.]]

=== Archival fabrics ===
Fabrics are utilized for wrapping or padding objects, or in the form of string to secure wrappings or labels onto objects. Archival fabrics are typically washed before use to remove sizing chemicals and to soften the material, and are never dyed.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Cotton fabrics are often used, typically in the form of twill tape and  threads, which allow for an easy way to secure wrappings, secure objects within containers, and to tie tags to objects with registration information.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;
*Unbleached muslin is often used to wrap sculptures and textiles.&lt;ref name=NPS1999 /&gt;
*Polyester batting is often utilized for padding objects, especially textiles, which often require padding between folds to prevent creasing.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

=== Archival foams ===
Foam rubber and urethane foams offgas harmful fumes, and are highly flammable, so they are typically avoided in collection storage spaces.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

*Polyethylene microfoam, commonly called Ethafoam, is an inert foam that is useful for lining drawers and shelves, padding or cradling objects, or for mounting objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt; It is commercially available in numerous sizes and can easily be cut and shaped to fit the users needs.

== Open Storage ==
[[File:Visual storage at V&amp;A - 1 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|250px|Visual storage at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]]]
Many museums are beginning to opt for [[Visible storage|open storage]] spaces that allow visitors to see more of the collections and behind the scenes activities. While this practice has become popular for the enjoyment of visitors and the transparency of institutions, the practice allows for increased light exposure, dust levels, and other environmental concerns that could be potentially harmful to the objects.&lt;ref name=Swain /&gt;

'''''Targeted Killing in International Law''''' is a book about the legality of [[targeted killing]], written by [[Nils Melzer]]. It was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in May 2008. The book explores the history of targeted killing as a government strategy by multiple countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany; for both military and law enforcement purposes. Melzer argues that directly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.

Melzer holds a PhD degree in law from [[University of Zürich]]. His dissertation dealt with targeted killing and the book updates and revises that work. He had earlier written on the subject for ''Yearbook of Humanitarian International Law'' in 2006. Melzer serves as a legal advisor for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC).

==Content summary==
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|right|A [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]]  [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; used in targeted killings]]
Nils Melzer presents an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt; The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew more supportive of targeted killing than ever before.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt; The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt; He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force.&lt;ref name="solis"&gt;{{citation|first=Gary D. |last=Solis|title=The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War|pages=538–539|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-87088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melzer analyzes all areas of the topic.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

The book discusses related legal practices of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel was the first country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the [[Israeli Supreme Court]], where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather with the nature of the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt;

Melzer claims that during the [[Vietnam War]] the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] used targeted killings as part of the [[Phoenix Program]], attempting to  eliminate [[Vietcong]] sympathizers. Melzer cites a source who contends that some 40,000 individuals may have been killed under this program. The author sees the air raids on [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|1986 bombing of Libya]] in response to the [[Lockerbie bombing]] as another instance. He argues that after September 11, 2001, the policy became more acceptable in the U.S. to adopt targeted killings as a tactic.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt;

According to Melzer, after the September 11 attacks, U.S. strategists began to support targeted killings and accepted advice from Israel on how to use such tactics to deal with [[suicide bomber]]s. Melzer describes an abrupt change where military members were ordered to "shoot to kill", replacing prior orders to incapacitate. The author asserts that in at least one case in 2005, a person was killed because they were thought to be a terrorist holding a bomb. It was later revealed that this person suffered from [[mental illness]] and may have had a medical history of [[bipolar disorder]]. The shooting was determined to be justifiable under the law and criminal charges were not filed.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt;

Melzer discusses the shift in perceptions towards acceptance by United Kingdom law enforcement after September 11. The Metropolitan Police officially endorsed a "shoot to kill" strategy directly after the attack. Melzer finds this policy shift incongruous, due to the fact that targeted killing had never before been acceptable as police strategy. Prior to the attack, targeted killing was a criminal offense.&lt;ref name="worley" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Targeted Killing in International Law'' was a joint-winner of the 2009 Paul Guggenheim Prize in International Law given by the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|Geneva Graduate Institute]].&lt;ref name="oup" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Winner of the 2009 Paul Guggenheim Prize (Geneva Graduate Institute)|author=[[Oxford University Press, USA]]|work=OUP USA Home|publisher=www.oup.com|year=2010|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199577903|accessdate=10 April 2016|archivedate=29 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173347/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199577903}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter "Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law" authored by [[Kenneth Anderson (jurist)|Kenneth Anderson]] as a contributor to the book ''Legislating the War on Terror: An Agenda for Reform'', he characterizes Melzer's book as an admirable opus on the subject.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{citation|pages=360, 366, 394–395|editor1-first=Benjamin |editor1-last=Wittes|title=Legislating the War on Terror: An Agenda for Reform|publisher=[[Brookings Institution Press]] |year=2009|isbn=0-8157-0310-4|chapter=Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Anderson (jurist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson describes the book in more depth in a footnote, calling it a complete and thorough academic reference book.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; He goes on to criticize the perspective of the book for describing and then rejecting objections by the United States to arguments addressed in the work.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; Anderson writes that the book is both one scholars must have to educate themselves on the subject, while simultaneously lamenting its advocacy for U.S. legal positions.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt; Anderson observes the author covers all facets of targeted killing in the book.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

In a review of the book for the journal ''International Criminal Justice Review'', Robert M. Worley of [[Penn State Altoona]] comments favorably on the comprehensive nature of Melzer's research and his descriptions of the differences of the practice of targeted killing in varying countries.&lt;ref name="worley"&gt;{{citation|title=Targeted Killing in International Law|journal=International Criminal Justice Review|location=United States|last=Worley|first=Robert M.

A review of the book in the ''Leiden Journal of International Law'' by Tamás Hoffmann recommends the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students.&lt;ref name="hoffmann"&gt;{{citation|title=Targeted Killing in International Law|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|volume=22|issue=4|date=December 2009|pages=867–873|location=Great Britain|issn=0922-1565|last=Hoffmann|first=Tamás|doi=10.1017/s0922156509990276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; The review places the book within the context of addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution on the question of the practice's legality.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the ''Australian Year Book of International Law''.&lt;ref name="durhan"&gt;{{citation|last=Durhan|first=Helen|title=Targeted Killing in International Law|pages=276–277|journal=Australian Year Book of International Law|year=2008|issn=0084-7658|location=Australia|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality.&lt;ref name="durhan" /&gt; She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people.&lt;ref name="durhan" /&gt; Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner.&lt;ref name="durhan" /&gt; The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.&lt;ref name="durhan" /&gt;

Writing in a review for the ''[[American Journal of International Law]]'', Michael N. Schmitt observes that the arguments put forth in the book by Melzer are indeed accurate.&lt;ref name="schmitt" /&gt; Schmitt writes that Melzer correctly argues that in the police model sequential events within the legal system lead to [[precedent]] for engaging in targeted killing.&lt;ref name="schmitt"&gt;{{citation|title=Targeted Killing in International Law|last=Schmitt|first=Michael N.|journal=[[American Journal of International Law]]|volume=103|issue=4|date=October 2009|pages=813–818|location=United States|issn=0002-9300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt describes the book as an excellent overview of many aspects of law regarding targeted killing.&lt;ref name="schmitt" /&gt; Schmitt concludes, "''Targeted Killing in International Law'' is not just a major contribution to the legal literature, it has justifiably emerged as the premier work on the subject."&lt;ref name="schmitt" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Truth about Nanjing'''''|南京の真実|Nankin no shinjitsu}} is a 2007 film by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[uyoku dantai|nationalist]] filmmaker [[Satoru Mizushima]]&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite news|title=Japanese filmmaker to deny Nanjing massacre|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/26/2003346406|newspaper=[[Taipei Times]]|date=January 26, 2007|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the 1937 [[Nanking Massacre]].

The film was backed by [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] figures including Tokyo governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] and public donations,&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/26/AR2007112600477.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was intended to expose what the filmmakers saw as propaganda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070125a3.html|title=Filmmaker to paint Nanjing slaughter as just myth|last=Hongo|first=Jun|date=January 25, 2007|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813134221/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070125a3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; aspects of the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Less than a month before the 70th anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, the director said in an interview&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; that Japanese [[war criminal]]s were [[martyr]]s who were made into scapegoats for [[war crime]]s as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross in order to bear the [[sin]]s of the world, and they died bearing all of old Japan's good and bad parts. He also claimed that the Nanjing Massacre was a politically motivated frame-up by China and the numerous Western eyewitnesses, whose accounts form the basis of the historical understanding of the Nanjing Massacre. These accounts were, according to the filmmakers, [[espionage]] activities.

Mizushima said that the project was meant to counter the film ''[[Nanking (2007 film)|Nanking]]'', a 2007 American [[Documentary film|documentary]], which he believed was "based on fabrications and gives a false impression"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/docs-offer-rival-visions-of-nanking-2-1117958065/|title=Docs offer rival visions of Nanking |last=Schilling |first=Mark |date=January 24, 2007 |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he perceives to be a "setup by China to control intelligence".

'''The road to hell is paved with good intentions''' is a [[proverb]] or [[aphorism]]. An alternative form is "'''Hell is full of good meanings, but heaven is full of good works'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Proverbs |page=234 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9780816066735 |chapter=the road to Hell is paved with good intentions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The saying is thought to have originated with [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]] who wrote ({{circa}} 1150), "''L'enfer est plein de bonnes volontés ou désirs''" (hell is full of good wishes or desires).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA542 |title=The American Heritage dictionary of idioms |first1=Christine |last1=Ammer |isbn=9780395727744 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier saying occurs in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': "''facilis descensus Averno'' (the descent to hell is easy)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Analogous Proverbs In Ten Languages |chapter=Hell is paved with good intentions |first1=Mrs E. B. |last1=Mawr |year=1885 |publisher=Elliot Stock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
A common interpretation of the saying is that wrongdoings or evil actions are often masked by good intentions; or even that good intentions, when acted upon, may have [[unintended consequences]]. A simple example is the introduction of an [[invasive species]], like the [[Asian carp]], which has become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/psychological-solution-bullying/201008/principle-number-one-the-road-hell-is-paved-good-intenti |journal=Psychology Today |series=Resilience to Bullying |first1=Izzy |last1=Kalman |title=Principle Number One: The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |date=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning of the phrase is that individuals may have the intention to undertake good actions but nevertheless fail to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/the+road+to+hell+is+paved+with+good+intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.com/[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |work=The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |edition=Third  |year=2005 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org/[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus |edition=Third |year=2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inaction may be due to [[procrastination]], [[laziness]] or other subversive vice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGiREb_p238C&amp;pg=PA33 |title=101 American English proverbs: understanding language and culture through commonly used sayings |first1=Harry |last1=Collis |first2=Mario |last2=Risso |chapter=The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |isbn=9780844254128 |year=1992 |location=Lincolnwood, Ill |publisher=Passport Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the saying is an admonishment that a good intention is meaningless unless followed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychosocial Basis of Health Care |first1=Charles L., editor |last1=Bowden |first2=Alvin George, editor |last2=Burstein |page=98 |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=1983 |isbn=0-683-00993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty can be used to justify the harm done by failing policies and actions. Those with good intentions believe their practices are good for the group; it is self-evident to them. They justify [[collateral damage]] in the belief they do a greater good. The [[Nazi concentration camps]] were created to hold so-called "racially undesirable elements" of German society. The [[GULAG]] system was introduced in order to isolate disloyal elements not contributing to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The [[Inquisition]] was established to eradicate [[heretics]] in religious states. The harm done is clearly seen, and acknowledged, but is written off as a 'price worth paying'.

On a personal level, taking a subjectively "good action" can land one in a horrific emotional and/or physical state of being, e.g., a soldier goes off to war to fight for the subjective good of their country and ends up with  [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

==Studies==
[[Psychology|Psychological]] studies of the effect of intention upon task completion by professors [[Peter Gollwitzer]], Paschal Sheeran and Sheina Orbell indicate that there is some truth in the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=38 |first1=Peter |last1=Gollwitzer |first2=Paschal |last2=Sheeran |chapter=Implementation intentions and goal achievement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Qhwr7jGyFsC&amp;pg=PA70 |isbn=9780120152384 |date=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]] are especially prone to having their [[Implementation intention|intention]]s backfire in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=31 |pages=902&amp;ndash;912 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0146167204272311 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/7/902 |issue=7 |last1=Powers |first1=T. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/30/3/328.abstract |title=Actions, Intentions, and Self-Assessment: The Road to Self-Enhancement Is Paved with Good Intentions |first1=Justin |last1=Kruger |first2=Thomas |last2=Gilovich |doi=10.1177/0146167203259932 |year=2004 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=328–339 |pmid=15030624}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that people are more likely to interpret their own actions as more well intended than the actions of others.

Attempts to improve the [[ethics|ethical]] behaviour of groups are often counter-productive.  If legislation is used for such an attempt, people observe the [[letter of the law]] rather than improve the desired behaviour.  During [[negotiation]], groups that are encouraged to understand the [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] of the other parties are worse at this than those whose [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] is not enlightened.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  The threat of [[punishment]] may make behavior less rather than more ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEu7eyQEZPcC&amp;pg=PA273 |title=Ethics in groups |volume=8 |chapter=The Road to Hell |first1=David |last1=Messick |pages=273–274 |isbn=9780762313006 |date=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of [[business ethics]] indicate that most wrongdoing is not due directly to wickedness but is performed by people who did not plan to err.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9wdAJWyG4C&amp;pg=PA11 |title=Good intentions aside: a manager's guide to resolving ethical problems |first1=Laura L. |last1=Nash |isbn=9780875844299 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen G. Post|Stephen Garrard Post]], writing about [[altruism]], suggests that good intentions are often not what they seem and that mankind normally acts from less worthy, selfish motives&amp;mdash;"If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, it is partly because that is the road they generally start out on."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Altruism &amp; altruistic love |first1=Stephen Garrard |last1=Post |page=203 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780195143584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Timberlake &amp; Timbaland) – 4 Minutes|url=https://genius.com/Madonna-4-minutes-lyrics|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[In the Pale Moonlight]]".

Saint '''Theophanes the Confessor''' ({{lang-el|Θεοφάνης Ὁμολογητής}}; c. 758/760 – March 12, 817/818) was a member of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] aristocracy, who became a [[monk]] and [[chronicle]]r. He is venerated on March 12 in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Biography==
Theophanes was born in [[Constantinople]] of wealthy and noble [[iconodule]] parents: Isaac, imperial governor of the islands of the Black Sea, and Theodora, of whose family nothing is known.{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}  His father died when Theophanes was three years old, and the [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine V]] (740–775) subsequently saw to the boy's education and upbringing at the imperial court. Theophanes would hold several offices under this patron.

He was married at the age of twelve, but convinced his wife to lead a life of virginity. In 799, after the death of his father-in-law, they separated with mutual consent to embrace the religious life. She chose a convent on an island near Constantinople, while he entered the Polychronius Monastery, located in the district of Sigiane (Sigriano), near [[Cyzicus]] on the Asian side of the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Later, he built a monastery on his own lands on the island of [[Calonymus]] (now Calomio).{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}

After six years he returned to Sigriano, where he founded an abbey known by the name "of the great acre" and governed it as [[abbot]]. In this position of leadership, he was present at the [[Second General Council of Nicaea]] in 787, and signed its decrees in defense of the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s.{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}

When Emperor [[Leo V the Armenian]] (813–820) resumed his [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] warfare, he ordered Theophanes brought to Constantinople. The Emperor tried in vain to induce him to condemn the same veneration of icons that had been sanctioned by the council. Theophanes was cast into prison and for two years suffered cruel treatment. After his release, he was banished to [[Samothrace]] in 817, where overwhelmed with afflictions, he lived only seventeen days. He is credited with many miracles that occurred after his death,{{sfn|Mershman|1912}} which most likely took place on 12 March, the day he is commemorated in the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]''.{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}

==''Chronicle''==
At the urgent request of his friend [[George Syncellus]], Theophanes undertook the continuation of Syncellus' ''Chronicle'' ({{lang|grc|Χρονογραφία}}, Kronografia), during the years 810 to 815.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mershman|1912}} citing P.G., CVIII, 55&lt;/ref&gt; The language used occupies a place midway between the stiff ecclesiastical and the vernacular Greek.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}He arguably made use of three main sources: first, material already prepared by Syncellus; second, he probably made the use of a set of extracts made by [[Theodore Lector]] from the works of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], [[Sozomenus]], and [[Theodoret]]; and third, the city chronicle of Constantinople.{{sfn|Mershman|1912}} Cyril Mango has argued that Theophanes contributed but little to the chronicle that bears his name, and that the vast bulk of its contents are the work of Syncellus; on this model, Theophanes' main contribution was to cast Syncellus' rough materials together in a unified form.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Theophanes' part of the chronicle covered events from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284 (which is the point where the chronicle of [[George Syncellus]] ends) to the downfall of [[Michael I Rhangabes]] in 813. This part of the chronicle is valuable for having preserved the accounts of lost authorities on Byzantine history for the seventh and eighth centuries that would be otherwise have been lost. 

The work consists of two parts, wherein the first provides a chronological history arranged per annum, and the second contains chronological tables that are regretably full of inaccuracies. It seems that Theophanes had only prepared the tables, leaving vacant spaces for the proper dates, but that these had been filled out by someone else ([[Hugo von Hurter]], ''Nomenlator literarius recentioris'' I, Innsbruck, 1903, 735). In the chronological first part, in addition to reckoning by the years of the world and the Christian era, Theophanes introduces in tabular form the regnal years of the Roman emperors, of the Persian kings and Arab caliphs, and of the five oecumenical patriarchs, a system which leads to considerable confusion,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and therefore of little value.

The first part, though lacking in critical insight and chronological accuracy, which could scarcely be expected from a man of such ascetical disposition {{clarify|date=May 2018}} greatly surpasses the majority of Byzantine chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mershman|1912}} citing {{harvnb|Krumbacher|1897|p=342}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theophanes's Chronicle is particularly valuable beginning with the reign of [[Justin II]] (565), srthe point in his work he drew upon sources that have not survived his times&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mershman|1912}} citing [[Traianus Patricius]], [[Theophilus of Edessa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophanes' ''Chronicle'' was much used by succeeding chroniclers, and in 873–875 a [[Latin]] compilation  was made&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mershman|1912}} notes that it was published in vol. ii. of De Boor's edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[Pope|papal]] librarian [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius|Anastasius]] from the chronicles of [[Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], George Syncellus, and Theophanes for the use of a deacon named Johannes in the second half of the ninth century, and thus was known to Western Europe.{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}

There also survives a further continuation, in six books, of the ''Chronicle'' down to the year 961 written by a number of mostly anonymous writers (called [[Theophanes Continuatus]] or ''Scriptores post Theophanem''), who undertook the work at the instructions of [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]].{{sfn|Mershman|1912}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">The '''Transgender Oral History Project''' is an initiative by and for the transgender community. TOHP collects interviews and produces multimedia content featuring a stories of [[transgender]]-identified people, and exists to empower trans folks through sharing stories of their lives. The Transgender Oral History Project is also active in the community, hosting events in many states including [[Massachusetts]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], Seattle, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]].

==Goals==
According to the official website, the Transgender Oral History Project's goals are to build community, encourage inter-generational discussion, framing contemporary issues that transgender people faced within a broader context, highlight individuals, communities, and organizations struggling with trans issues that are not addressed by mainstream discourses and portray how political, social, and historical circumstances impact transgender lives.

== Founding ==
The Trans Oral History project was founded in 2009 by André Pérez as began documenting the evolution of the first ever New England Transgender Pride March. He went on to create a multimedia exhibit entitled, "Community in Transition: 40 Years of Struggle" that incorporated archival materials from the Sexual Minorities Archives and the first set of interviews from the Transgender Oral History Project. This exhibit has been featured at Marlboro College, University of Illinois Chicago, and the Translating Identities Conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvm.edu/~tic/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Past Projects ==
In 2010, a poster describing the Compton's Cafeteria riot was featured in the anthology, [http://www.justseeds.org/josh_macphee/04cphbook.html Celebrate People's History], published by the Just Seeds Collective.

In 2011, the Trans Oral History Project participated in a two-month residency at the University of Illinois, Chicago's LGBTQ Resource Center. TOHP collective members lead a participatory workshop series and created a multimedia exhibition featuring interview materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagofilmmakers.org/cf/content/cdmpf-2013-finalists?page=2 |title=Chicago Filmmakers Digital Media Production Fund Finalists |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140720132141/http://transoralhistory.com/ilive/curriculum I Live for Trans Education: A Youth Toolkit] officially launched. I Live featured mini documentaries paired with interactive activities to teach about issues that impact the transgender community. The toolkit is a resource for trans educators, youth workers, and youth leaders to educate about issues that impact the trans community from an intersectional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-19/news/ct-met-trans-101-profiles-20111219_1_gender-identity-gender-variance-transgender |title=Finding Their Gender Identities |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOHP also began partnering with [[StoryCorps]], the largest oral history project in North America, to record and preserve stories. A TOHP interview was featured on WBEZ in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/series/storycorps/transgender-man-learns-accept-love-110424 |title=Transgender Man Learns to Accept Love |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trans Oral History Project now serves as a community archive for StoryCorps' recordings with transgender individuals, and is in the process of integrating those interviews into their publicly accessible digital archive of transgender stories.

== Community Events==

Members of the Trans History Collective have also led educational workshops in community settings, academic institutions, and national conferences. The Transgender Oral History Project collaborates with other organizations in the area to host regular skills shares that teach media production skills to trans* and gender variant people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5228">{{short description|Australian journalist}}
'''Ulrich Ruegg Ellis''' (23 July 1904 – 4 December 1981) was an Australian journalist, political activist, and historian. He was known for his work in developing [[Canberra]], his involvement with the [[Proposals for new Australian States|New State Movement]], and his behind-the-scenes work with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]]. He was the younger brother of the writer [[Malcolm Henry Ellis]].

==Early life==
Ellis was born in [[Mount Morgan, Queensland]], the youngest child of Constance Jane (née Ruegg) and Thomas James Ellis. His father was an Irish-born miner and his mother was born in England. He was raised solely by his mother from the age of three, when she and the children moved to the [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Tingalpa, Queensland|Tingalpa]]. Ellis attended the local state school in [[Kelvin Grove, Queensland|Kelvin Grove]] before going on to [[Brisbane Grammar School]]. He became a cadet journalist at the age of 16.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ellis-ulrich-ruegg-12459|title=Ellis, Ulrich Ruegg (1904–1981)|publisher=''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]''|author=Andrew Moore|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism and life in Canberra==
From 1921 to 1922, Ellis worked in [[Melbourne]] as a member of a news agency serving regional newspapers. He later worked for metropolitan daily newspapers, and then in 1925 began writing for the ''Morning Post'', the newspaper of the [[Country Party (Victoria)|Victorian Country Party]]. Ellis moved to [[Canberra]] in 1927 as one of the first permanent press correspondents; he was one of the forerunners of the [[Canberra Press Gallery]]. He married Ray Arnot Maxwell, the daughter of federal MP [[George Maxwell (Australian politician)|George Maxwell]], on 19 December 1930. Ellis was a "passionate advocate of local self-government" for Canberra and an advocate for the improvement of the capital's amenities, which were those of a small country town.  He was the inaugural chairman of the Canberra Tourist Bureau from 1937 to 1940, and served on the [[Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council]], an elective office, from 1947 to 1951.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 1936, Ellis began working for the [[Department of Commerce (Australia)|Department of Commerce]] as a commercial intelligence officer. He moved to Melbourne in 1940 and joined the [[Department of Munitions]] in an administrative capacity overseeing 600 employees. In 1944, Ellis moved back to Canberra and joined the [[Department of Post-War Reconstruction]] as deputy director of public relations.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He wrote a letter to ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' in April 1945 criticising Interior Minister [[Joe Collings]], accusing him of "laugh[ing] with contempt in the face of the common principles of administrative justice" and calling him "unfit to administer his Department". He was subsequently charged under the Public Service Act and fined ₤2 for contravening regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/australian-public-service-commissions-new-social-media-guidelines-go-too-far-20170810-gxtj7l.html|title=Australian Public Service Commission's new social media guidelines go too far|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=10 August 2017|access-date=15 November 2018|author=Paul Malone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis's final public-service position was in the [[Department of Information (Australia)|Department of Information]] from 1946 to 1947. He subsequently established a rural lobby group, the Office of Rural Research.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Politics==
In 1928, Ellis was appointed private secretary to [[Earle Page]], the leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]].

In 1933, Ellis served as the publicity officer for [[Charles Hardy (Australian politician)|Charles Hardy]]'s Riverina Movement, which advocated the secession of the [[Riverina]] from the rest of New South Wales. The following year, he gave evidence before the New South Wales [[royal commission]] on new states, chaired by Judge [[Harold Sprent Nicholas]]. Ellis served on the executive of the [[New England New State Movement]] from 1948, and he and his wife moved to [[Armidale, New South Wales]], in 1960. He campaigned for the "Yes" vote in the 1967 New England secession referendum, which failed.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

During the 1950s, Ellis served as "publicist, valet, chauffeur, nursemaid and baggage handler" to [[Arthur Fadden]], the leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister. He published two histories of the Country Party: ''The Country Party: A Political and Social History of the Party in New South Wales'' (1958), and ''A History of the Australian Country Party'' (1963).&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=5H5EAAAAcAAJ Available on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bavarian authorities responded by laying political charges on him, for which he was imprisoned.&lt;ref name="bibliophile"&gt;{{cite book |title=Le bibliophile belge, Volume 12 : Histoire des livres—Essai d'un dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes et pseudonymes publiés en belgique |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ew4_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |pages=302–303 |language=French |access-date=2017-04-25 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison he wrote three German-language books that were well-received in Germany: ''Die Stimme aus dem Kerker'' (The Voice from the Dungeon), ''Kerkerblumen'' (Dungeon Flowers), and ''Die göttlichen Befreier'' (The Divine Liberator).&lt;ref name="bibliophile"/&gt;
