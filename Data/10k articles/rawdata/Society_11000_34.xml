'''African immigration to Canada''' comprises citizens of countries in [[Africa]] who emigrated to [[Canada]], as well as their descendants.

According to [[Statistics Canada]], African-born individuals comprised 13.4% of recent immigrants to Canada as of 2016. This was the second largest number of recent immigrants to the nation after Europe, and a four-fold increase from the number of African-born immigrants in 1971 (3.2%). As of 2016, the top five countries of birth of recent African-born immigrants to Canada were [[Nigeria]], [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]] and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="Perc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration and ethnocultural diversity: Key results from the 2016 Census |url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.pdf |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the population in Canada with an immigrant background, persons with ancestry from Africa were the youngest residents as of 2016, with the largest proportion aged between 0-14 years old (~12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Census in Brief - Children with an immigrant background: Bridging cultures |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/access_acces/alternative_alternatif.action?t=98-200-X2016015&amp;k=310&amp;l=eng&amp;loc=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016015/98-200-x2016015-eng.pdf |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many immigrants from [[French language|French]]-speaking African countries have settled in [[Quebec]]. Of these, most were from [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Senegal]], as well as Algeria, Morocco and [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Census in Brief - Linguistic integration of immigrants and official language populations in Canada |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/access_acces/alternative_alternatif.action?t=98-200-X2016017&amp;k=310&amp;l=eng&amp;loc=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016017/98-200-x2016017-eng.pdf |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Peru]]vian [[President of Peru|President]] '''[[Alberto Fujimori]] was arrested, tried, and convicted''' for a number of crimes related to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[human rights abuse]]s that occurred during his government. Fujimori was president from 1990 to 2000. His presidency ended when he fled the country in the midst of a scandal involving corruption and human rights violations.

Wanted in Peru, Fujimori maintained a self-imposed exile until his arrest while visiting [[Chile]] in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4994908.stm Conditional release for Fujimori], BBC News, 18 May 2006.

In December 2007, Fujimori was convicted of ordering an [[illegal search and seizure]], and was sentenced to six years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7139719.stm Fujimori jailed for abusing power], BBC News, 12 December 2007.

The verdict, delivered by a three-judge panel, marked the first time that an elected head of state has been extradited to his home country, tried, and convicted of human rights violations. Fujimori was specifically found guilty of murder, bodily harm, and two cases of kidnapping.&lt;ref name= Bloomberg2009&gt;Emery, Alex.

On 24 December 2017, President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] pardoned him on health grounds.&lt;ref name=pardon/&gt; The pardon was overturned by the Peruvian Supreme Court in October 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Peru-court-overturns-pardon-of-ex-leader-Fujimori-13278420.php|title=Peru court overturns pardon of ex-leader Fujimori|date=2018-10-04|work=seattlepi.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile in Japan==
After Fujimori fled to [[Japan]], the [[Politics of Peru|government of Peru]] requested his extradition. Because Japan recognizes Fujimori as a Japanese citizen rather than a Peruvian citizen due to the [[Master Nationality Rule]], and because Japan refuses to extradite its citizens to other countries, Fujimori was not extradited from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1198473.stm|date= 2 March 2001|title=Japan refuses to extradite Fujimori|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest in Chile==
On 6 November 2005, Alberto Fujimori unexpectedly arrived in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], on a private aircraft, having flown via [[Tijuana]] from [[Tokyo]]. His flight had passed through Peruvian airspace on its path from [[Mexico]] to [[Chile]]. There were numerous firings over alleged negligence in the handling of the Fujimori flight to Chile.&lt;ref name="China daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-11/23/content_497281.htm|title=Peruvian Interpol chief fired for negligence over Fujimori case |date=23 November 2005|accessdate=10 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411193431/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-11/23/content_497281.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As investigations continued, two Chilean and four Mexican immigration officers were dismissed for failing to notify superiors of Fujimori's stop at the time of his arrival. Colonel [[Carlos Medel]], head of [[Interpol]] in [[Lima]], was also fired for negligence, apparently having ordered his staff to switch off the 24-hour Interpol warning system at the time of the overflight.&lt;ref name="China daily"/&gt;

Mexican officials suggested Fujimori was not arrested in Mexico because there was no judicial order for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livinginperu.com/news-666-politics-mexican-authorities-say-they-had-no-extradition-order-for-fujimori/|title=Mexican authorities say they had no extradition order for Fujimori|author=Virginia Velasco|date=8 November 2005|publisher=Living in Peru|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian president [[Alejandro Toledo]], after learning of the arrival of Fujimori in Chile, called for an "urgent meeting" in the governmental palace. Toledo called Chile's foreign minister, Ignacio Walker, and requested the detention of Fujimori.&lt;ref name=capturado&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/politica/294330-fujimori-capturado-en-santiago|title=Fujimori capturado en Santiago|date=6 November 2005|publisher=La Republica|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, Fujimori was detained on an [[arrest warrant]] issued by a Chilean judge, who was told by Chile's [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]] to consider Lima's request for Fujimori's pre-trial detention, as part of the extradition process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4413176.stm ''Fujimori arrested on visit to Chile'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori was then transferred to the School of Investigations, Chile's [[Investigative Police]] academy, where he spent the night.&lt;ref name=capturado/&gt; Notified of the reasons for his arrest, Fujimori petitioned for provisional freedom during the extradition proceedings, but his petition was denied.&lt;ref name=cronologia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2006/05/18/219453/cronologia-de-la-permanencia-de-fujimori-en-chile.html|title=Cronología de la permanencia de Fujimori en Chile|publisher=El Mercurio|date=18 May 2006|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, he was transferred to the School of Gendarmerie, a training academy for corrections officers, where he was detained until May 2006.&lt;ref name=cronologia/&gt;

==Extradition proceedings==
The decision whether or not to extradite Fujimori was delegated by the Chilean government to the Supreme Court, following precedent dating to a 1932 extradition treaty between the two nations. Chilean law suggests that in addition to the terms of the treaty, extradition requests must also be based on whether there is sufficient evidence against the accused – not necessarily enough to convict him of the charges, but sufficient to justify (from a Chilean legal point of view) the indictments the accused faces. This meant that Peruvian prosecutors had to demonstrate that the crimes for which Fujimori has been charged in Peru were just as severe in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Witte, ''Fujimori Nearly Chokes to Death in His Chile Home'', ''The Santiago Times'' 10 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru, which had sixty days to issue an extradition request, sent a high-level delegation led by Interior Minister Rómulo Pizarro and a top prosecutor.&lt;ref name=deniedbail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4415740.stm|title=Fujimori is refused bail in Chile|date=8 November 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Japan asked for "fair treatment" for Fujimori.&lt;ref name=deniedbail/&gt;

On 18 May 2006 Fujimori was granted bail (set at US $2,830) by the Chilean Supreme Court and was released from detention and whisked away to a house rented for him by his family in the [[Las Condes]] neighborhood of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/news/extraditing-fujimori-other-dictator-chile|title=Extraditing Fujimori: The Other Dictator in Chile|publisher=NACLA|author=Benjamin Witte|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fujii Takahiko, one of the Japanese financiers who had been covering some of Fujimori's expenses, "Fujimori [calmly waited] for the decision of the Chilean Supreme Court because he [had] the assurance that he [would] not be extradited." It was reported that Fujii covered the cost of renting the house, while a cadre of businessmen and Japanese friends covered his living expenses. Fujii, a car exporter by trade, reported that Fujimori had largely forgotten his knowledge of the Japanese language.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/56171_1.php ''Aseguran que grupo de empresarios financia gastos de Fujimori en Chile'' (Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190048/http://images.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/56171_1.php |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/news/2774 Summary at the "Living in Peru" website]&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was granted provisional freedom, Fujimori was not allowed to leave Chile. There were fears among some Peruvians that he could have escaped from the country.

Fujimori arrived at a time of tense relations between Chile and Peru, after [[Congress of Peru|Peru's Congress]] passed a law the previous week in an attempt to reclaim sea territory from Chile. Chilean foreign minister, Ignacio Walker, said Fujimori's action demonstrated "a very imprudent, very irresponsible attitude, considering this is the most difficult week we have had with Peru in the last decade".&lt;ref name=manos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/11/07/internacional/1131363382.html|title=Chile afirma que no extraditará a Fujimori de forma inmediata al estar su caso en manos de la Justicia|publisher=El Mundo|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a media statement, Fujimori said that he would stay in Chile temporarily while launching his candidacy for Peruvian president in the April 2006 elections.&lt;ref name=manos/&gt;

The government of Peru sent a number of extradition requests to Chile concerning Fujimori. It requested his extradition to stand trial for murder in the cases of the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and the [[La Cantuta massacre]], both carried out by [[Grupo Colina]].&lt;ref name=FIDH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/PER/INT_CCPR_NGO_PER_105_9866_E.pdf|title=La extradición de Fujimori al Perú: Un imperativo de Justicia!|author=Luis Carlos Nieto, Luis Rodriguez Piñero, Juan Carlos Capurro, and Alirio Uribe|publisher=[[International Federation for Human Rights]]|date=May 2006|accessdate=2017-12-25|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also requested his extradition for kidnapping Samuel Dyer and [[Gustavo Gorriti]], both of whom were abducted by [[Peruvian Army]] personnel during Fujimori's [[Alberto Fujimori#1992 .22self-coup.22|self-coup]] and brought to the basements of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name=FIDH/&gt;

Additionally, he was charged with usurpation of powers and abuse of authority for ordering the illegal search and seizure of a house owned by [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]' wife; illicit association to commit a crime, [[embezzlement]], and inserting false statements in a public document for paying Montesinos US$15 million; illicit association to commit a crime and active [[Political corruption|corruption]] of authorities for paying congressmen to switch parties and inform on the opposition parties; telephonic interference or [[eavesdropping]], illicit association to commit a crime, and embezzlement for authorizing the illegal wiretapping of opposition figure's phones; and illicit association to commit a crime, embezzlement, and usurpation of powers for engaging in a fraudulent purchase of tractors from China and bribing newspapers and television stations with state money in order to obtain favorable news coverage.&lt;ref name=FIDH/&gt;
 
Subsequently, the Chilean judge overseeing the extradition proceedings refused to accept new evidence regarding the 10 corruption and two human rights charges, which, according to the BBC News' Dan Collyns, "would have prolonged the case by several months".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6160434.stm ''Fujimori judge rejects case delay'']&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2006, the Peruvian government issued a new arrest warrant for Fujimori, alleging that he ordered the death of 20 members of [[Sendero Luminoso]] in 1992. Fujimori denied the charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061122-083601-2121r ''Peru issues new warrant for Fujimori'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2007 Chile's Supreme Court rejected a motion for an additional investigation filed by lawyers representing Fujimori. The new ruling coincided with the Peruvian government's anger over a recent [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruling that found Peru guilty of crimes committed during former president’s regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justicetribune.com/?page=v2_article&amp;id=3658 ''Fujimori pulls Lima in opposite directions'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Peruvian government expressed fresh concern that Fujimori might try to escape from Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B245E3B0C-F384-4204-8208-FC55E7BE1B4B%7D&amp;language=EN ''Chile-Peru, Old and New Tensions'', Prensa Latina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190834/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B245E3B0C-F384-4204-8208-FC55E7BE1B4B%7D&amp;language=EN |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fujimori was on [[parole]], with stipulations banning him from leaving Chile, at the end of January 2007 he traveled to a beach resort aboard a private [[airplane]].

On 1 February 2007 [[Reuters]] reported that the [[Peru]]vian government's final report on Fujimori's [[extradition]] included additional evidence supporting the former president's links to [[human rights]] abuses.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bdnews24.com/world/2007/02/01/peru-to-present-fujimori-report-within-days|title=Peru to present Fujimori report within days|date=1 February 2007|publisher=bdnews24.com|author=Reuters|accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Carlos Briceno, Peru's special [[Political corruption|corruption]] [[prosecutor]], "We've practically finished the report, in which there is irrefutable proof [against Fujimori]".&lt;ref name=report/&gt; For his part, Fujimori denied the human rights and [[embezzlement]] charges.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Pedro Fujimori==
On 8 February 2007 the Peruvian government filed a formal request with the United States for the extradition of Fujimori's younger brother, [[Pedro Fujimori]]. According to the head of the Peruvian Justice Ministry's Unit for Extraditions, [[Omar Chehade]], Pedro Fujimori was charged with corruption associated with reception of illegal donations for an NGO, Apenkai, founded at the outset of Fujimori’s first term in office. Chehade reported to Reuters that Pedro Fujimori oversaw Japanese donations to the Peruvian government, and that he allegedly siphoned off as much as US $30 million into his own personal bank accounts in the United States. A spokesperson for the Fujimorista party, Congressman [[Carlos Raffo]], denied the charges calling them unsubstantiated, and noted that there are no signs of corruption on the part of Pedro Fujimori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/news/3164 ''Peru files extradition request for brother of ex-President Fujimori'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chilean judge rejects Fujimori extradition==
On 20 July 2007 the Chilean Supreme Court judge [[Orlando Álvarez]], ruled that he had not found any evidence linking former president Alberto Fujimori with all the corruption cases and alleged human rights violations of which the Toledo congress had accused him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juicioysancionafujimori.org/ingles/documentos/Alvarez.doc Excerpts from Judge Orlando Álvarez Hernández’s decision regarding the extradition of Alberto Fujimori from Chile to Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043717/http://www.juicioysancionafujimori.org/ingles/documentos/Alvarez.doc |date=16 February 2008 }}. Translated by Michael Baney.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Álvarez stated that all the accusations were based on hearsay; "he [Fujimori] was supposed to know those criminal acts".&lt;ref name=apela&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urgente24.com/161267-peru-apela-decision-chilena-contra-extradicion-de-fujimori|title=Perú apela decisión chilena contra extradición de Fujimori|date=13 July 2007|publisher=Urgente 24|accessdate=2017-12-25|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion was immediately appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=apela/&gt;

==Chilean Supreme Court grants Fujimori extradition==
The Chilean Supreme Court granted Fujimori's extradition to Peru on 21 September 2007, on 7 of 13 charges. The [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] related charges were accepted unanimously, while four other corruption-related charges were passed by a majority of votes. One corruption charge was passed unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070921/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/chile_fujimori;_ylt=AmklDZsPHqE5XvCwb7dkYfys0NUE ''Chile's Supreme Court grants    Fujimori's extradition to Peru'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Peruvian police sent an airplane to receive Fujimori. The plane (with Peru's General Director of National Police, David Rodriguez, four Interpol officers and physicians) arrived in Santiago on the morning of 22 September. The following day, the plane returned to Lima's Las Palmas air force base with Fujimori on board. He was flown by helicopter to a police base, to be held in detention until a permanent facility was prepared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6268873.html ''Peruvian police to take Fujimori back from Chile'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==First conviction==
Fujimori confessed that he had ordered a warrantless search of [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]'s wife's apartment,&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; and on 11 December 2007, the Peruvian court sentenced him to six years in prison and fined him 400,000 soles (135,000 U.S. dollars) for abuse of powers in ordering this search, which took place shortly before he left office.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peru's Fujimori sentenced to six years for abuse of power |agency=AFP |date=11 December 2007 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jevvOxthPS9xWVObkNOZ5o3shK1g |accessdate=20 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412122416/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jevvOxthPS9xWVObkNOZ5o3shK1g |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aprodeh.org.pe/fujimori2007/documentos/Sentencia_allanamiento_fujimori.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043717/http://www.aprodeh.org.pe/fujimori2007/documentos/Sentencia_allanamiento_fujimori.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2008 }} Sentence in the case&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Peru]] upheld Fujimori's sentence of six years in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Corte Suprema de la República. 10 December 2008. [http://www.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema/spe/Documentos/exp_AV-13-2003_2da_SPE_150408.pdf Resolution 17-2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625052155/http://www.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema/spe/Documentos/exp_AV-13-2003_2da_SPE_150408.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peruvian general elections==
[[Martha Chávez]] was ''[[Sí Cumple]]'''s presidential candidate in the [[Peruvian national election, 2006|April 9, 2006 general election]] (under the ''Alianza por el Futuro'' banner). Fujimori's daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori]] was a congressional candidate representing the same alliance. While Chávez got 7.43% of the first-round vote (placed 4th) for presidency and was eliminated, Keiko Fujimori received the highest vote for any single candidate (with 602,869 votes) and took one of ''Sí Cumple's'' 13 seats in the new Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://200.48.60.75/resultados2006/1ravuelta/index.onpe 2006 Peru Election Results (Spanish)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of ''Sí Cumple'''s members have occupied powerful positions in congress, such as [[Luisa María Cuculiza]], who was first elected to Congress in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.elcomercio.pe/politica/gobierno/cuculiza-dice-que-estelizaciones-durante-fujimorismo-fuerontotalmente-voluntarias-noticia-755188|title=Cuculiza dice que esterilizaciones durante el fujimorismo fueron "totalmente voluntarias"|publisher=El Comercio|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=2017-12-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolando Souza, who was formerly

Keiko Fujimori, was president of the [[Peruvian-Chilean Friendship Commission]].

==Japanese politics==
In June 2007, Fujimori announced his candidacy for the [[House of Councillors]], the upper house of the [[Diet of Japan]], under the banner of the [[People's New Party]], a minor party with only eight lawmakers. Still under house arrest in Chile at the time, Fujimori's initial campaign statements were conveyed by party head [[Shizuka Kamei]]. Japan's government had determined in 2000 that Fujimori holds Japanese citizenship. The Japanese [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]] issued a statement in response, pointing out that there is no law banning participation in an election by someone under house arrest in a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070629a2.html ''Prisoner Fujimori to run in Japanese elections'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement sparked speculation that Fujimori's candidacy was a maneuver to win [[diplomatic immunity]] as an elected official and avoid trial in Peru. Chilean President [[Michelle Bachelet]] said her country's Supreme Court would not be influenced by the move and would soon decide whether to grant an extradition request to return Fujimori to Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070628/ap_on_re_as/japan_fujimori_7 ''Fujimori's Japanese intentions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2007, Chile's Supreme Court turned down the Peruvian government's request that Fujimori be extradited there to face charges of human rights violations; however he remained under house arrest in Chile and it was unclear whether he would be permitted to depart for Japan. Though much of the Japanese public have a favorable view of Fujimori due to his role in the resolution of the 1997 [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]], members of the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] and the [[Japanese Communist Party]] questioned his commitment to Japan and accused him of using the election to avoid justice in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707130086.html ''Odd Man Out'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan indicated on 5 July 2007 that it had no plans to ask Chile to allow Alberto Fujimori to return for that month's upper house elections. The leader of the People's New Party had urged Japan's Foreign Minister to take up the issue with the government of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070705/wl_asia_afp/japanperuchilefujimoripolitics_070705083803 ''Japan withdraws request to Chile re Alberto Fujimori'']&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori ultimately lost the election.

==Conviction for human rights abuses==
On 7 April 2009, a three-judge panel of Peru's Supreme Court convicted Fujimori on charges of [[human rights abuse]]s, declaring that the "charges against him have been proven beyond all reasonable doubt".&lt;ref&gt;The Judgment Against Fujimori for Human Rights Violations.

[[Ronald Gamarra Herrera]], Executive Secretary of National Coordinator for Human Rights of Peru and one of the lawyers representing the civil parties –the families of the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta victims– said to the press that "there has not been hate, or revenge, or cruelty in Fujimori's trial. What there has been is justice. We are not happy for the pain of a man, nor of what tragedy his family is going through. But yes it is comforting to know that justice has been served and that the victims, after so many years, can rest in peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Interview with Ronald Gamarra: Fujimori appeal could resolve itself in a more political rather than judicial context|url=http://fujimoriontrial.org/?p=663|work=[[Fujimori on Trial]]|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' claimed that international observers had "hailed the trial as a model of due process even before the verdict was read out". Michael Reed of the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] stated that, "Throughout 15 months the whole Peruvian people have been actively living this process. This social engagement is important … the decision will in fact demonstrate polarisation. The issue is how the Peruvian state and Peruvian society deal with that polarization towards the future." Maria McFarland, a Senior Researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]], noted that the verdict was "absolutely the right decision&amp;nbsp;... [and] well grounded in all the evidence" and that the special court would "go down in history as a model of what we want to see in terms of rule of law and justice and progress in Latin America. So much has always been focused on the power of the executive and the president and the strong man; now suddenly the judiciary is having a say."&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Partlow|first=Joshua|title=Former Peruvian President Fujimori Convicted in Murder, Kidnapping Trial|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/07/AR2009040701345.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Fujimori's conviction had been announced, riots broke out in the streets. In the [[Ate District]], approximately twenty police officers had to break up a fight between members of Fujimori's political party and a group from the local Peru's Workers Confederation (CTP). It was believed that the riot broke out when about fifty CTP members went to the police station and provoked a fight with some 300 Fujimori supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruiz|first=Israel|title=Riots break out after Peru's Alberto Fujimori found guilty|url=http://www.livinginperu.com/news-8685-law-and-order-riots-break-out-after-perus-alberto-fujimori-found-guilty|work=Living in Peru|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=7 April 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090412130158/http://www.livinginperu.com/news-8685-law-and-order-riots-break-out-after-perus-alberto-fujimori-found-guilty|archivedate=12 April 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the court, relatives of victims clashed with Fujimori supporters; the fights were broken up by riot police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Ex-Peruvian leader convicted in death squad trial |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090407/fujimori_trial_090407/20090407?hub=World |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408215836/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090407/fujimori_trial_090407/20090407?hub=World |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2009 |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Correo]]'', a right-wing newspaper in Lima, published a poll on 9 April claiming that 59.4% was against Fujimori's conviction, with rejection of the sentence reaching 68.3% among the lower classes. Nevertheless, the poll doesn't clarify if those interviewed considered Fujimori innocent or if they considered him guilty but did't approve of the sentence itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correoperu.com.pe/correo/nota.php?txtEdi_id=4&amp;txtSecci_id=101&amp;txtSecci_parent=&amp;txtNota_id=34893 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410174652/http://www.correoperu.com.pe/correo/nota.php?txtEdi_id=4&amp;txtSecci_id=101&amp;txtSecci_parent=&amp;txtNota_id=34893 |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American anthropology''' has [[culture]] as its central and unifying concept. This most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human [[experience]]s [[symbol]]ically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:

# [[biological anthropology]]
# [[linguistic anthropology]]
# [[cultural anthropology]]
# [[archaeology]]

Research in these fields has influenced anthropologists working in other countries to different degrees.

== Biological anthropology ==

{{synthesis|date=May 2013}}
Discussion concerning culture among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] centers around two debates. First, is culture uniquely human or shared by other species (most notably, other primates)? This is an important question, as the theory of [[evolution]] holds that humans are descended from (now extinct) non-human primates. Second, how did culture evolve among human beings?

Gerald Weiss noted that although Tylor's classic definition of culture was restricted to humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like [[Robert Yerkes]] and [[Jane Goodall]] thus argued that since [[chimpanzee]]s have learned behaviors, they have culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yerkes 1943 ''Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]].  51–52, 189, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall 1963 "My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees" ''National Geographic'' 124: 308&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Andrew 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bryan 1963 "The Essential Morphological basis for Human Culture" ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keleman 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303 p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in nonhuman primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 301–328&lt;/ref&gt;

This scientific debate is complicated by ethical concerns. The subjects of primatology are non-human primates, and whatever culture these primates have is threatened by human activity. After reviewing the research on primate culture, W. C. McGrew concluded, "[a] discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primates are endangered by their human cousins.  Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival [i.e. to the survival of primate cultures]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 323&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrew suggests a definition of culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists do not have access to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew suggests that we view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
# A new pattern of behavior is invented, or an existing one is modified.
# The innovator transmits this pattern to another.
# The form of the pattern is consistent within and across performers, perhaps even in terms of recognizable stylistic features.
# The one who acquires the pattern retains the ability to perform it long after having acquired it.
# The pattern spreads across social units in a population. These social units may be families, clans, troops, or bands.
# The pattern endures across generations.
McGrew admits that all six criteria may be strict, given the difficulties in observing primate behavior in the wild. But he also insists on the need to be as inclusive as possible, on the need for a definition of culture that "casts the net widely":

{{quote|Culture is considered to be group-specific behavior that is acquired, at least in part, from social influences.  Here, group is considered to be the species-typical unit, whether it be a troop, lineage, subgroup, or so on.  ''Prima facie'' evidence of culture comes from within-species but across-group variation in behavior, as when a pattern is persistent in one community of chimpanzees but is absent from another, or when different communities perform different versions of the same pattern.  The suggestion of culture in action is stronger when the difference across the groups cannot be explained solely by ecological factors ....|&lt;ref&gt;W.C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 305&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Charles Frederick Voegelin pointed out, if "culture" is reduced to "learned behavior," then all animals have culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Voegelin 1951 "Culture, Language and the Human Organism" ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'' 7: 370&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly all specialists agree that all [[Primate cognition|primate species evidence common cognitive skills]]: knowledge of object-permanence, cognitive mapping, the ability to categorize objects, and creative problem solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}} Moreover, all primate species show evidence of shared social skills: they recognize members of their social group; they form direct relationships based on degrees of kinship and rank; they recognize third-party social relationships; they predict future behavior; and they cooperate in problem-solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}}

Nevertheless, the term "culture" applies to non-human animals only if we define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars tend to think that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved to be different from other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for "culture".

Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'' and ''Pan paniscus'') are humans' (''Homo sapiens'') closest living relatives; both are descended from a common ancestor which lived around seven million years ago. [[Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae|Human evolution]] has been rapid with modern humans appearing about 340,000 years ago. During this time humanity evolved three distinctive features:
:(a) the creation and use of conventional symbols, including linguistic symbols and their derivatives, such as written language and mathematical symbols and notations; (b) the creation and use of complex tools and other instrumental technologies; and (c) the creation and participation in complex social organization and institutions.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}} According to [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Michael Tomasello]], "where these complex and species-unique behavioral practices, and the cognitive skills that underlie them, came from" is a fundamental anthropological question. Given that contemporary humans and chimpanzees are far more different from horses and zebras, or rats and mice, and that the evolution of this great difference occurred in such a short period of time, "our search must be for some small difference that made a big difference&amp;nbsp;– some adaptation, or small set of adaptations, that changed the process of primate cognitive evolution in fundamental ways."  According to Tomasello, the answer to this question must form the basis of a scientific definition of "human culture."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}}

In a recent review of the major research on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called "the [[ratchet effect]]:" innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." The key point is that children are born good at a particular kind of social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls "imitative learning," (as opposed to "[[Emulation (observational learning)|emulative learning]]" characteristic of other primates) and second,  the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates).  Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect.

The kind of learning found among other primates is "emulation learning," which "focuses on the environmental events involved&amp;nbsp;– results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced&amp;nbsp;– rather than on the actions that produced those results."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=520}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Tomasello 1990 "Cultural Transmission in the Tool Use and Communicatory Signaling of Chimpanzees?" in ''"Language" and Intelligence in Monkeys and Apes: Comparative Developmental Perspectives'' ed. S. Parker, K. Bibson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 274–311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press, pp. 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;  Tomasello emphasizes that emulation learning is a highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach-object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nagell, K., Olguin, K. and Tomasello, M. 1993 "Processes of social learning in the tool use of chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and human children (''Homo sapiens'')" in ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'' 107: 174–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of emulation learning are well documented among primates.  Notable examples include Japanese [[macaque]] potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed in her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over the next two years seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, and by the end of the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kawamura 1959 "The process of subcultural propagation among Japanese macaques" ''Primates'' 2: 43–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;M. Kawai 1965 "Newly acquired pre-cultural behavior of the natural troop of Japanese monkeys on Koshima Islet" ''Primates'' 6: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt; Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food.&lt;ref&gt;E. Visalberghi and D. M. Fragaszy 1990 "Food washing behavior in tufted Capuchin monkeys, ''Cebusapella'', and crabeating macaques, ''Macaca fasciculais''" ''Animal Behavior'' 40: 829–836&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=519}}

Chimpanzees exhibit a variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for termites using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites.  Some of this variation may be the result of "environmental shaping" (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects.  When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press. pp: 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of learning characteristic of human children is [[imitative learning]], which "means reproducing an instrumental act understood intentionally."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} Human infants begin to display some evidence of this form of learning between the ages of nine and 12 months, when infants fix their attention not only on an object, but on the gaze of an adult which enables them to use adults as points of reference and thus "act on objects in the way adults are acting on them."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=513}} This dynamic is well documented and has also been termed "joint engagement" or "joint attention."&lt;ref&gt;R. Bakerman and L. Adamson 1984 "Coordinating attention to people and objects in mother-infant and peer-infant interaction" in ''Child Development'' 55: 1278–1289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Moore and P. Dunham 1995 ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to this dynamic is the infant's growing capacity to recognize others as "intentional agents:" people "with the power to control their spontaneous behavior" and who "have goals and make active choices among behavioral means for attaining those goals."&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello 1995 "Joint attention as social cognition" in ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development,'' ed. C. Moore and P. Dunham.  Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press, pp. 103–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of skills in joint attention by the end of a human child's first year of life provides the basis for the development of imitative learning in the second year. In one study 14-month-old children imitated an adult's over-complex method of turning on a light, even when they could have used an easier and more natural motion to the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Meltzoff 1988 "Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 24: 470–476&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, 16-month-old children interacted with adults who alternated between a complex series of motions that appeared intentional and a comparable set of motions that appeared accidental; they imitated only those motions that appeared intentional.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, N. Akhtar, M. Tomasello 1998 "Sixteen-month old infants differentially imitate intentional and accidental actions" in ''Infant Behavior &amp; Development'' 21: 315–330&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of 18-month old children revealed that children imitate actions that adults intend, yet in some way fail, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;A. Meltzoff 1995 "Understanding the intentions of others: re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 31: 838–850&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomasello emphasizes that this kind of imitative learning "relies fundamentally on infants' tendency to identify with adults, and on their ability to distinguish in the actions of others the underlying goal and the different means that might be used to achieve it."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=514}} He calls this kind of imitative learning "cultural learning because the child is not just learning about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them&amp;nbsp;— in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=515}}&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M., Kruger, A. &amp; Ratner, H. 1993 "Cultural learning" ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' 16, 495–552&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual "understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Emulation learning and imitative learning are two different adaptations that can only be assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object.  Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared on the basis of these results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an [[evolution]]ary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task.  Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the "ratchet effect" that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|pp=520–521}}

Tomasello further argues that cultural learning is essential for language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. "In general, for the vast majority of words in their language, children must find a way to learn in the ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello and M. Barton 1994 "Learning Words in non-Ostensive Contexts" ''Developmental Psychology'' 30: 639–650&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Akhtar and M. Tomasello 1996 "Twenty-four month old children learn words for absent objects and actions" in ''British Journal of Developmental Psychology'' 14: 79–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello, R. Strosberg, N. Akhtar 1996 "Eighteen-month old children learn words in non-ostensive contexts" in ''Journal of Child Language''; 23: 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello concludes that "a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Tomasello's 1999 review of the research contrasting human and non-human primate learning strategies confirms [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Ralph Holloway]]'s 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue in the evolution of ''H. sapiens'', and the key to understanding "culture," "is how man organizes his experience." Culture is "the ''imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment.''"{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}} This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=396}}

In other words, whereas McGrew argues that anthropologists must focus on behaviors like communication and tool-use because they have no access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest [[stone tool]]s in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the question is not ''whether'' other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the ''way'' they do these things. "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," and other examples of primate tool-use and learning "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=400}} Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic.  In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}

In Holloway's view, our non-human ancestors, like those of modern chimpanzees and other primates, shared motor and sensory skills, curiosity, memory, and intelligence, with perhaps differences in degree. He adds: "It is when these are integrated with the unique attributes of arbitrary production (symbolization) and imposition that man qua cultural man appears."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

He also adds:

{{quote|I have suggested above that whatever culture may be, it includes "the imposition of arbitrary forms upon the environment."  This phrase has two components. One is a recognition that the relationship between the coding process and the phenomenon (be it a tool, social network, or abstract principle) is non-iconic. The other is an idea of man as a creature who can make delusional systems work—who imposes his fantasies, his non-iconic constructs (and constructions), upon the environment.  The altered environment shapes his perceptions, and these are again forced back on the environment, are incorporated into the environment, and press for further adaptation.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}}}}

This is comparable to the "ratcheting" aspect suggested by Tomasello and others that enabled human evolution to accelerate. Holloway concludes that the first instance of symbolic thought among humans provided a "kick-start" for brain development, tool complexity, social structure, and language to evolve through a constant dynamic of positive feedback. "This interaction between the propensity to structure the environment arbitrarily and the feedback from the environment to the organism is an emergent process, a process different in kind from anything that preceded it."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

Linguists [[Charles Hockett]] and R. Ascher have identified thirteen design-features of language, some shared by other forms of animal communication. One feature that distinguishes human language is its tremendous productivity; in other words, competent speakers of a language are capable of producing an exponential number of original utterances. This productivity seems to be made possible by a few critical features unique to human language. One is "duality of patterning," meaning that human language consists of the articulation of several distinct processes, each with its own set of rules: combining [[phonemes]] to produce [[morphemes]], combining [[morphemes]] to produce words, and combining words to produce sentences. This means that a person can master a relatively limited number of signals and sets of rules, to create infinite combinations.  Another crucial element is that human language is [[symbol]]ic: the sound of words (or their shape, when written) typically bear no relation to what they represent.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher 1964 "The Human Revolution" in ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 135–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, their meaning is arbitrary. That words have meaning is a matter of convention. Since the meaning of words are arbitrary, any word may have several meanings, and any object may be referred to using a variety of words; the actual word used to describe a particular object depends on the context, the intention of the speaker, and the ability of the listener to judge these appropriately.  As Tomasello notes,

{{quote|An individual language user looks at a tree and, before drawing the attention of her interlocutor to that tree, must decide, based on her assessment of the listener's current knowledge and expectations, whether to say "that tree over there," "it," "the oak," "that hundred-year-oak," "the tree," "the bagswing tree," "that thing in the front yard," "the ornament," "the embarrassment," or any of a number of other expressions.  ... And these decisions are not made on the basis of the speaker's direct goal with respect to the object or activity involved, but rather that they are made on the basis of her goal with respect to the listener's interest and attention to that object or activity. This is why symbolic cognition and communication and imitative learning go hand-in-hand.|{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=517}}}}

Holloway argues that the stone tools associated with genus ''Homo'' have the same features of human language:
{{quote|Returning to matter of syntax, rules, and concatenated activity mentioned above, almost any model which describes a language process can also be used to describe tool-making.  This is hardly surprising.  Both activities are concatenated, both have rigid rules about the serialization of unit activities (the grammar, syntax), both are hierarchical systems of activity (as is any motor activity), and both produce arbitrary configurations which thence become part of the environment, either temporarily or permanently.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}}}

He also adds:

{{quote|Productivity can be seen in the facts that basic types were probably used for multiple purposes, that tool industries tend to expand with time, and that a slight variation on a basic pattern may be made to meet some new functional requisite. ''Elements of a basic "vocabulary" of motor operations—flakes, detachment, rotation, preparation of striking platform, etc.—are used in different combinations to produce dissimilar tools, with different forms, and supposedly, different uses''. . . . Taking each motor event alone, no one action is complete; each action depends on the prior one and requires a further one, and each is dependent on another ax on the original plan. In other words, at each point of the action except the last, the piece is not "satisfactory" in structure. Each unit action is meaningless by itself in the sense of the use of the tool; it is meaningful only in the context of the whole completed set of actions culminating in the final product. This exactly parallels language.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=402}}}}

As Tomasello demonstrates, symbolic thought can operate only in a particular social environment:

{{quote|Arbitrary symbols enforce consensus of perceptions, which not only allows members to communicate about the same objects in terms of space and time (as in hunting) but it also makes it possible for social relationships to be standardized and manipulated through symbols. It means that idiosyncrasies are smoothed out and perceived within classes of behavior. By enforcing perceptual invariance, symbols also enforce social behavioral constancy, and enforcing social behavioral constancy is a prerequisite to differential task-role sectors in a differentiated social group adapting not only to the outside environment but to its own membership.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=406}}}}

[[Biological anthropology|Biological anthropologist]] Terrence Deacon, in a synthesis of over twenty years of research on human evolution, human neurology, and primatology, describes this "ratcheting effect" as a form of "Baldwinian Evolution." Named after [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin|James Baldwin]], this describes a situation in which an animal's behavior has evolutionary consequences when it changes the natural environment and thus the selective forces acting on the animal.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=322}}

{{quote|Once some useful behavior spreads within a population and becomes more important for subsistence, it will generate selection pressures on genetic traits that support its propagation ... Stone and symbolic tools, which were initially acquired with the aid of flexible ape-learning abilities, ultimately turned the tables on their users and forced them to adapt to a new niche opened by these technologies.  Rather than being just useful tricks, these behavioral prostheses for obtaining food and organizing social behaviors became indispensable elements in a new adaptive complex.  The origin of "humanness" can be defined as that point in our evolution where these tools became the {{sic|?|principle}} source of selection on our bodies and brains.  It is the diagnostic of ''Homo symbolicus''.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=344}}}}

According to Deacon, this occurred between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, when we have the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=340}} More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that ''Australopithecines'', like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of ''Australopithecine'' history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=347}} This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus ''Homo''.

The question for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes could have made the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of ''H. sapiens'' began with ancestors who did not yet have "culture," what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)?  Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to ''H. sapiens'' to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species:
# Both males and females usually contribute effort towards the rearing of their offspring, though often to differing extents and in very different ways.
# In all societies, the great majority of adult males and females are bound by long-term, exclusive sexual access rights and prohibitions to particular individuals of the opposite sex.
# They maintain these exclusive sexual relations while living in modest to large-sized, multi-male, multi-female, cooperative social groups.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=384–385}} 
Moreover, there is one feature common to all known human foraging societies (all humans prior to ten or fifteen thousand years ago), and markedly different from other primates: "the use of meat. . . . The appearance of the first stone tools nearly 2.5 million years ago almost certainly correlates with a radical shift in foraging behavior to gain access to meat."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=386}} Deacon does not believe that symbolic thought was necessary for hunting or tool-making (although tool-making may be a reliable index of symbolic thought); rather, it was necessary for the success of distinctive social relations.

The key is that while men and women are equally effective foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression plays an important role in maintaining sexual access to mate(s).

{{quote|Human reliance on resources that are relatively unavailable to females with infants selects not only for cooperation between a child's father and mother but also for the cooperation of other relatives and friends, including elderly individuals and juveniles, who can be relied upon for assistance. The special demands of acquiring meat and caring for infants in our own evolution together contribute to the underlying impetus for the third characteristic feature of human reproductive patterns: cooperative group living.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=386–387}}}}

What is uniquely characteristic about human societies is what required symbolic cognition, which consequently leads to the evolution of culture: "cooperative, mixed-sex social groups, with significant male care and provisioning of offspring, and relatively stable patterns of reproductive exclusion." This combination is relatively rare in other species because it is "highly susceptible to disintegration."  Language and culture provide the glue that holds it together.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=388}}

Chimpanzees also, on occasion, hunt meat; in most cases, however, males consume the meat immediately, and only on occasion share with females who happen to be nearby. Among chimpanzees, hunting for meat increases when other sources of food become scarce, but under these conditions sharing decreases. The first forms of symbolic thinking made stone tools possible, which in turn made hunting for meat a more dependable source of food for our nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms of social communication that make sharing between males and females, but also among males, decreasing sexual competition:

{{quote|So the socio-ecological problem posed by the transition to a meat-supplemented subsistence strategy is that it cannot be utilized without a social structure which guarantees unambiguous and exclusive mating and is sufficiently egalitarian to sustain cooperation via shared or parallel reproductive interests. This problem can be solved symbolically.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=396–397}}}}

Symbols and symbolic thinking thus make possible a central feature of social relations in every human population: reciprocity. Evolutionary scientists have developed [[Inclusive fitness|a model]] to explain [[reciprocal altruism]] among closely related individuals. Symbolic thought makes possible reciprocity between distantly related individuals.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=397–401}}

== Archaeology ==

In the 19th century [[archaeology]] was often a supplement to [[history]], and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] and [[stratigraphy]], thus marking their location in time and space. [[Franz Boas]] established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]] and American archaeologist [[W. C. McKern]] independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking about the people who produced it&amp;nbsp;— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods.  Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model:
# An individual artifact, which has surface, shape, and technological attributes (e.g. an arrowhead)
# A sub-assemblage, consisting of artifacts that are found, and were likely used, together (e.g. an arrowhead, bow and knife)
# An assemblage of sub-assemblages that together constitute the archaeological site (e.g. the arrowhead, bow and knife; a pot and the remains of a hearth; a shelter)
Childe argued that a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts" is an "[[archaeological culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;V. Gordon Childe 1929 ''The Danube in Prehistory'' Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By R. Lee Lyman and Michael J. O'Brien, 2003 ''W.C. McKern and the Midwestern Taxonomic Method.''  University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt;  Childe and others viewed "each archaeological culture ... the manifestation in material terms of a specific ''people''."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, 2008 ''Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice'' Fifth edition.  New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] systematized the methods and concepts that archaeologists had developed and proposed a general model for the archaeological contribution to knowledge of cultures.  He began with the mainstream understanding of culture as the product of human cognitive activity, and the Boasian emphasis on the subjective meanings of objects as dependent on their cultural context.  He defined culture as "a mental phenomenon, consisting of the contents of minds, not of material objects or observable behavior."{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p= 96}}  He then devised a three-tiered model linking cultural anthropology to archeology, which he called [[conjunctive archaeology]]:
# Culture, which is unobservable (behavior) and nonmaterial
# Behaviors resulting from culture, which are observable and nonmaterial
# Objectifications, such as artifacts and architecture, which are the result of behavior and material
That is, material artifacts were the material residue of culture, but not culture itself.{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p=100}}  Taylor's point was that the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people.  Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented.  One reason was that his three-tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.685&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunnel 1986 "Five Decades of American Archaeology" in ''American Archaeology Past and Future: A Celebration of the Society for American Archaeology, 1935–1985''.  D. Meltzer and J. Sabloff, eds.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Leslie White's former student [[Lewis Binford]] proposed a new model for anthropological archaeology, called "the New Archaeology" or "[[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]]," based on White's definition of culture as "the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see White 1959 ''The Evolution of Culture'' New York: McGraw Hill p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition allowed Binford to establish archaeology as a crucial field for the pursuit of the methodology of Julian Steward's cultural ecology:

{{quote|The comparative study of cultural systems with variable technologies in a similar environmental range or similar technologies in differing environments is a major methodology of what Steward (1955: 36–42) has called "cultural ecology," and certainly is a valuable means of increasing our understanding of cultural processes. Such a methodology is also useful in elucidating the structural relationships between major cultural sub-systems such as the social and ideological sub-systems.|&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change''. University of Illinois Press, Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Binford proposed an archaeology that would be central to the dominant project of cultural anthropologists at the time (culture as non-genetic adaptations to the environment); the "new archaeology" was the cultural anthropology (in the form of cultural ecology or ecological anthropology) of the past.

In the 1980s, there was a movement in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.684&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same period, then-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]] developed "[[post-processual archaeology]]" as an alternative.  Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but ''as'' culture itself.  Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation.  Instead, he "is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which material items, artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes."&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) pp. 687–6874&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1982 book, ''Symbols in Action'', evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, as an alternative to White and Steward's materialist view of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1982 ''Symbols in action: ethnoarchaeological studies of material culture''  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1991 textbook, ''Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology'' Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1986 ''Reading the past: current approaches to interpretation in archaeology'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic anthropology ==

The connection between culture and language has been noted as far back as the classical period and probably long before. The ancient Greeks, for example, distinguished between civilized peoples and [[Barbarian|bárbaroi]] "those who babble", i.e. those who speak unintelligible languages.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, Paul. 2003. "White slaves, African masters." The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 588(1): 90–111. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that different groups speak different, unintelligible languages is often considered more tangible evidence for cultural differences than other less obvious cultural traits.

The German romanticists of the 19th century such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], often saw language not just as one cultural trait among many but rather as the direct expression of a people's national character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such as culture in a kind of condensed form. Herder for example suggests, "''Denn jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache''" (Since every people is a People, it has its own national culture expressed through its own language).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anderson, Benedict R.O'G. 1983. ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.'' London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas, founder of American anthropology, like his German forerunners, maintained that the shared language of a community is the most essential carrier of their common culture. Boas was the first anthropologist who considered it unimaginable to study the culture of a foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. For Boas, the fact that the intellectual culture of a people was largely constructed, shared and maintained through the use of language, meant that understanding the language of a cultural group was the key to understanding its culture. At the same time, though, Boas and his students were aware that culture and language are not directly dependent on one another. That is, groups with widely different cultures may share a common language, and speakers of completely unrelated languages may share the same fundamental cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1921:228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1995: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other scholars have suggested that the form of language determines specific cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Von Humboldt, Wilhelm. 1820. ''Über das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwicklung''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the notion of [[linguistic determinism]], which states that the form of language determines individual thought. While Boas himself rejected a causal link between language and culture, some of his intellectual heirs entertained the idea that habitual patterns of speaking and thinking in a particular language may influence the culture of the linguistic group.{{sfn|Whorf|1941}} Such belief is related to the theory of [[linguistic relativity]]. Boas, like most modern anthropologists, however, was more inclined to relate the interconnectedness between language and culture to the fact that, as [[B.L. Whorf]] put it, "they have grown up together".{{sfn|Whorf|1941|p=293}}&lt;ref&gt;See also e.g. Boas, Franz. 1911. "Introduction." ''Handbook of American Indian Languages''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[origin of language]], understood as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and the origin of complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin I. Dunbar]] has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged as a means of using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example [[Social grooming|grooming]]. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the [[Structuralism|structural]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of [[semiotics]]. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound &lt;nowiki&gt;[kau]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the meaning "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of "wearing a crown" and the cultural meaning of "being king". In this way it can be argued that culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;(Duranti 1997: 49)(Mannheim &amp; Tedlock 1995: 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in&amp;nbsp;– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.

However, languages, now understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. In linguistics such different ways of using the same language are called "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]". For example, the English language is spoken differently in the US, the UK and Australia, and even within English-speaking countries there are hundreds of [[dialect]]s of English that each signals a belonging to a particular region and/or subculture. For example, in the UK the [[cockney]] dialect signals its speakers' belonging to the group of lower class workers of east London. Differences between varieties of the same language often consist in different pronunciations and vocabulary, but also sometimes of different grammatical systems and very often in using different [[Style (sociolinguistics)|styles]] (e.g. cockney [[rhyming slang]] or [[Legalese#Legalese|lawyers' jargon]]). Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]] and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.

A community's ways of speaking or signing are a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are. Language use is a way of establishing and displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. Linguists call different ways of speaking language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[Style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Patricia. (1986) "The acquisition of communicative style in Japanese." In B. Schieffelin and E. Ochs (eds) ''Language Socialization across Cultures''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also in different "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of "social deixis", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;Foley 1997 p??&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor" or "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt; Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special [[Baby talk|ways of speaking to infants and children]]. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail ''not speaking'' to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a [[taboo]] against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|Japanese]] and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;Men's and Women's Speech in Koasati, Mary R. Haas, ''Language'', Vol. 20, No. 3 (Jul.&amp;nbsp;– Sep., 1944), pp. 142–149 (also summarized in Foley 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural anthropology ==

=== Universal versus particular ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Boas]] established modern American anthropology as the study of the sum total of human phenomena. c. 1915]]

The modern anthropological concept of culture has its origins in the 19th century with German anthropologist [[Adolf Bastian]]'s theory of the "psychic unity of mankind," which, influenced by Herder and von Humboldt, challenged the identification of "culture" with the way of life of European elites, and British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s attempt to define culture as inclusively as possible.  Tylor in 1874 described culture in the following way: "Culture or [[civilization]], taken in its wide [[ethnographic]] sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. 1874. ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tylor was not aiming to propose a general theory of culture (he explained his understanding of culture in the course of a larger argument about the nature of religion), American anthropologists have generally presented their various definitions of culture as refinements of Tylor's.  Franz Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] (1876–1970) identified culture with the "superorganic," that is, a domain with ordering principles and laws that could not be explained by or reduced to biology.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Kroeber 1917 "The Superorganic" ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 19, No. 2 pp. 163–213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Gerald Weiss reviewed various definitions of culture and debates as to their parsimony and power, and proposed as the most scientifically useful definition that "culture" be defined "''as our generic term for all human nongenetic, or metabiological, phenomena''" (italics in the original).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weiss 1973 "A Scientific Concept of Culture" in ''American Anthropologist'' 75(5): 1382&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruth Benedict]] was instrumental in establishing the modern conception of distinct cultures being patterned. 1937]]

[[Franz Boas]] founded modern American anthropology with the establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896.  At the time the dominant model of culture was that of [[cultural evolution]], which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and [[Iroquois kinship]] terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and [[Eskimo kinship]] terminology.  One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, that it was impossible to develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of [[cultural relativism]] and trained students to conduct rigorous [[participant observation]] field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]].  Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying "culture" as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural "types" or "forms" are always in a state of flux.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1920] "The Methods of Ethnology", in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  253&lt;/ref&gt; His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred L., 1948, ''Anthropology: Race, Language, Culture, Psychology, Prehistory'' revised edition.  New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, Inc. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Boas's students dominated [[cultural anthropology]] through World War II, and continued to have great influence through the 1960s.  They were especially interested in two phenomena: the great variety of forms culture took around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1907 "Anthropology" in ''A Franz Boas Reader: The Shaping of American Anthropology 1883–1911'' ed.

New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth.

Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead 1928 ''Coming of Age in Samoa''&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to their research was the concept of "context": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures.  Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing [[cultural universal]]s or universal theories of culture.

There is a tension in cultural anthropology between the claim that culture is a universal (the fact that all human societies have culture), and that it is also particular (culture takes a tremendous variety of forms around the world). Since Boas, two debates have dominated cultural anthropology. The first has to do with ways of modeling particular cultures. Specifically, anthropologists have argued as to whether "culture" can be thought of as a bounded and integrated thing, or as a quality of a diverse collection of things, the numbers and meanings of which are in constant flux. Boas's student Ruth Benedict suggested that in any given society cultural traits may be more or less "integrated," that is, constituting a pattern of action and thought that gives purpose to people's lives, and provides them with a basis from which to evaluate new actions and thoughts, although she implies that there are various degrees of integration; indeed, she observes that some cultures fail to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boas, however, argued that complete integration is rare and that a given culture only appears to be integrated because of observer bias.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1932]  "The Aims of Anthropological Research," in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Boas, the appearance of such patterns—a national culture, for example—was the effect of a particular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Bashkow, Ira 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries" ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3): 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debate was effectively suspended in 1934 when Ruth Benedict published ''[[Patterns of Culture]]'', which has continuously been in print.  Although this book is well known for popularizing the Boasian principle of [[cultural relativism]], among anthropologists it constituted both an important summary of the discoveries of Boasians, and a decisive break from Boas's emphasis on the mobility of diverse cultural traits.  "Anthropological work has been overwhelmingly devoted to the analysis of cultural traits," she wrote "rather than to the study of cultures as articulated wholes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Polish-British social anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]], however, she argued that "The first essential, so it seems today, is to study the living culture, to know its habits of thought and the functions of its institutions" and that "the only way in which we can know the significance of the selected detail of behavior is against the background of the motives and emotions and values that are institutionalized in that culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by German historians [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Oswald Spengler]], as well as by [[gestalt psychology]], she argued that "the whole determines its parts, not only their relation but their very nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1934 ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and that "cultures, likewise, are more than the sum of their traits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She observed that "Just as each spoken language draws very selectively from an extensive, but finite, set of sounds any human mouth (free from defect) can make, she concluded that in each society people, over time and through both conscious and unconscious processes, selected from an extensive but finite set of cultural traits which then combine to form a unique and distinctive pattern."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Benedict argues

{{quote|The significance of cultural behavior is not exhausted when we have clearly understood that it is local and man-made and hugely variable.  It tends to be integrated.  A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.  Within each culture there come into being characteristic purposes not necessarily shared by other types of society.  In obedience to their purposes, each people further and further consolidates its experience, and in proportion to the urgency of these drives the heterogeneous items of behavior take more and more congruous shape.  Taken up by a well-integrated culture, the most ill-assorted acts become characteristic of its particular goals, often by the most unlikely metamorphoses.|&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Benedict felt that virtually all cultures are patterned, she argued that these patterns change over time as a consequence of human creativity, and therefore different societies around the world had distinct characters. ''Patterns of Culture'' contrasts [[Zuni people|Zuňi]], [[Dobu]] and [[Kwakiutl]] cultures as a way of highlighting different ways of being human.  Benedict observed that many Westerners felt that this view forced them to abandon their "dreams of permanence and ideality and with the individual's illusions of autonomy" and that for many, this made existence "empty."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.277&lt;/ref&gt;  She argued however that once people accepted the results of scientific research, people would "arrive then at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

This view of culture has had a tremendous impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until [[the Cold War]], when anthropologists like [[Sidney Mintz]] and [[Eric Wolf]] rejected the validity and value of approaching "each culture" as "a world in itself" and "relatively stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.271&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that, too often, this approach ignored the impact of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], and the world [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened the debate on the relationship between the universal and the particular, in the form of the relationship between the global and the local).  In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French [[structuralism]] and made American anthropologists receptive to British [[structural-functionalism]].

The second debate has been over the ability to make universal claims about all cultures.  Although Boas argued that anthropologists had yet to collect enough solid evidence from a diverse sample of societies to make any valid general or universal claims about culture, by the 1940s some felt ready. Whereas Kroeber and Benedict had argued that "culture"—which could refer to local, regional, or trans-regional scales—was in some way "patterned" or "configured," some anthropologists now felt that enough data had been collected to demonstrate that it often took highly structured forms.  The question these anthropologists debated was, were these structures statistical artifacts, or where they expressions of mental models?  This debate emerged full-fledged in 1949, with the publication of [[George Murdock]]'s ''Social Structure'', and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Les Structures Élémentaires de la Parenté''.

Opposing Boas and his students was [[Yale University|Yale]] anthropologist [[George Murdock]], who compiled the [[Human Relations Area Files]].  These files code cultural variables found in different societies, so that anthropologists can use [[statistics|statistical methods]] to study correlations among different variables.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, George, 1949 ''Social Structure'' New York: The Macmillan Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1967. ''Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1981. ''Atlas of World Cultures''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate aim of this project is to develop generalizations that apply to increasingly larger numbers of individual cultures.  Later, Murdock and [[Douglas R. White]] developed the [[standard cross-cultural sample]] as a way to refine this method.

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structuralism|structuralist anthropology]] brought together ideas of Boas (especially Boas's belief in the mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's [[Émile Durkheim]]'s focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature.  His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing members of the same society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as [[myth]]s and [[ritual]]s) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only ''not'' consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people ''are'' aware).  He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures.  He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe.  The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural "table of elements," and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude 1955 ''Tristes Tropiques'' Atheneum Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude ''[[Mythologiques I-IV]]'' (trans. John Weightman and Doreen Weightman); ''Le Cru et le cuit'' (1964), ''The Raw and the Cooked'' (1969); ''Du miel aux cendres'' (1966), ''From Honey to Ashes'' (1973); ''L'Origine des manières de table'' (1968) ''The Origin of Table Manners'' (1978); ''L'Homme nu'' (1971), ''The Naked Man'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.

Murdock's HRAF and Lévi-Strauss's structuralism provide two ambitious ways to seek the universal in the particular, and both approaches continue to appeal to different anthropologists.  However, the differences between them reveal a tension implicit in the heritage of Tylor and Bastian.  Is culture to be found in [[empiricism|empirically]] observed behaviors that may form the basis of generalizations?  Or does it consist of universal mental processes, which must be inferred and abstracted from observed behavior?  This question has driven debates among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[archeology|archeologists]] as well.

=== Structural functionalism ===

In structural functionalism, as a [[social theory]], society is viewed as "a reality of structural and cultural components or "facts" that can be investigated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=24gOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Structural%20functionalism&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Structural-functionalism] in Michael Rosenberg, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Routledge, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the 1940s the Boasian understanding of culture was challenged by that new paradigm for anthropological and social science research.  This paradigm developed independently but in parallel in both the United Kingdom and in the United States (In both cases it is ''sui generis'': it has no direct relationship to "structuralism" except that both French structuralism and Anglo-American Structural-Functionalism were all influenced by Durkheim.  It is also analogous, but unrelated to, other forms of "functionalism").  Whereas the Boasians viewed anthropology as that natural science dedicated to the study of humankind, structural functionalists viewed anthropology as one social science among many, dedicated to the study of one specific facet of humanity.  This led structural-functionalists to redefine and minimize the scope of "culture."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the United Kingdom, the creation of structural functionalism was anticipated by [[Raymond Firth]]'s (1901–2002) ''We the Tikopia'', published in 1936, and marked by the publication of ''African Political Systems'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] (1906–1983) and [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Firth 1936 ''We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia'' London Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Fortes and E.E. Evans Pritchard 1940. ''African Political Systems''. London and New York: International African Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942), and his rival, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] (1881–1955).  Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology—what they call "[[social anthropology]]"—as that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies.  According to Malinowski's theory of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], all human beings have certain biological needs, such as the need for food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce.  Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs.  In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact.  Although members of any given society may not understand the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life.&lt;ref&gt;Bronisław Malinowski 1944 ''The Scientific Theory of Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;  Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies.  Influenced by the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1952 ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''&lt;/ref&gt;  Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures.  They distinguished between "social organization" (observable social interactions) and "social structure" (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability.  In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra-somatic phenomena) they made "sociality" (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study.  (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote "I should like to invoke a taboo on the word ''culture''.")&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1957 ''A Natural Science of Society'' Glencoe: The Free Press p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, in 1946 [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) founded the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]] at [[Harvard University]].  Influenced by such European sociologists as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]], Parsons developed a theory of social action that was closer to British [[social anthropology]] than to Boas's American anthropology, and which he also called "structural functionalism."  Parson's intention was to develop a total theory of social action (why people act as they do), and to develop at Harvard an inter-disciplinary program that would direct research according to this theory.  His model explained human action as the result of four systems:
# the "behavioral system" of biological needs
# the "personality system" of an individual's characteristics affecting their functioning in the social world
# the "social system" of patterns of units of social interaction, especially social status and role
# the "cultural system" of norms and values that regulate social action symbolically

According to this theory, the second system was the proper object of study for psychologists; the third system for sociologists, and the fourth system for cultural anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons 1937, ''The Structure of Social Action''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons
1951, ''The Social System''&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Boasians considered all of these systems to be objects of study by anthropologists, and "personality" and "status and role" to be as much a part of "culture" as "norms and values," Parsons envisioned a much narrower role for anthropology and a much narrower definition of culture.

Although Boasian cultural anthropologists were interested in norms and values, among many other things, it was only with the rise of structural functionalism that people came to identify "culture" with "norms and values." Many American anthropologists rejected this view of culture (and by implication, anthropology). In 1980, anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] wrote,

{{quote|As the social sciences transformed themselves into "behavioral" science, explanations for behavior were no longer traced to culture: behavior was to be understood in terms of psychological encounters, strategies of economic choice, strivings for payoffs in games of power.  Culture, once extended to all acts and ideas employed in social life, was now relegated to the margins as "world view" or "values".|&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1980 "They Divide and Subdivide and Call it Anthropology."  ''The New York Times'' November 30:E9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, several of Talcott Parsons' students emerged as leading American anthropologists.  At the same time, many American anthropologists had a high regard for the research produced by social anthropologists in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research.

The combination of American cultural anthropology theory with British social anthropology methods has led to some confusion between the concepts of "society" and "culture." For most anthropologists, these are distinct concepts. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to a pan-human capacity and the totality of non-genetic human phenomena.  Societies are often clearly bounded; cultural traits are often mobile, and cultural boundaries, such as they are, can be typically porous, permeable, and plural.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Bashkow, 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries," ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3):445–446&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1950s, and 1960s anthropologists often worked in places where social and cultural boundaries coincided, thus obscuring the distinction.  When disjunctures between these boundaries become highly salient, for example during the period of European de-colonization of Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, or during the [[Bretton Woods system|post-Bretton Woods]] realignment of [[globalization]], however, the difference often becomes central to anthropological debates.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun 1986 ''The Social Life of Things''.

=== Symbolic versus adaptive ===

Parsons' students [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[David M. Schneider]], and Schneider's student [[Roy Wagner]], went on to important careers as cultural anthropologists and developed a school within American cultural anthropology called "symbolic anthropology," the study of the social construction and social effects of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz 1973 ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Schneider 1968 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Wagner 1980 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Dolgin, David Kemnitzer, and David Schneider, eds. ''Symbolic Anthropology: a Reader in the Study of Symbols and Meanings''&lt;/ref&gt;  Since symbolic anthropology easily complemented social anthropologists' studies of social life and social structure, many British structural-functionalists (who rejected or were uninterested in Boasian cultural anthropology) accepted the Parsonian definition of "culture" and "cultural anthropology."  British anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] (who eventually left the United Kingdom to teach in the United States) was an important bridge between American and British symbolic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner 1967 ''The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to symbols, the meaning of which depended almost entirely on their historical and social context, appealed to many Boasians. [[Leslie White]] asked of cultural things, "What sort of objects are they? Are they physical objects? Mental objects? Both? Metaphors? Symbols? Reifications?" In ''Science of Culture'' (1949), he concluded that they are objects "''[[sui generis]]''"; that is, of their own kind. In trying to define that kind, he hit upon a previously unrealized aspect of symbolization, which he called "the symbolate"—an object created by the act of symbolization. He thus defined culture as "symbolates understood in an extra-somatic context."&lt;ref&gt;White, L. 1949. ''The Science of Culture: A study of man and civilization.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by the 1930s White began turning away from the Boasian approach.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Barrett 1989, "The Paradoxical Anthropology of Leslie White,"
''American Anthropologist'' Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 986–999&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,

{{quote|In order to live man, like all other species, must come to terms with the external world.... Man employs his sense organs, nerves, glands, and muscles in adjusting himself to the external world. But in addition to this he has another means of adjustment and control.... This mechanism is ''culture''.|&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1949 "Ethnological Theory." In ''Philosophy for the Future: The Quest of Modern Materialism''. R. W. Sellars, V.J. McGill, and M. Farber, eds. Pp. 357–384. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this view echoes that of Malinowski, the key concept for White was not "function" but "adaptation."  Whereas the Boasians were interested in the history of specific traits, White was interested in the cultural history of the human species, which he felt should be studied from an evolutionary perspective.  Thus, the task of anthropology is to study "not only how culture evolves, but why as well.... In the case of man ... the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something— these are the factors of cultural evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1943 "Energy and the Evolution of Culture." ''American Anthropologist'' 45: 339&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike 19th century evolutionists, who were concerned with how civilized societies rose above primitive societies, White was interested in documenting how, over time, humankind as a whole has through cultural means discovered more and more ways for capturing and harnessing energy from the environment, in the process transforming culture.

At the same time that White was developing his theory of [[cultural evolution]], Kroeber's student [[Julian Steward]] was developing his theory of [[cultural ecology]].  In 1938, he published ''Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Socio-Political Groups'' in which he argued that diverse societies—for example the indigenous [[Shoshone]] or White farmers on the Great Plains—were not less or more evolved; rather, they had adapted to different environments in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1938 ''Basin Plateau Aboriginal Socio-political Groups'' (Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, No 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Leslie White was interested in culture understood holistically as a property of the human species, Julian Steward was interested in culture as the property of distinct societies.  Like White he viewed culture as a means of adapting to the environment, but he criticized Whites "unilineal" (one direction) theory of cultural evolution and instead proposed a model of "multilineal" evolution in which (in the Boasian tradition) each society has its own cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

When Julian Steward left a teaching position at the University of Michigan to work in Utah in 1930, Leslie White took his place; in 1946 Julian Steward was made Chair of the Columbia University Anthropology Department.  In the 1940s and 1950s their students, most notably [[Marvin Harris]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Elman Service]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]] and [[Eric Wolf]] dominated American anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1979 ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1977 ''Cannibals and Kings: Origins of Cultures'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1974 ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy A. Rappaport 1967 ''Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward, ed. 1966 ''The people of Puerto Rico: a study in social anthropology''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press (includes doctoral dissertations of Mintz and Wolf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Murphy 1960 ''Headhunter's Heritage; Social and Economic Change Among the Mundurucu Indians''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service, ''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elman R. Service 1962 ''Primitive social organization: an evolutionary perspective'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Peter Vayda, ed. 1969 ''Environment and cultural behavior: ecological studies in cultural anthropology'' Garden City: Natural History Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Most promoted materialist understandings of culture in opposition to the symbolic approaches of Geertz and Schneider.  Harris, Rappaport, and Vayda were especially important for their contributions to [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and [[ecological anthropology]], both of which argued that "culture" constituted an extra-somatic (or non-biological) means through which human beings could adapt to life in drastically differing physical environments.

The debate between symbolic and materialist approaches to culture dominated American anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s.  The [[Vietnam War]] and the publication of [[Dell Hymes]]' ''Reinventing Anthropology'', however, marked a growing dissatisfaction with the then dominant approaches to culture.  Hymes argued that fundamental elements of the Boasian project such as holism and an interest in diversity were still worth pursuing: "interest in other peoples and their ways of life, and concern to explain them within a frame of reference that includes ourselves."{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=11}}  Moreover, he argued that cultural anthropologists are singularly well-equipped to lead this study (with an indirect rebuke to sociologists like Parsons who sought to subsume anthropology to their own project):

{{quote|In the practice there is a traditional place for openness to phenomena in ways not predefined by theory or design&amp;nbsp;– attentiveness to complex phenomena, to phenomena of interest, perhaps aesthetic, for their own sake, to the sensory as well as intellectual, aspects of the subject.  These comparative and practical perspectives, though not unique to formal anthropology, are specially husbanded there, and might well be impaired, if the study of man were to be united under the guidance of others who lose touch with experience in concern for methodology, who forget the ends of social knowledge in elaborating its means, or who are unwittingly or unconcernedly culture-bound.|{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=42}}}}

It is these elements, Hymes argued, that justify a "general study of man," that is, "anthropology".{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=43}}

During this time notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf eventually broke away; experimenting with [[Structuralism|structuralist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] approaches to culture, they continued to promote cultural anthropology against structural functionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Mintz 1985 ''Sweetness and Power'' New York: Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Murphy 1971 ''The Dialectics of Social Life'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins 1976 ''Culture and Practical Reason''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1971 ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf, 1982 ''Europe and the People Without History'' Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local versus global ===

[[File:Taiwanese aborigines.JPG|thumb|[[Taiwanese aborigines]] dancing]]

Boas and Malinowski established ethnographic research as a highly localized method for studying culture.  Yet Boas emphasized that culture is dynamic, moving from one group of people to another, and that specific cultural forms have to be analyzed in a larger context.  This has led anthropologists to explore different ways of understanding the global dimensions of culture.

In the 1940s and 1950s, several key studies focused on how trade between indigenous peoples and the Europeans who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change in the organization of labor, or change in critical technologies. [[Bernard Mishkin]] studied the effect of the introduction of horses on [[Kiowa]] political organization and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkin, Bernard 1940 ''Rank and Warfare in Plains Indian Culture.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 3.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Lewis]] explored the influence of the fur trade on [[Blackfoot Indians|Blackfoot]] culture (relying heavily on historical sources).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Oscar 1942  ''The Effects of White Contact upon Blackfoot Culture, with Special Reference to the Role of the Fur Trade.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 6.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jablow]] documented how [[Cheyenne]] social organization and subsistence strategy between 1795 and 1840 were determined by their position in trade networks linking Whites and other Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Jablow, Joseph 1951 ''The Cheyenne in Plains Indian Trade Relations, 1795–1972.''  American Ethnological Society Monograph 19.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Secoy]] argued that [[Great Plains]] Indians' social organization and military tactics changed as horses, introduced by the Spanish in the south, diffused north, and guns, introduced by the British and French in the east, diffused west.&lt;ref&gt;Secoy, Frank 1953  ''Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains (17th Century through Early 19th Century).'' American Ethnological Society Monograph 21, New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mexico.Mor.Tepoztlan.01.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[El Tepozteco|Tepozteco]] mountain dominates views from Tepoztlán.]]
In the 1950s, [[Robert Redfield]] and students of [[Julian Steward]] pioneered "community studies," namely, the study of distinct communities (whether identified by race, ethnicity, or economic class) in Western or "Westernized" societies, especially cities.  They thus encountered the antagonisms 19th century critics described using the terms "high culture" and "low culture."  These 20th-century anthropologists struggled to describe people who were politically and economically inferior but not, they believed, culturally inferior. [[Oscar Lewis]] proposed the concept of a "culture of poverty" to describe the cultural mechanisms through which people adapted to a life of economic poverty.  Other anthropologists and sociologists began using the term "sub-culture" to describe culturally distinct communities that were part of larger societies.

One important kind of subculture is that formed by an immigrant community.  In dealing with immigrant groups and their cultures, there are various approaches:
* [[Leitkultur]] (core culture): A model developed in Germany by [[Bassam Tibi]]. The idea is that minorities can have an identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.
* [[Melting pot]]: In the [[United States]], the traditional view has been one of a melting pot where all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.
* [[Monoculturalism]]: In some European states, culture is very closely linked to [[nationalism]], thus government policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.
* [[Multiculturalism]]: A policy that immigrants and others should preserve their cultures with the different cultures interacting peacefully within one nation.

The way nation states treat immigrant cultures rarely falls neatly into one or another of the above approaches.  The degree of difference with the host culture (i.e., "foreignness"), the number of immigrants, attitudes of the resident population, the type of government policies that are enacted, and the effectiveness of those policies all make it difficult to generalize about the effects. Similarly with other subcultures within a society, attitudes of the mainstream population and communications between various cultural groups play a major role in determining outcomes.  The study of cultures within a society is complex and research must take into account a myriad of variables.

'''Anti-monumentalism''' (or '''Counter-monumentalism''') is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=counter-monuments |url=http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415170228/http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]],  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."&lt;ref name="ISBN 90-5662-236-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano-Hemmer|first=Rafael|title=Alien Relationships with Public Space|journal=TransUrbanism|year=2002|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]]'s ''Bunker Hill Monument Projections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh Mahan |first=Nicole |title=Krzysztof Wodiczko;s "If You See Something...": counter-memory and the role of the artist in Post-9/11 America |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414231038/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Do-Ho Suh]]'s ''Public Figures'' can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Do-Ho|title=The Anti-Monument|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.10-detail-korean-artist/|publisher=The Walrus|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenians in Bangladesh''' are ethnic [[Armenians]] who lived in what is now called [[Bangladesh]]. Their numbers have diminished significantly, but there is a notable presence in the country, particularly in [[Dhaka]].
 
There was a fairly large Armenian colony in Dhaka during the early part of the 18th century, most of whom were engaged in the [[jute]] trade.  Prominent Armenian jute merchants had their own companies, like Messrs Sarkies &amp; Sons, Messrs David &amp; Co., etc. Gradually, the jute business was monopolised by the more powerful and better-organised British firms. The early Armenian settlers built a small chapel in the midst of their community graveyard. By the end of the 18th century, the Armenian community had grown considerably, and the chapel was found inadequate for the needs of the community, so it was replaced by the Holy Resurrection Church. The church was completed in 1781 and consecrated by Bishop Ephreim. A [[Bell tower|belfry]] was added in 1837. In 1910 a [[parsonage]] was added and the floor of the church was decorated with marble, and electric lights.

The Armenian Apostolic Church of Holy Resurrection of Dhaka still remains today.

==Armenian community of Dhaka==
{{Main article|Armenian community of Dhaka}}
The Armenian community of [[Dhaka]] played a significant role in Bengali trade and commerce in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the early part of 18th Century, Armenians settled in Dhaka, then one of the commercial centres in [[Bengal]]. They initially built a chapel and cemetery at [[Tejgaon]], five miles from Dhaka. The oldest tombstone is “Avetis” an Armenian merchant who died on 15 August 1714. Apart from Dhaka there was a significant Armenian presence in Saidabad (a suburb of the capital [[Murshidabad]]), [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hoogli]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chinsura]], [[Patna]] and [[Kasimbazar]]. A neighborhood in Dhaka, [[Armanitola]], bears their name; there is the Church of the Holy Resurrection and the cemetery established by the community in 1781 standing as major landmarks. Their assertive presence, however, began to decline from the beginning of British rule.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Michael Joseph Martin (Mikel Housep Martirossian) is reported to have been the last Armenian in Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawson |first=Alastair |date=10 January 2003 |title=The mission of Dhaka's last Armenian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2645617.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aztec philosophy''' was a school of [[philosophy]] that developed out of [[Aztec|Aztec culture]]. The Aztecs had a well-developed school of philosophy, perhaps the most developed in the [[Americas]] and in many ways comparable to [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], even amassing more texts than the  ancient Greeks.&lt;ref name="Mann1491"&gt;Mann, Charles C. ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005. p, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aztec philosophy focused on [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]], [[monism]], and [[aesthetics]], and Aztec philosophers attempted to answer the main Aztec philosophical question of how to gain stability and balance in an [[ephemeral]] world.

== Beliefs ==
Aztec philosophy saw the concept of ''[[Ometeotl]]'' as a  unity that underlies the universe.  Ometeotl forms, shapes, and is all things.  Even things in opposition—light and dark, life and death—were seen as expressions of the same unity, Ometeotl.  The belief in a unity with dualistic expressions compares with similar [[dialectical monism|dialectical monist]] ideas in both Western and Eastern philosophies.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Maffie|title=Aztec Philosophy|work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date= 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aztec.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to Aztec religion ==
Aztec priests had a [[panentheistic]] view of religion but the popular [[Aztec religion]] maintained [[polytheism]].  Priests saw the different gods as aspects of the singular and transcendent unity of [[Teotl]] but the masses were allowed to practice polytheism without understanding the true, unified nature of their Aztec gods.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"/&gt;

== Moral beliefs and aesthetics ==
Aztec philosophers focused on morality as establishing balance.  The world was seen as constantly shifting with the ever-changing teotl.  Morality focused on finding the path to living a balanced life, which would provide stability in the shifting world.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"/&gt;

Aztec philosophy saw the arts as a way to express the true nature of teotl.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"/&gt;  Art was considered to be good if it in some way brought about a better understanding of teotl.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"/&gt;  [[Aztec#Arts|Aztec poetry]] was closely tied to philosophy and often used to express philosophic concepts.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann1491_poetry"&gt;Mann, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Below is an example of such a poem, translated from the original [[Nahuatl]]:

''No one comes on this earth to stay''&lt;br&gt;
''Our bodies are like rose trees - ''&lt;br&gt;
''They grow petals then wither and die.''&lt;br&gt;
''But our hearts are like grass in the springtime,''&lt;br&gt;
''They live on and forever grow green again.&lt;br&gt;''

==Texts==
There is a dearth of material from which Aztec philosophy can be studied with a majority of extant texts written after conquest by either Spanish colonists and missionaries, or [[Christianization|Christianised]] Spanish educated natives. Pre-conquest sources include the [[Codex Borgia]] and the [[Codex Borbonicus ]] (written about the time of conquest). Post-conquest texts include the [[Florentine Codex]], [[Codex Mendoza]] and the [[Codex Magliabechiano]], including others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/|title=Aztec Philosophy - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}
The '''Balinese caste system''' is a system of social organization similar to the [[Indian caste system]].

The four castes of Bali are:
*Soedra [[Shudra]]s – [[peasant]]s making up more than 90% of Bali's population. They constitute close to 93% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=8bW8WB-GrOYC&amp;pg=PA53&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wesias ([[Vaishya]]s) – the caste of merchants and administrative officials
*Satrias [[Balinese Kshatriya|Ksatrias]] ([[Kshatriya]]s) – the [[warrior]] caste, it also included some nobility and [[monarch|kings]]
*Brahmana [[Brahmin]]s – holy men and [[priest]]s

Note the similarity of the castes to the four ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]]'' ''(shudra, vaishya, kshatriya, brahmin)'' of India.

Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a "very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Lewis|author2=Belinda Lewis|title=Bali's silent crisis: desire, tragedy, and transition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yuNMcfJHeyUC |year= 2009|publisher= Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3243-2|pages=56, 83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four castes have been classified as Soedra ([[Shudra]]), Wesia ([[Vaishya]]s), [[Balinese Kshatriya|Satrias]] ([[Kshatriya]]s) and Brahmana ([[Brahmin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Geoffrey Robinson|title= The Dark Side of Paradise: Political Violence in Bali|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C |year=1995| publisher= Cornell University Press|isbn= 0-8014-8172-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that Balinese caste had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the "received understandings concerning its Indian origins".&lt;ref name="Creese2016p305"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen M. Creese|title=Bali in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQpRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA305 |year=2016|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-31583-9|pages=305 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelled ''Soedra'') have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes.&lt;ref name=belo4/&gt; 

In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite ''meweda'' (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.&lt;ref name=belo4&gt;Jane Belo (1953), Bali: Temple Festival, Monograph 22, American Ethnological Society, University of Washington Press, pages 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the four castes use different levels of the [[Balinese language]] to address members of a different caste.  Middle Balinese is generally used to speak to people whose caste is unknown in an encounter.  Once the caste status of the participants are established, the proper language is used to address each other.

Nowadays, the caste system is used more in religious settings where the members of the lower caste would ask the members of the Brahman caste (the Pedandas) to conduct ceremonies. Since the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial years]] and more recently after the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian independence]], the differences in the economic roles of the members of the caste system are slowly eroding as the government prohibits treatments based on the caste system.

Most of the Kshatriya families in Java and Bali became extinct during the fall of the [[Majapahit]] and the numerous Javanese wars. Almost all of the Balinese Kshatriyas trace their origin to the royal family of King [[Dewa Agung|Deva Agung]], who ruled 500 years before. Some of the original Kshatriyas, like those claiming descent from Arya Damar were relegated to Wesia status, so only those claiming descent from Deva Agung are recognized as proper Kshatriya in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GcAAANXuMVwC&amp;pg=PA159&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s there were conflicts between supporters of the traditional caste system in Bali and its opponents. Many of the latter were affiliated with the PKI, the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]], which was violently oppressed during the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Adrian (1995), From Oey, Eric (Editor) (1995).

The '''Banat Swabians''' are an [[ethnic German]] population in [[Southeast Europe]], part of the [[Danube Swabians]].

They emigrated in the 18th century to what was then the Austrian Empire's [[Banat of Temeswar]] province, later included in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]], a province which had been left sparsely populated by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars with Turkey]]. At the end of World War I in 1918, the Swabian minority worked to establish an independent multi-ethnic [[Banat Republic]]; however, the province was divided by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920. The greater part was annexed by [[Romania]], a smaller part by former [[Yugoslavia]], and a small region around [[Szeged]] remained part of [[Hungary]].

Following [[World War II]] most Banat Swabians were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled to the West]] by the Soviet Union and its subsidiaries, and after 1990 and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] and its republics many of those remaining left for economic and emotional reasons.

==Banat and the Danube Swabians==
The Banat colonists are often grouped with other German-speaking ethnic groups in the area under the name ''[[Danube Swabians]]''. Besides the Banat, these groups lived in nearby western [[Bačka]] in [[Vojvodina]], Serbia, in [[Swabian Turkey]] (present-day southern Hungary), in [[Slavonia]], (present-day Croatia), and in [[Satu Mare]], Romania. All of these areas were under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule, when the Crown recruited German immigrants, particularly farmers. It wanted to repopulate the lands newly recovered from Turkish occupation and to revive agriculture in an area that had been frequently overrun by war.

==Origins and recruitment==
[[Image:deutschsieben bürgen.svg|thumb|right|250px|Traditionally German (Saxon or Swabian) territories in Banat and Transylvania]]
Immigrants were encouraged to settle in the Banat by the Austrian emperors in the 18th century to repopulate a frontier province bordering the Turkish empire, and to add an ethnic European Christians to the population of the newly occupied region. The Germans were offered free land and the privilege of keeping their language and religion. The Crown was seeking [[Roman Catholic]] immigrants, as were the Italian and the Spanish colonists who had come to the region.&lt;ref name="feefhs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feefhs.org/BANAT/BHISTORY.HTML |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970204103909/http://www.feefhs.org/banat/bhistory.html |archivedate=4 February 1997 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the German settlers came from [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Franconia]], and the [[Palatinate region|Palatinate]]. A small group can be traced to [[Middle Germany]]. However, comparatively few came from the [[Swabia]]n regions of what was then known as [[Further Austria]]. It is unclear how the group came to be called the Banat ''Swabians'', but it is probably because the majority registered and embarked from the Swabian city of [[Ulm]]. They were transported on the ''Ulmer Schachteln'' (barges) down the [[Danube]] to [[Budapest]] or [[Belgrade]], whence they set off on foot for their new homes.

The colonists were generally the younger sons of poor farming families, who saw little chance of success at home. Under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], they received financial support and long-term tax relief. Many of the earliest immigrants never married, since few German women traveled among them. Craftsmen were financially encouraged, as were teachers, doctors, and other professionals. Over the decades and more, the German spoken by these colonists became separate from that developing in Germany, particularly after its unification. It became known as Donau-Swabian, an archaic form of the language.

Those who came from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] maintained the French language (labelled Banat French or ''Français du Banat''), as well as a separate ethnic identity for several generations.&lt;ref name="memoria.ro"&gt;[http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;id=1641&amp;l=fr Smaranda Vultur, De l’Ouest à l’Est et de l’Est à l’Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Français du Banat, Texte presenté a la conférence d'histoire orale "Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines", Paris, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with 1893, because of the [[Magyarisation]] policies of the nationalistic Hungarian State, some Banat Swabians began to move to [[Bulgaria]], where they settled in the village of [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Vratsa Province]], founded earlier by [[Banat Bulgarians]]. Their number eventually exceeded 90 families. In 1929 they built a separate Roman Catholic church after disagreements with Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these German-speaking families later moved to [[Tsarev Brod]], [[Shumen Province]] along with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families who went to another Banat Bulgarian village, [[Gostilya]], [[Pleven Province]].

Between 1941 and 1943, 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were relocated to Germany as part of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.

==Banat Swabians 1920-1944==
[[Image:Banatia.png|thumb|250px|Republic of Banatia, proposed by Banatian Swabians at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1920]]
The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian rule and its replacement by Romanian rule over the Banat after World War I had some benefits. In the late 19th century, Hungary had undergone a period of rapid [[Magyarization]], during which it attempted to assimilate all of its minorities. Schools were required to teach only in the Hungarian language.

Under Romanian rule, Banat Swabians could have German-language schools again for the first time since 1868. Banat Swabian culture flourished.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Johann Böhm (historian)]], ''Die Deutschen in Rumänien und die Weimarer Republik 1919-1933,'' (Ippesheim 1993) {{ISBN|3-928389-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German-language theatre operated in [[Timişoara]], and across Banat, German-language newspapers were established. In 1921 a cultural association called the "Verband der Deutschen in Rumaenien" (Union of Germans in Romania) was founded.&lt;ref name="feefhs.org"/&gt;

Economically, however, things did not go well. The Crash of the Stock Market on [[Black Friday (1929)|Black Friday]] and the subsequent financial crises of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s hit the Banat hard. Many Swabians left to work in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United States]], never to return.

After 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] gained some influence among the [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] of [[Eastern Europe]], including the Banat Swabians. During the [[Second World War]], many ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Romanian Army and served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. After 1943, a German-Romanian treaty allowed them to serve instead in the [[Wehrmacht]], without having to give up their Romanian citizenship. Initially, some were virtually forced to serve in the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]], fearing there would be sanctions against their families if they refused. After August 1941 Nazi German instituted involuntary conscription of Banat Swabians into the [[SS]]. Towards the end of the war, some Banat Swabians openly opposed the Nazis, who in retaliation publicly executed a group of them in [[Jimbolia]] ([[Jimbolia|Hatzfeld]]).

Banat Swabians who served in the Prinz Eugen Division gained notoriety because of the division's war crimes against Jews and Serbs during the [[Banat (1941–1944)]] period. They became alienated and were distrusted by their non-Banat Swabian neighbors. This was one of the reasons [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s Yugoslavia decided to incarcerate and starve to death all Banat Swabians who lived in [[Yugoslavia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Life after 1944==

===Romania===
The [[Kingdom of Romania]], formerly Nazi Germany's ally, joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 23 August 1944. Overnight, all Banat Swabians in Romania became regarded as potential enemies of the state. The approach of the [[Red Army]] caused a flood of refugees to flee to the safety of Hitler's Germany.

By January 1945, Romania was completely under Soviet control. Early in 1945, under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s orders, many Banat Swabians were expelled or [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II|deported]] to forced labor camps in the [[Soviet Union]], where thousands of them died. Those who remained had their land confiscated and lost ownership of their homes (partially returned during the 1950s), while those who fled also lost their citizenship. In 1951 more than a thousand Banat Swabians were [[Bărăgan deportations|displaced]] to the [[Bărăgan Plain|Bărăgan Steppe]] of southeast Romania, where they founded new villages. Almost all were finally allowed to return home in 1956, but some were kept interned by force until 1963.

Some Swabian families from both Romanian and [[Yugoslavia]]n Banat managed to flee to Germany in the immediate postwar years. Others were helped by French Prime Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to settle in France as ''Français du Banat''.&lt;ref name="memoria.ro"/&gt;

In the 1960s, however, the political atmosphere relaxed. The policy of disfranchising and dispossessing alleged Nazi collaborators within the German-speaking minority ended. Banat Swabians were extended the full rights of Romanian citizenship. Nevertheless, many Banat Swabians chose to use the looser conditions to emigrate to Germany, since they no longer trusted Romania's communist government's promises. The [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who had lived in the region since the Middle Ages, made a similar decision. Even though the Swabian families of the Danube and Banat Swabians had lived there for ten generations or more, and their cultures had developed quite differently from Germany's, they no longer felt safe.

In 1965, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] came to power in Romania. At first he opened the country to the West, but by the end of the 1970s, he had become ultra-nationalistic and an opponent of all ethnic minorities. Under his rule, any Banat Swabian who chose to emigrate had to pay a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of more than a thousand [[German mark|mark]]s (depending on age and education) for a permanent emigration visa. Still, thousands of Banat Swabians left each year into the 1980s. An economic crisis of the communist state, as well as a rumor concerning a village destruction project, caused some 200,000 to flee Romania.&lt;ref name="feefhs.org"/&gt;

After Ceaușescu's fall in 1989 and [[German Reunification]] in 1990, almost all the remaining Banat Germans in [[Romania]] left for [[Germany]]. As a consequence, the ethnic German population in Romania is greatly reduced. Some are returning, generally entrepreneurs with economic ambitions supported by the German non-returnable grants for development projects outside Germany. Some former Banat Swabians now have a renewed desire to return to their long-time home, but most had to sell their property when they left and have no home to return to.

Of the 750,000 ethnic Germans who once lived in Romania, less than one-tenth of that number remain today. Only in cities with large populations is there still a functioning German cultural life, usually aided by uninterrupted Romanian State subsidies and help from ethnic Romanians. Still, the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung'' is a thriving weekly paper, and the German State Theater in [[Timişoara]] (''Deutsches Staatstheater Temeswar''), subsidized by the Romanian government, produces permanent theatre shows. In [[Timişoara]] and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], there are German-language primary and secondary schools, attended mostly by Romanian students. The remaining ethnic Germans (including Banat Swabians) in Romania are represented in politics by the DFDR or ''Demokratisches Forum der Deutschen in Rumänien'' ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]]).

===Yugoslavia===
While the Swabians from other areas of Yugoslavia escaped or were expelled, the destiny of Banat and Bačka Swabians was much less fortunate. Due to the high level of military conscription, mostly women, children and elderly people remained in the villages, and they were unwilling or unable to flee. Near the end of the war, all Swabians who were suspected of having been involved with the Nazi military administration were placed in provisional internment camps. Many were tortured, and at least 5,800 were killed. Others were used as forced labor. After Christmas in 1944, about 30,000 younger people, mostly women, were transferred to labor camps in the Soviet Union by train, escorted by communist partisans.&lt;ref name=hec04/&gt;

In the framework of agricultural reform, partisan families - mainly migrants from war-torn [[Bosnia]], [[Lika]] and [[Montenegro]]— took over the confiscated Swabian farms and houses. In March 1945, the surviving Swabians were [[ghetto]]ized in "village camps", later described as "extermination camps" by the survivors, where the death rate ranged as high as 50%.&lt;ref name=hec04&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|title=The Expulsion of the German-Speaking Minority from Yugoslavia|author1=Sretenovic, Stanislav|author2=Prauser, Steffen|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=European University Institute, Florence|page=55|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100309/http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notorious camp was at [[Knićanin]] (formerly Rudolfsgnad), where an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 Swabians died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |title=Vojvodina Germans Seek Moral and Cultural Rehabilitation |publisher=Beta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520012559/http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation improved in 1947, when foreign humanitarian aid reached the camps, and their work routines were loosened. The camp system was closed in March 1948, with the surviving inmates being conscripted for forced labor in the army or industry. Their flight also was usually tolerated. By the end of the 1950s, about 300,000 Yugoslav Swabians had managed to emigrate to Western countries, including the United States.&lt;ref name=hec04/&gt;

According to a study conducted in 1961 by the German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], later supported by German emigrant organizations, at least 7,200 Swabians were executed by the Partisans, about 2,000 deported to the Soviet Union, and roughly 48,000 died in labor camps. About 16.8% of the Swabians in Yugoslavia died during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|title=The Expulsion of the German-Speaking Minority from Yugoslavia|author1=Sretenovic, Stanislav|author2=Prauser, Steffen|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=European University Institute, Florence|page=56|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100309/http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demographic history of Serbia|Serbian census from 2002]] records only 3,901 [[Germans in Serbia]], 3,154 of whom were in the province of [[Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danas.rs/vesti/drustvo/terazije/zajednica_brojnija_nego_sto_pokazuje_popis.14.html?news_id=121145|title=Zajednica brojnija nego što pokazuje popis|author=Laloš, Vesela|publisher=Danas|date=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2007/03/27/srpski/V07032601.shtml|title=Nemci osnivaju nacionalni savet|publisher=Glas Javnosti|date=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007 the remaining Swabians formed their own minority council in [[Novi Sad]], having gained the required 3,000 voter signatures. The president, Andreas Biegermeier, stated the council would focus on property restitution, as well as marking mass graves and camp sites. He estimated the total number of remaining Danube Swabians in Serbia and their descendants as between 5,000 and 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradjanski.rs/navigacija.php?vest=13601|title=Nemci traže da im država vrati oduzetu imovinu|publisher=Građanski List|date=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]] fewer than 62,000 Danube Swabians remain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas.hu/eng/volumes/24/tables/load1_4_1.html Hungarian census by ethnic groups, 2001] The category "Germans" includes mostly, but not only, the Danube Swabians&lt;/ref&gt; but they do have political representation. One city and several villages have German-speaking mayors {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Expulsion of the Swabian minority from Hungary by the communist government, dictated by Soviet Union, took place between 1945 and 1948. As a result, many have assimilated and changed their ethnicity to become [[Magyars]] as well in Hungary as former Yugoslavia and Romania.

==Swabians in emigration==
The Banat Swabians who emigrated to Germany are generally well integrated into the society in which they live. They keep contact through cultural organisations (''Landsmannschaften''). In [[Vienna]] and in southern Germany, where most Banat Swabians now live, some maintain their customs and dialect, and offer support to those who remain in Romania.

Banat Swabians in the United States, whose ancestors emigrated beginning in the 1950s, have also formed community associations, including one in the New York metropolitan area&lt;ref&gt;http://donauschwaben-usa.org/new_york_donauschwaben.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, one in the Detroit area&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carpathiaclub.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, and one in the Cincinnati area&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cincydonau.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Beti''' is a group of [[Bantu language]]s, spoken by the [[Beti-Pahuin]] peoples who inhabit the [[rain forest]] regions of [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id%3Dbtb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911151604/http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=btb |archivedate=2011-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties, which are largely [[mutually intelligible]] and variously considered dialects or closely related languages, are:
:[[Ewondo language|Ewondo]] (Yaunde)
:[[Fang language|Fang]]
:[[Bulu language|Bulu]]
:[[Eton language|Eton]]
:[[Bebele language|Bebele]]
:[[Bebil language|Bebil]]
:[[Mengisa language|Mengisa]].

Beti had an ISO 639-3 code, but this was retired in 2010 because the varieties of Beti already had their own codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id%3D2009-032 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016214510/http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2009-032 |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Beti-based pidgin called [[Ewondo Populaire]].

Capital punishment in [[Aruba]] has been prohibited by Article I.4 of the [[Constitution of Aruba]] since January 1, 1986, the day Aruba became a constituent country of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in its own right. The inclusion of a capital punishment prohibition in the constitution was following the example provided by the 1983 [[constitution of the Netherlands]], but rather than putting it in the judiciary section like the example, it was put in the basic rights, following the related Article I.3 about the inviolability of the body, to ensure that the prohibition would not be perceived as exclusively applying to judges.

The '''Chennai Trekking Club''' (CTC) is a [[Volunteering|voluntary]] [[nonprofit organization]] whose members meet weekly for [[outdoor recreation]], [[environmental education]] and  [[social responsibility]] activities. The [[Club (organization)|club]] was established on 22 February 2008 by a small group of [[trekking]] enthusiasts in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. It started as an informal group of several friends in the computer industry and quickly grew into a 10,000+ member organization that primarily facilitates trekking as an organized sport.

CTC mainly organizes 2-3 day weekend treks in and around [[South India]]. It also organizes related activities such as short treks for [[disadvantaged]] people and walks for [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[nature photography]] tours, one day [[Hiking|hike]]s and workshops on navigation using [[GPS]], photography, [[first aid]] and [[survival skills]]. CTC has organized more than 300 treks and more than 500 new members join each month.&lt;ref name="CTC"/&gt;

==History==

[[File:Ombattu Gudda Peak-2009-11.jpg|thumb|295px|30 CTC trekkers atop 971 m. Ombattu Gudda Peak in Kabbinhole Reserved Forest, Karnataka, 15 November 2009]]
The Chennai Trekking Club (CTC) was started by a few trekking enthusiasts from [[CISCO]], [[Thoraipakkam]], Chennai a few years ago. In February 2008, after completing around 10 treks throughout South India this small group published their adventures and photos online in their blog, and allowed new people to join their group. After that, many people found them by word of mouth or on Google and joined the club. There is no membership fee. Three years later they have 10,000+ members in the club, with over 6,000 active members who have participated in at least one trek. On average over 15 new members join every day. CTC has completed over 300 treks throughout India.&lt;ref name="CTC"/&gt;

Several trekking destinations undertaken by the club include: [[Sigur Plateau#Culture|Anaikatti]], [[Barapalli]], [[Charbadi|Charmadi Ghat]], [[Chembra Peak]], [[Coorg]], [[Pune Forts]], [[Javadi Hills]], [[Kalrayan Hills]], [[Kolli Hills]], [[Kondavid Fort|Kondaveedu Fort]], [[Nagalapuram]], [[Nagari]], [http://usandeep.com/trekking/ombattugudda.html Ombattu Gudde], [[Ootacamund]], [[Palani Hills]], [http://arunachalagrace.blogspot.com/2007/01/parvathamalai-hill.html Parvadhamalai], [[Pulicat]], [[Roopkund]], [[Sakleshpur]], [[Savandurga]], [[Skandagiri]], [[Tada, Nellore district|Tada]], [http://trekwiki.wetpaint.com/page/Tadiyandamol Tadiyandamol], [http://codingmythoughts.blogspot.com/2009/03/tadikalapudi-trek.html Tadkalpudipeak], [[Talakona]], [[Tirumala]], [[Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park|Top Slip]], [http://usandeep.com/trekking/vavulmala.html Vavulmala], [[Vellarimala]], [[Venkatagiri]], [[Venkateshwara]], [[Wayanad]], [[Yelagiri]], [[Yercaud]]&lt;ref name="treks"/&gt;

For their 2nd anniversary celebration on 20–21 February 2010, CTC organized 14 simultaneous treks for 444 members. For their 3rd anniversary celebration on 19–20 February 2011, CTC organized 14 simultaneous treks for 427 members.&lt;ref name="treks"&gt;

==Activities==
CTC organizes member-led treks during weekends, and travels through mountains and wilderness areas in the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Western Ghats]]. Occasionally, long treks are organized in the [[Himalayas]]. CTC's growth is attributed to a large fan base, mainly in South India, and to the volunteers who spend many hours researching and organizing the treks. It also has members from outside India, mainly [[expatriates]] who live or lived in Chennai and [[Bangalore]] and became part of CTC. In addition to providing a nice break from urban and corporate life, activities organized by CTC stimulate awareness of environmental issues and encourages physical fitness among its members. Chennai Trekking Club organizes periodic photography trips and treks especially for those members who are interested in Natural and Wildlife photography. Photography workshops for members are also conducted by experienced wildlife photographers.In addition to all these things CTC organizes Social Treks with unprivileged kids, Tree Plantation &amp; Maintenance activities, Lake cleanup, Beach cleanup.CTC also organises yearly Trail Marathons and trained hundreds of aspiring runners.&lt;ref name="CTC"&gt;

Several core members volunteer weeks in advance to plan and organize each trek. CTC leaders are known as ''pathfinders''. They often do not follow existing trails but trek through unexplored jungles and mountains creating their own trail using [[topographic map]]s, [[compass]] and GPS (satellite guided navigation).&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

The leaders and volunteers of CTC organize treks every weekend. Sometimes there may be 3-4 simultaneous treks on any given weekend. Treks are planned to forests &amp; wilderness both nearby Chennai as well as further away in the [[Eastern Ghats]] and [[Western Ghats]] in Tamil Nadu, [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and occasionally, [[North India]]. Levels of treks goes from easy to intermediate to difficult. The number of participants for a trek varies typically between 10 and 40.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;

In addition to the regular treks, CTC organizes a variety of other events. Periodically they organize social outings for underprivileged groups in the Chennai area, including: orphans, street children lost or run away from home, destitute women, downs Syndrome kids, AIDS victims and other disadvantaged groups. CTC periodically organizes educational workshops like first aid and survival skills training, training on maps and navigation, photography workshops, climbing events and snake workshops. They also organize ladies treks, senior treks, couples treks and family treks. They periodically organize long distance multiday [[motorcycling]] trips over mountain roads and [[trail riding]] through scenic locations.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

CTC has programs to keep the forests clean - in addition to their no-pollution guidelines, periodic cleanup events are organized to clean up polluted natural locations. On 1 November 2009, 200+ members of CTC organized a mega cleanup trek to [[Tada, Nellore district|Tada]] which had become very polluted and abused over the past several years. On 9 January 2011, over 800 volunteer members collected 800 bags of garbage from {{convert|15|km}} of the beaches of Chennai.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

== Theni Forest Fire Disaster == 
On 11 March 2018, a group of trekkers on their way from [[Kolukkumalai]], trekking downhill towards [[Kurangani]] [http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/mar/14/official-to-probe-theni-wild-fire-that-killed-11-persons-1787098.html got trapped by wildfire]. This group included 27 members of a 2-day trek organized by CTC to celebrate Woman’s Day and another 12 member group on a trek organized by a private tour company. 3 of the trekkers reportedly turned back before the rest faced the wildfire. Unfortunately, [https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2018/03/16/theni-forest-fire-death-toll-rises.html 16 trekkers lost their lives in the disaster].

==Controversies==
Chennai Trekking Club allowed children in the trek that met with [http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/toll-in-kurangani-forest-fire-rises-to-14/article23267734.ece Theni Forest Fire Disaster], but later it was revealed that there was another group of trekkers from Erode, on a trekking tour organized by a private tour company. It was this company who [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/erode/death-toll-in-forest-fire-goes-up-to-12-organizer-arrested/articleshow/63307469.cms allowed three children in the trek]. It was also reported in the media that Chennai Trekking Club had organised the trekking without proper permission or approval from the authorities.  [http://chennaitrekkers.org/2018/03/kurangani/ Chennai Trekking Club has disputed this claim] and this is currently under investigation.

==Media==

CTC members also document landscapes and wildlife discovered during the treks. Photos are geo-tagged, published and shared on the CTC blog and the photographers' own [[Picassa]] pages. CTC has published more than 30,000 photos taken during their treks.&lt;ref name="albums"&gt;{{citation

The numbers of expatriates from the [[People's Republic of China]] began to increase noticeably between 2002 and 2005.&lt;ref name="CCTV"&gt;{{citation|url=http://big5.cctv.com/news/world/20050608/100425.shtml|date=2005-06-08|accessdate=2007-09-06|title=伊朗印象/Impressions of Iran|periodical=China Central Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and employment==
Most modern Chinese expatriates work on construction or other engineering projects; a few run import/export companies or other small businesses. Large-scale investment projects are also becoming more common; businessmen from [[Zhejiang]] began building Iran's first Chinese trade complex in 2006. The 330,000 square-metre site in the south of the country, located five kilometres from [[Khorramshahr]] and twenty kilometres from the [[Iraq]]i border, is expected to contain 1,500 businesses and cost [[Renminbi|RMB]]600 million to complete.&lt;ref name="Gansu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.china.com.cn/economic/txt/2006-06/03/content_6228526.htm|periodical=东方早报/Oriental Daily|date=2006-06-06|accessdate=2007-09-06|title=浙商投6億在伊朗建"中國商貿城" 同時針對伊拉克|trans-title=Zhejiang businessmen spend RMB600 million to build Iranian "Chinese commerce city"; take aim at Iraq at the same time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural integration==
One ''[[People's Daily]]'' reporter described Chinese people in Iran often have trouble adapting to local life. They live in a separate sphere from Iranians. Most cannot speak much [[Persian language|Persian]]. Because the number of Chinese in the country is so small, Chinese people are typically taken to be [[Koreans]] or [[Japanese people]] instead, unlike in other countries where the opposite mistake is more common. [[Chinese cuisine]] is largely unavailable.&lt;ref name="CCTV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RenminRibao"&gt;{{citation|url=http://world.people.com.cn/GB/14549/4671886.html|date=2006-08-07|accessdate=2007-09-06|periodical=People's Daily|author=刘守望/Liu Shouwang|title=伊朗华人过得挺安逸|trans-title=Iran's Chinese live quite comfortably}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Chinese people married to Iranians, [[international students]] are the group of Chinese in Iran best integrated into mainstream society, in terms of lifestyle and language. Their total number is estimated at roughly 100; unlike other Chinese residents, most live outside of Tehran, because the number of scholarships offered by universities in the capital has been decreasing.&lt;ref name="Gansu"/&gt; There is a small [[Chinatown]] in Iran built on a Chinese theme, known as [[Mahale Chiniha]].

'''Convention Camp''' is a conference on digital future, social media and web culture. It takes place annually since 2008 at [[Hanover fairground]] and is the largest [[BarCamp]] in [[Germany]].

== History ==
The Convention Camp was launched in 2008 by the publisher ''yeebase media'' and the web agency ''w3design''. The first event was held on October 2, 2008 at the University of Hanover. It initially focused [[knowledge management]] and social media software for companies in the foreground.

The second event was held on November 26, 2009. Beginning 2010, the ''Institute for Marketing and Management'' of the [[University of Hannover]] supports the ConventionCamp.

On November 8, 2011, the fourth ConventionCamp took place. In the background of [[Stuttgart 21]] and [[Occupy Wall Street]], focus of the program was the relationship of society and the Internet. A total of 1,500 visitors attended the conference. In the evening the ''t3n Web Awards'' were awarded for the best German websites in several categories.

In 2012, [[Julian Assange]] has taken part by [[videoconference]]. In other sessions for example speaker ''Markus Franz'' posed the question of the [[Wikipedia]]s in the future.

== Notability ==
The Convention Camp is a mix of classic conference with fixed program and unconference where early visitors can submit their own proposals. With 1,500 participants, the last ConventionCamp is currently (as of September 2012) the largest BarCamp and after the ''re:publica'' the second largest conference on [[Internet]] issues in Germany. The topics discussed at the event reach a wide reception in the trade press, including the participation of prominent speakers contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/ConventionCamp-2011-Wie-es-weitergeht-1375293.html | title = ConventionCamp 2011: Wie es weitergeht | language = German | work = heise online | date = 2011-11-08 | accessdate = 2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ConventionCamp or its initiators were awarded in March 2011 with the so-called LIDA Award. The abbreviation LIDA stands for ''Leader in the Digital Age'', patron of the award was the Lower Saxony Minister of Economics Jörg Bode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://celleheute.de/verleihung-leader-in-the-digital-age-award/ | title = Verleihung Leader in the Digital Age Award | work = Celle Heute | date = 2011-03-02 | accessdate = 2012-09-24 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article discusses '''Corruption in Australia''', in both private sector and public sectors.

==Rankings and research==
Corruption in Australia is relatively uncommon when compared to other nations worldwide. Transparency International's 2016 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] ranks the country 13th place out of 176 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/news/ranking-doesn-t-change-foreign-bribery-facts |title=Ranking doesn't change foreign bribery facts |last1=Jennings |first1=Andrew |date=13 December 2012 |publisher=Lawyers Weekly |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public sector corruption in Australia is similar to that in other developed nations like Canada and Norway as of 2014. However, according to this same index, corruption perception is increasing in Australia. In the 2015 Index Australia ranked 13th, dropping six positions since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/australia-perceived-as-more-corrupt/7118632|title= Australia continues slide down International Corruption Index, perceived as 'more corrupt'|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tai.org.au/sites/defualt/files/P381%20Costs%20of%20corruption%20FINAL.pdf|title=The cost of corruption|last=Aulby|first=Hannah|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=http://apo.org.au/node/127351|archive-date=February 2018|dead-url=|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon has also been studied by the [[Australian National University]], which produced a report called ''Perceptions of Corruption and Ethical Conduct'' (2012), which concluded: "there is a widespread perception that corruption in Australia has increased" and that "the media, [[trade unions]] and political parties were seen as [[Australia]]'s most corrupt institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/media-unions-and-political-parties-seen-as-australias-most-corrupt-institutions-10533 |title=Media, unions and political parties seen as Australia’s most corrupt institutions |last1=Creagh |first1=Sunanda |date=5 November 2012 |publisher=The Coversation |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2015 by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand found government and private firms in Australia and nearby New Zealand both display widespread "complacent" attitudes about corruption, particularly in regards to companies bidding for government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Lannin, Sue. [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-17/australian-firms-too-relaxed-about-corruption/6784662 Australian firms too 'complacent' about corruption] ABC.net.au, 17 September 2015; accessed 16 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, a discussion paper published by the Australia Institute, suggested that the trust in the Australian government is at a historical low, which could have reduced the GDP by as much as 4% or $72.3 billion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A report by Australian Public Service Commission's released in 2018, stated that investigations were conducted in only 0.3% of the workforce, meaning a total of 596 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stateoftheservice.apsc.gov.au/2018/01/aps-values-code-conduct-2/|title=APS Values and the Code of Conduct · State of the Service|last=Commission|first=Australian Public Service|date=2018-01-08|work=State of the Service|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Australia has a strong record of global, regional and domestic action to prevent and expose corrupt activity. These include the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group, APEC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Working Group and the United Nations Convention against Corruption Working Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/default.aspx|title=  Attorney-General's Department &gt;&gt; Crime and corruption &gt;&gt; Anti-corruption|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Australians regard the acceptance of luxury gifts by Australian politicians to be a form of corruption through bribery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/photo-bombshell-stuart-robert-tony-abbott-and-ian-macfarlane-in-power-dinner-with-chinese-mogul/news-story/5a81f0ab63e4492eeb69505b8996c4a9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emíl Wíesel''' (1 March 1866, Saint-Petersburg – 2 May 1943, Leningrad) – a painter, museum curator and a board member of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], Russia (since 1914), organizer of international art exhibitions, councilor of [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] and [[Russian museum]] and [[Legion of Honor]] holder. During soviet times he was an expert in Russian and Western fine arts and sculpture in the Glavnauka (central administrative board of science, science-artistic and museum institutions) museum department.

== Family ==
[[File:Эмиль Оскарович Визель.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Emil von Wiesel]]
Emil Oskarovich Wiesel (Wiesel Emil Anton Joseph) – baron, the son of [[Table of Ranks|Acting State Councilor]] (rank in civil service in pre-1917 Russia), descended from the German-Austrian Wiesel family.

Father – Oskar Borisovich Wiesel (Wiesel Oscar Sigismund), born in Russia in 1826, graduated from Prince Bezborodko's Gymnasium of Higher Learning in Nizhyn (nowadays [[Nizhyn Gogol State University]]), worked in the Russian Ministry of Finance, repeatedly visited Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris on behalf of their Majesties tsars [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]].

Mother – Marie Christine de Pointin was born in 1835. Her father Fransois de Pointin who had family roots from the French province of [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]] was born at [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII's]] court in exile in [[Warsaw]]. He was notable for building the silver iconostasis of the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] (St. Petersburg) and was awarded the [[Order of St. Anna]] by graf Yuliy Pompeevich Litte (ital., Giulio Renato de Litta Visconti Arese).

Brother – Oskar Oskarovich Wiesel ([[Oscar Wiesel|Wiesel Osсar Bernhard Franz]]) was born in Russia in 1864. Graduated as a lawyer, worked in Spitsbergen and in Switzerland as a Russian consul, later as a general consul in Italy (Napoli) in rank of acting state councilor.

Wife – Alexandra Emilievna Straus (Strauss Alexandra Hermina) (1866–1939) studied in Kiev gymnasium and passed a course of applied art at the Imperator’s artists encouragement society in St.Petersburg in the fields of “china-ware painting” and “wood carving”.

== Education ==
[[File:Эмиль Оскарович Визель2.jpg|thumb|100px|Emil Wiesel]]

Emil Wiesel graduated from [[Saint Petersburg State University|St.Petersburg University]], from physics and mathematics faculty. His interest in drawing and painting induced him at the same time to attend evening lessons at school of the Imperator’s artists encouragement society, which was followed by attending the Imperial Academy of Arts. Subsequently he proceeded his education in Munich at [[Alexander von Wagner|Alexander von Wagner’s]] studio, there he mastered the drawing technique typical for this school, which includes the well-defined outline and highly detailed image.

Later, together with his friend, Ivan Endogurov, also an artist, he moved to Paris. There they were admitted to [[Fernand Cormon|Fernand Cormon’s]] studio, which was famous during that period, being a place where academism could contest with the strengthening impressionism. Cormon’s classes were attended by such distinctive artists as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was Cormon who showed Wiesel new graphic methods that became a basis of his impressionistic picture technique that relied not on the outline but on treatment of light and shade. Wiesel has also studied in [[Académie Colarossi]] in Paris.

== Creative work ==
[[File:В.Сфороницкий.jpg|thumb|130px|Emil Wiesel. Portreit of Vladimir Sofronitsky]]
Wiesel was recognized as a mature artist after his and Endogurov’s paintings were started to exhibit in [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salons]] (1894 and 1901). At the beginning of the 20th century Emil Wiesel performed a portrait series of his eminent contemporaries: graf [[Vladimir Kokovtsov|Vladimir Kokovtsev]], academician [[Alexander Karpinsky]], astronomer [[Sergey Glazenap]], artist [[Ilya Repin]], physician Gundobin N.P., singer Leonid Sobinov, ballet dancers [[Marie Petipa]] and [[Galina Ulanova]], composers [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Ilya Glazunov]] and others. On demand he created portraits of the presidents of the Academy of Arts, [[House of Romanov|tsar’s family]] members, and later [[Vladimir Lenin]]. A particular place in his heritage is given to numerous pictures performed in his impressionistic manner reflecting his love for St.Petersturg and its surroundings: impressions on his events, journeys and meetings with various people.

His portraits in oil paint and a huge series of pictures of Vladimir Sofronitsky are run through with lyricism. Wiesel worked in painting and graphic arts using oil, watercolor, gouache, Indian ink, Italian and lead pencils. He proved himself as a master in the portrait, landscape, interior imaging, and scenic genre.

== Exhibitions==
Wiesel’s pictures are stored and exhibited in museums of Moscow, St. Petersburg, [[Saratov]] and [[Kazan]]. The Theatre museum in St. Petersburg keeps his watercolor and pencil scenes and actors sketches. A part of Wiesel’s documents, correspondence and pictures are kept by the Academy of Arts, the Bibliotheca named after Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, and the St. Petersburg History Museum. The first personal exhibition was held at the date of the 100th anniversary in 1966 in the Academy of Arts Museum. More than 160 Wiesel’s canvases were exhibited in 1998 in Kazan Museum of Fine Arts together with other pictures of the members of Wiesel dynasty. The Emil Wiesel's art heritage was exhibited twice in 2012:
* "The Wiesel Dynasty", Moscow
* "Germans in Russia", Kazan State Museum

== Activities: museums, exhibitions, organizational and science work ==

[[File:Визель и королева Италии.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Emil Wiesel (the first from the left) is introduced to the queen of Italy]]
In 1894 Emil Wiesel was invited to become the assistant to the curator of the Academy of Arts Museum. It was a Wiesel’s initiative to found new department in the Imperial Academy of Arts. He took part in the Russian Museum’s collection development (1898). He reissued a new charter, held reorganizations, supported provincial museum launches and controlled their activities.

In 1900 Wiesel went to Paris as a representative of Russia to run the Russian department of fine arts at the international exhibition. The French government appreciated his activities and granted him with a Legion of Honor. Later he organized the Russian departments of fine arts at the international exhibitions in Munich (1901), Brussels (1910), Rome (1911), and Turin (1913). In 1914 Emil Wiesel was chosen to become a full member of the Imperial Academy of Arts. He worked as a Russian and Western fine arts and sculpture expert in the committee in Glavnauka (the central administrative board of science, the science-artistic institution and the museum institution) museum department and a councilor of the Hermitage and Russian museums.
During the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]] Emil Wiesel evacuated the Academy of Arts Museum’s collections to Moscow in order to save the masterpieces, and later returned them back to Pertograd (St.Petersburg).

Emil Wiesel also performed scientific work: he performed reports and wrote articles in mass media on the topic of museums activities. He participated in cataloguing the exhibits of the Academy of Arts Museum (1915). There survives his fundamental scientific work “The interrelation of visual perceptions and the expression of fine art” (1930).

== Exile to Kazakhstan and Siege of Leningrad (the Leningrad Blockade)==
During the period of Stalin’s repressions, Emil Wiesel, his wife, his son Oscar Wiesel (ethno-linguist, professor of Institute of Oriental Studies in Leningrad (St. Petersburg)) with his wife Vera Sholpo, and Emil’s grandson Andrey Wiesel were sent to Kazakhstan, to the village Chelkar (1935).  Despite financial and living difficulties, Emil Wiesel and Vera Sholpo, both artists, continued creating portraits and landscapes, now on the Central Asian plot. Emil Wiesel and his wife managed to return to Leningrad after two years thanks to a close family friend Vladimir Sofronitsky. One year later his son Oscar Wiesel and family also left Kazakhstan. Since they were not allowed to settle in Moscow or Leningrad, they chose Kazan as a place of living, a city with a university, rich with museums, theaters and intellectual and artistic life, where both an artist and a linguist could find a job.

The Siege of Leningrad was the last challenge to Emil Wiesel. He died at the age of 77 years in 1943.

== Addresses  ==
Saint-Petersburg, 4th Line (Liniya), [[Vasilyevsky Island]], 1.

The family Wiesel owned a house on the Medumi lake ([[Medumi]], Latvia), and the village Grinishki (nowadays Teteri, Latvia).

'''Entuzjastki''' was a Polish women's organisation, counted as the first women's organisation in Poland. It was a progressive association founded in 1830 by a group of women intellectuals in favor of equal rights between men and women. It encouraged the independence of women and regarded education, professional life and the economic independence this gave as the means to achieve this. 

The organisation was centered around [[Narcyza Żmichowska]]. Among its members where [[Emilia Gosselin]], [[Wiktoria Lewińska]], [[Zofia Mielęcka-Węgierska]], [[Bibianna Moraczewska]], [[Faustyna Morzycka]], [[Kryspina Siewielińska-Stelmowska]], [[Anna Skimborowiczowa|Anna z Sokołowskich Skimborowiczowa]], [[Wincenta Zabłocka]], [[Paulina Zbyszewska]] and [[Kazimiera Ziemięcka]].

The '''Football Lads Alliance''' ('''FLA''') is a movement in the [[United Kingdom]] founded by John Meighan in 2017. According to ''[[The Times]]'', "the movement was set up as a self-proclaimed 'anti-extremist' movement" but has increasingly become associated with [[far-right politics]] and far-right activists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/premier-league-clubs-warned-over-far-right-football-lads-alliance-0mgq2lppv|title=Premier League clubs warned over ‘far-right’ Football Lads Alliance|author=Times Investigation|date=30 March 2018|publisher=Times Newspapers|work=Times Online}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_Three"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Bryant | first1 = Ben | last2 = Frymorgen | first2 = Tomasz  | title = Football Lads Alliance: ‘We could have a civil war in this country’ | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/e5ee9e0a-18d7-49a4-a3c2-80b6b4222058 | work = [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]] | date = 9 May 2018 | access-date = 21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Premier League]] has warned clubs that "the group is using fans and stadiums to push an anti-Muslim agenda".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Concern has also been expressed that the Alliance is "giving cover to the far right"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/football-lads-alliance-inside-far-right-march-london-edl-london-a7988451.html|title=Inside the Football Lads Alliance march through London|date=7 October 2017|publisher=ESL Media|work=The Independent|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "uses a secret Facebook page full of violent, racist and misogynistic posts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/football-lads-alliance-secret-facebook-page-racism-violence-sexism|title=Secret Facebook page reveals violence at heart of forum for ‘football fans’|first=Tom|last=Wall|date=17 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Following a number of terror attacks in the UK, including the [[2017 Westminster attack|Westminster Bridge attack]] (22 March 2017) and the [[Manchester Arena bombing|bombing of Manchester Arena]] (22 May 2017), a group of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (Spurs) supporters organised a march in London, June 2017 against extremism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Keoghan | first = Jim | title = The far-right is attempting to return to football.

The FLA was registered as a private company in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Football Lads Alliance Ltd | url = https://companycheck.co.uk/company/10912702/FOOTBALL-LADS-ALLIANCE-LIMITED/companies-house-data | website = companycheck.co.uk | publisher = Company Check | access-date = 21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A store was opened online selling t-shirts, hoodies and caps. 

The second FLA march was in October 2017, present were members "[[Veterans Against Terrorism]]" (VAT), an advocacy group made up of claimed military veterans which opposes what it describes as "[[Islamist extremists]]".&lt;ref name="New_Chron"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hill | first = Laura | title = Veterans Against Terrorism march in Newcastle: Charities distance themselves as organiser speaks | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/veterans-against-terrorism-march-newcastle-14296775 | work = [[Evening Chronicle]] | location = Newcastle| publisher = [[Trinity Mirror]] | quote = Antony Harrison, one of the organisers behind the Veterans Against Terrorism group... insisted the group isn’t linked to any right-wing organisations - especially the EDL - and the only other movement it works with is the Football Lads Association.  | date = 16 February 2018 | access-date = 27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD) monitored the FLA’s social media posts as part of their ongoing research into extremist movements and tactics online. It reported that, in less than a year, the FLA has moved to the [[Right-wing politics|right]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Three" /&gt;

FLA organized a campaign selling pin badges featuring the poppy symbol of the [[Royal British Legion]] donating sums collected to the Legion. The charity however returned a £1,104 donation back to the FLA on 11 April 2018 saying that, "a small number of FLA supporters have expressed views and opinions that are not compatible with the values of The Royal British Legion."&lt;ref name="BBC_Three" /&gt; 

FLA founder Meighan stood down on 16 April 2018 saying that the company would be dissolved.&lt;ref name="BBC_Three" /&gt;

An FLA march was held on 19 May 2018 to mark the first anniversary of [[Manchester Arena bombing]] with around 200 attending. An opposition rally was organized with around 800 with speakers from anti-racist and anti-fascist movements, local councillors and trade union bodies.&lt;ref name="SalfStar_190518"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Hundreds of Stand Up To Racism campaigners oppose FLA rally in Manchester | url = http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=4518 | work = Salford Star | date = 15 May 2018 | access-date = 25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FLA split and formation of DFLA===
[[File:Democratic_Football_Lads_Alliance_logo.png|thumb|right|Logo of the Democratic Football Lads Alliance or the "true" FLA.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;]]
The organisation split over certain issues, with some senior activists setting up the '''Democratic Football Lads Alliance''' ('''DFLA''' or the "'''Democratic FLA'''" or "true FLA").&lt;ref name="BBC_Three" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Richards | first = Andy | title = Pub bombings campaigner to speak at huge football supporter demo in Birmingham | url = https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/pub-bombings-campaigner-speak-huge-14427361 | work = [[Birmingham Mail]] | publisher = [[Trinity Mirror]] | quote = The True Democratic Football Lads Alliance has split from the Football Lads Alliance | date = 18 March 2018 | access-date = 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has adopted the slogan "Against All Extremism".

Rape involving at least two or more violators (typically at least three&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Neumann, Stephani. Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilia. Hickey, Eric W., 397-407&lt;/ref&gt;) is reported throughout the world. Systematic information and statistics on the extent of the problem is limited.

One study showed that offenders and victims in gang rape incidents were younger and more likely to be unemployed compared to cases of rape by one perpetrator. Gang rapes involved more alcohol and [[Substance abuse|drug use]], night attacks and severe [[sexual assault]] outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes.&lt;ref name=Ullman1999&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ullman |first=S.

The two groups were about the same in the amount of drug use and drinking during the assault.&lt;ref name=Gidycz1990&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gidycz |first1=C. A. | last2 = Koss |first2=M.

Gang rape is sometimes referred to as "group rape", "party rape", or "multiple perpetrator rape" in scholarly literature.&lt;ref name=ullman&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2013). 11 Multiple perpetrator rape victimization.

==Causes and characteristics==
Gang rapes often involve three or more men&lt;!--NOTE: We go by what the WP:Reliable sources state, with WP:Due weight; the sources do not report that the usual perpetrators of gang rapes are women; they report that men are usually the perpetrators.--&gt; as perpetrators. These rapes have characteristics beyond those found in rape by individuals; for example, gang rapists tend to be younger and serial in their crimes, the gang is more often under the influence of drugs or alcohol, of the same race or religion or place of residence thereby forming a close-knit peer pressure group, encouraged by the behavior of their fellow criminals. Gang rapes are more violent; the sexual and non-sexual injuries to the victim are often far more severe. The gang members typically dehumanize their target victim(s) before and during the rape.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, Sarah (1999). A comparison of gang and individual rape incidents. Violence and victims, 14(2), pp. 123–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, L. E., &amp; Alison, L. J. (2001). A Partially Ordered Scale of Influence in Violent Group Behavior An Example From Gang Rape.

Porter and Alison have analyzed 739 gang rape cases from US and UK, and found over 20% of the gang rape victims died from injuries from the gang rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Porter L. E., Alison L. J. | year = 2006 | title = Examining group rape: A descriptive analysis of offender and victim behaviour | url = | journal = European Journal of Criminology | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 357–381 | doi=10.1177/1477370806065586}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study based on 25 year crime data from US and Europe, between 10% to 20% of all rapes were gang rapes. Less than one in three gang rapes are reported, while less than 1 in 20 attempted but failed gang rapes are reported.&lt;ref name=ullman/&gt;

A 2013 Lancet report on rape and gang rape in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka found that the crime was committed for various motives, such as sexual entitlement, seeking of entertainment, and a means to inflict punishment on the victim.&lt;ref name=lancetrapestudy/&gt; Associated factors in the crime included alcohol misuse, poverty, personal history of childhood victimization, need to prove heterosexual performance, dominance over women, and participation in gangs and related activities. Most cases were not reported to law enforcement, and just 23% of single or multiple perpetrator rapes that were reported by the victims ended in prison sentence.&lt;ref name=lancetrapestudy/&gt;

Gang rapes during civil wars and ethnic riots take added dimension of becoming a means of revenge, sending a message to the victims' community, inducing fear in the opponent, and creating a sense of solidarity among the soldiers or militants or the violent group.&lt;ref&gt;Olujic, M. B. (1995). Women, rape, and war: The continued trauma of refugees and displaced persons in Croatia.

Qualitative research, pp. 99–112, chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang rape is sometimes stereotyped in media as a crime of poor, minorities, or culture; however, gang rape incidence rates are high in wealthy college campuses, among non-minorities and every culture.&lt;ref name="Sanday, P. 2007"&gt;Sanday, P. (2007). Fraternity gang rape: Sex, brotherhood, and privilege on campus. New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-4038-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everywhere there is a tendency to blame the victim; however, gang rapes are almost always premeditated in their intent, target victim(s), social proof, and psychological causes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Merril (Ed.).

John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study,&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Julie and Wrightsman, Lawrence (1993). Rape: The misunderstood crime. Sage, {{ISBN|978-0803937079}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 70% of the victims were gang raped by rapists of same race and religion. Most covered and debated gang rapes tend to be those involving victim and rapists of different race or religion or social class.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Gang rape can be interpreted as an example of a group [[criminal spin#Group|criminal spin]]. Accordingly, a group of individuals may perform an initial behavior that proceeds in a criminal direction far beyond the initial intention of its participants. Within this process, each group member contributes a certain role towards the development of the criminal spin—even the passive members, who are silent participants, support the spin by their very presence. It is considered a group criminal spin because the most gang members perform this act only during a group interaction, "letting themselves" deviate from their everyday norms. On these occasions, the group interaction provides an "I can" component of a spin: Although each member does not usually sense an inner ability and permission to act in the criminal direction, i.e., to gang rape, the perceived power of the group supplies this sense and allows the act. In the same way, a group interaction may display an "I must" motive, thus social forces within the group directs it towards raping. In any case, the interaction of members of a group in a spin gives rise to self-centered norms that contribute to the further development of the criminal spin till the extreme point of an accomplishment of the rape.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Bangladesh===
A 2013 Lancet study reports 1.9% of all rural men in Bangladesh have committed multiple perpetrator rape (gang rape) of a woman who was not a partner, compared to 1.4% urban men. 35% of those who have committed gang rapes against women have also committed additional rapes where the victim was a man. The motives of rape included a combination of reasons. Two thirds of the gang rape perpetrators claimed entertainment as their motive, 30% claimed they participated in gang rape out of anger and to inflict punishment on the victim, while 11% indicated the crime followed alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name=lancetrapestudy&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jewkes | first1 = Rachel | year = 2013 | title = Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific | journal = The Lancet Global Health | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–218 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70069-X | url = https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2813%2970069-X/abstract| accessdate = 20 July 2014 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 25104346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Crime Prevention Minister [[Norman Baker]] described "ground breaking work" to identify women and girls who can get drawn into gangs. "Girls associated with gangs can face sexual violence and we have provided £1.2m for 13 Young People's Advocates to support those at risk," he said on the launch of a report by the [[Centre for Social Justice]] (CSJ), a think-tank established in 2002 by [[Iain Duncan Smith]], another Cabinet minister. Baker said the government had set up a network of more than 70 people with experience of dealing with gangs to work with 33 of the worst affected areas of the country, including 20 in [[London]]. In one case cited by the CSJ report, a schoolgirl was abducted and sexually assaulted by nine males because she criticised a gang member. The report found that girls as young as eight were being used to carry drugs while female gang members in their teens were being pressured to have sex with boys as young as 10 to initiate males into gangs. A 2014 report by the [[Children's Commissioner for England|Office of the Children's Commissioner]] suggested that almost 2,500 children had been known to be victims of child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10717751/Rape-is-a-weapon-against-gang-girls-says-report.html|title='Rape is a weapon against gang girls', says report|first=Padraic|last=Flanagan|date=23 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TheGovernessRebeccaSolomon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In [[Rebecca Solomon]]'s 1851 painting ''The Governess'', the title figure (seated right, with her charge) exhibits the modest dress and deportment appropriate to her quasi-invisible role in the Victorian household.]]
{{Childcare}}

A '''governess''' is a woman employed to teach and train children in a private household.  In contrast to a [[nanny]] (formerly called a nurse), she concentrates on teaching children instead of meeting their physical needs. Her charges are of school age rather than babies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/outbackhouse/txt/s1378699.htm A Governess's Duties], ''[[Outback House]]'' ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of governess used to be common in well-off European families before the [[First World War]], especially in the countryside where no suitable school existed nearby. Parents' preference to educate their children at home—rather than send them away to [[boarding school]] for months at a time—varied across time and countries.  Governesses were usually in charge of girls and younger boys.  When a boy was old enough, he left his governess for a [[tutor]] or a school.

Governesses are rarer now, except within [[great house|large and wealthy households]] or royal families such as the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Desert Governess: An Inside View on the Saudi Arabian Royal Family |last=Ellis |first=Phyllis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Eye Books |location=London |isbn=1-903070-01-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in remote regions such as [[outback]] Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Julia: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050308222122/http://www.abc.net.au/westqld/stories/s1220741.htm A career as a Governess? What skills do you need?], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 15 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a recent resurgence amongst families worldwide to employ governesses or full-time tutors. The reasons for this include personal security, the benefits of a tailored education, and the flexibility to travel or live in multiple locations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/4995583/Return-of-the-governess-as-parents-look-to-give-children-exam-advantage.html Telegraph.co.uk], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Traditionally, governesses taught "[[the three Rs]]" (reading, writing, and arithmetic) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life in Old Virginia; A Description of Virginia More Particularly the Tidewater Section, Narrating Many Incidents Relating to the Manners and Customs of Old Virginia so Fast Disappearing As a Result of the War between the States, Together with Many Humorous Stories |last=McDonald |first=James Joseph, and J. A. C. Chandler |year=1907 |publisher=Old Virginia Pub. Co. |location=Norfold, Va |page=241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to young children.  They also taught the "accomplishments" expected of [[middle class]] women to the young ladies under their care, such as [[French language|French]] or another language, the [[piano]] or another musical instrument, and often [[painting]] (usually the more ladylike [[watercolours]] rather than [[Oil painting|oils]]) or [[poetry]]. It was also possible for other teachers (usually male) with specialist knowledge and skills to be brought in, such as, a drawing master or dancing master.

===In the United Kingdom===
The governess occupied a uniquely awkward position in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] household, because she was neither a [[servant (domestic)|servant]] nor yet a member of the host family. She worked in the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom#Upper class|upper-class home]] of the [[landed gentry]] or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away from the rest of the family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.

However, being a governess was one of the few legitimate ways by which an unmarried middle class woman could support herself in Victorian society. Not surprisingly, her position was often depicted as one to be pitied, and the only way out of it was to get married. Unfortunately, it was difficult for a governess to find a suitable husband because most of the eligible men she encountered were her social superiors, who preferred a bride from within their own social class, particularly since such women generally had better financial resources.

Once a governess's charges grew up, she had to seek a new position, or, exceptionally, might be retained by the grown-up daughter as a [[Lady's companion|paid companion]].

===Outside the United Kingdom===
An option for the more adventurous was to find an appointment abroad. The [[Russian Empire]] proved to be a relatively well-paid option for many. According to [[Harvey Pitcher]] in ''When Miss Emmie was in Russia: English Governesses before, during and after the October Revolution'',&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, Harvey (1977). ''When Miss Emmie was in Russia: English Governesses before, during and after the October Revolution'', {{ISBN|1906011494}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many as thousands of English-speaking governesses went there. As English became the fashionable language of choice among the aristocracy during the later days of the regime, clearly they were displacing opportunities formerly spread more across the French-speaking world. The estimate of numbers ('thousands'), although necessarily vague, is justified by some knowledge of the main [[lodging house]] used by those not accommodated with their host families, [[St. Andrew's Anglican Church, Moscow#Early history|St. Andrew's House, Moscow]], and by the places of worship they preferentially frequented, for example [[St. Andrew's Anglican Church, Moscow|the church associated with the House]]. Pitcher drew extensively on the archives of the [[Queen's College, London#History|Governesses' Benevolent Institution]] in London; there is also some allusion to the phenomenon of governesses being engaged abroad in ''A galaxy of governesses'' by Bea Howe.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Bea (1954): ''A galaxy of governesses'' (London, D. Verschoyle)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green criminology''' is a branch of [[criminology]] that involves the study of harms and [[crimes against the environment]] broadly conceived, including the study of environmental law and policy, the study of [[corporate crimes]] against the environment, and environmental justice from a criminological perspective.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Origins ==

The term "green criminology" was introduced by Michael J. Lynch in 1990, and expanded upon in Nancy Frank and Michael J. Lynch’s 1992 book, ''Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence'',&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Nancy and Michael J. Lynch  1992  Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence. Albany, NY:  Harrow and Heston.&lt;/ref&gt; which examined the political economic origins of green crime and injustice, and the scope of environmental law. The term became more widely used following publication of a special issue on green criminology in the journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' edited by Piers Beirne and Nigel South (1998, volume 2, number 2). Green criminology has recently started to feature in university-level curriculum and textbooks in criminology and other disciplinary fields.&lt;ref&gt;White, R., &amp; Heckenberg, D. (2014) 'Green Criminology: An Introduction to the Study of Environmental Harm' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of green criminology has expanded significantly over time, and is supported by groups such as the ''International Green Criminology Working Group'' [http://greencriminology.org/ See http://greencriminology.org/].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are increasing interfaces and hybrid empirical and theoretical influences between the study of green criminology, which focuses on environmental harms and crimes, and mainstream criminology and criminal justice, with criminologists studying the 'greening' of criminal justice institutions and practices in efforts to become more environmentally sustainable and the involvement of people in prison or on probation in ecological justice initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4 'Greening Justice' of Graham, H., &amp; White, R. (2015) 'Innovative Justice' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, R., &amp; Graham, H. (2015) 'Greening Justice: Examining the Interfaces of Criminal, Social and Ecological Justice' British Journal of Criminology [Advance Online Access]: 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, D., &amp; Jewkes, Y.

== Approaches ==

Though green criminology was originally proposed as a political economic approach for the study of environmental harm, crime, law and justice, there are now several varieties of green criminology as noted below.&lt;ref&gt;For a general guide to green criminology, its definition, and varieties see, South, Nigel, Avi Brisman, and Piers Beirne. (2013). A guide to a green criminology. Pp. 27-42 in  N. South and A. Brisman (eds), The Routledge international handbook of green criminology. UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political economy, environmental justice, and the treadmill of production approach ===

The initial grounding of green criminology was in political economic theory and analysis. In his original 1990 article,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael J. 1990. The Greening of Criminology: A Perspective for the 1990s. The Critical Criminologist 2,3:3-4,11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch proposed green criminology as an extension of [[radical criminology]] and its focus on political economic theory and analysis. In that view, it was essential to examine the political economic dimensions of green crime and justice in order to understand the major environmental issues of our times and how they connect with the political economy of capitalism. The political economic approach was expanded upon by Lynch and Paul B. Stretesky in two additional articles in the Critical Criminologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1999. Clarifying the Analysis of Environmental Justice: Further Thoughts on the Critical Analysis of Environmental Justice Issues. The Critical Criminologist. 9,3: 5-8;   Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1998. Uniting Class and Race with Criticism Through the Study of Environmental Justice. The Critical Criminologist. Fall: 1, 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In those articles, Lynch and Stretesky extended the scope of green criminology to apply to the study of environmental justice, and followed that work with a series of studies addressing environmental justice concerns,&lt;ref&gt;Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J. Lynch. 2002. Environmental Hazards and School Segregation in Hillsborough, 1987-1999. The Sociological Quarterly. 43,4: 553-573; Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J . Lynch. 1999.

Stretesky, and Ronald G. Burns. 2004. Slippery Business: Race, Class and Legal Determinants of Penalties Against Petroleum Refineries.

Organization and Environment, 23 (4): 398–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, working with Michael A. Long and then Kimberly L. Barrett, the political economic explanation and empirical studies of green crimes were adapted to include a perspective on the structural influence of the [[environmental sociology|treadmill of production]] on the creation of green crimes &lt;ref&gt;Long, Michael A., Paul B. Stretesky, Michael J. Lynch and Emily Fenwick. 2012. Crime in the Coal Industry: Implications for Green Criminology and Treadmill of Production Theory. Organization &amp; Environment  25,3:  299-316;  Lynch, Michael J., Michael A. Long, Kimberly L. Barrett and Paul B. Stretesky. (2013). Is it a Crime to Produce Ecological Disorganization? Why Green Criminology and Political Economy Matter in the Analysis of Global Ecological Harms. British Journal of Criminology  55, 3; 997-1016; Stretesky, Paul B., Michael A. Long and Michael J. Lynch. (2013a). The Treadmill of Crime: Political Economy and Green Criminology. UK:  Routledge; Stretesky, Paul B., Michael A. Long and Michael J. Lynch. (2013b) Does environmental enforcement slow the treadmill of production? The relationship between large monetary penalties, ecological disorganization and toxic releases within offending corporations. Journal of Crime and Justice  36, 2: 235-249.&lt;/ref&gt; drawn from the work of [[Allan Schnaiberg]], [[environmental sociology]], [[eco-socialism]] and [[ecological Marxism]].  Throughout the development of the political economic approach to green criminology, scholars have made significant use of scientific and ecological literatures, as well as empirical analysis, which have become characteristics of this approach and distinguish it from other varieties of green criminology.

=== Nonspeciesist and nonhuman animal studies ===

The second major variation of green criminology is the nonspeciesist argument proposed by Piers Beirne.&lt;ref&gt;Beirne, Piers. 1999. For a nonspeciesist criminology: Animal abuse as an object of study. Criminology 37, 1: 117-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Beirne’s view, the study of harms against nonhuman animals is an important criminological topic which requires attention and at the same time illustrates the limits of current criminological theorizing about, crime/harm, law and justice with its focus almost exclusively on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Beirne, Piers. 2009. Confronting animal abuse: Law, criminology, and human-animal relationships. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach also includes discussions of [[animal rights]]. Beirne’s approach to green criminology has been extremely influential, and there are now a significant number of studies within the green criminological literature focusing on nonhuman animal crimes and animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see the special issue of Crime, Law and Social Change Beirne has edited (volume 55, number 5); Cazaux, Geertrui. 1999. Beauty and the beast: Animal abuse from a non-speciesist criminological perspective. Crime, Law and Social Change 31, 2 : 105-125.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to studies of animal abuse, included within the scope of [[nonhuman animal]] studies are those focused on illegal [[wildlife trade]], [[poaching]], [[wildlife smuggling]], animal trafficking and the [[CITES|international trade in endangered species.]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Tanya. Green criminology &amp; wildlife trafficking: The illegal fur and falcon trades in Russia Far East. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2012; Wyatt, Tanya. 2009. Exploring the organization of Russia Far East's illegal wildlife trade: two case studies of the illegal fur and illegal falcon trades. Global Crime 10, 1-2: 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the studies green criminologists undertake in this area of research are theoretical or qualitative. Ron Clarke and several colleagues, however, have explored empirical examinations of illegal animal trade and trafficking,&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Andrew M., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2009. The international ban on ivory sales and its effects on elephant poaching in Africa. British Journal of Criminology 49, 4: 451-471;   Clarke, Ronald V., and A. Rolf. 2013. Poaching, habitat loss and the decline of neotropical parrots: a comparative spatial analysis. Journal of Experimental Criminology 9, 3: 333-353; Pires, Stephen, and Ronald V. Clarke. 2012. Are parrots CRAVED? An analysis of parrot poaching in Mexico. Journal of research in crime and delinquency 49, 1: 122-146; Pires, Stephen F., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2011. Sequential foraging, itinerant fences and parrot poaching in Bolivia. British Journal of Criminology 51, 2: 314-335.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has become a useful approach for examining green crimes. Clarke’s approach draws on more traditional criminological theory such as [[rational choice theory]] and [[crime opportunity theory]], and hence is not within the mainstream of green criminological approaches. Nevertheless, Clarke’s approach has drawn attention to important empirical explanations of green crimes.

=== Bio-piracy and eco-crimes ===

Similar to the political economic approach but without grounding in political economic theory, some green criminologists have explored the issue of green crime by examining how corporate behavior impacts green crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Vincenzo, and Nigel South. 2013. Green criminology and crimes of the economy: theory, research and praxis. Critical Criminology 21, 3: 359-373.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other issues, this approach has included discussions of eco-crimes and activities such as [[bio-piracy]] as discussed by Nigel South.&lt;ref&gt;South, Nigel. 2007. The ‘corporate colonisation of nature’: Bio-prospecting, bio-piracy and the development of green criminology. Pp. 230-247 in P. Beirne and N. South’s (ed), Issues in green criminology. Devon, UK: Willan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bio-piracy is largely an effort by corporations to commodify native knowledge and to turn native knowledge and practices into for-profit products while depriving native peoples of their rights to that knowledge and those products, and in most cases, avoiding payments to natives for their knowledge or products. Bio-piracy includes issues of [[social and economic justice]] for native peoples. These kinds of crimes fall into the category of eco-crimes, a term associated with the work of Reece Walters.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2006. Crime, bio-agriculture and the exploitation of hunger. British Journal of Criminology 46, 1: 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also included within the examination of eco-crimes is the analysis of other ecologically harmful corporate behaviors such as the production of [[genetically modified foods]] &lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2007. Food crime, regulation and the biotech harvest. European Journal of Criminology 4, 2: 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt; and various forms of toxic pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2010. Toxic atmospheres air pollution, trade and the politics of regulation. Critical Criminology 18, 4: 307-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-global criminology ===

Some of those who study environmental crime and justice prefer the use of Rob White’s term, eco-global criminology.&lt;ref&gt;White, Rob. 2011. Transnational environmental crime: Toward an eco-global criminology. UK: Routledge; Ellefsen, Rune, Guri Larsen, and Ragnhild Sollund (eds). 2012. Eco-global Crimes: Contemporary Problems and Future Challenges. UK: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  In proposing this term, White suggested that it is necessary to employ a critical analysis of environmental crime as it occurs in its global context and connections.&lt;ref&gt;White, Rob. 2009. Researching Transnational Environmental Harm: Toward an Eco‐Global Criminology. International journal of comparative and applied criminal justice 33, 2: 229-248.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Lynch’s political economic approach to green criminology, White has also noted that it is desirable to refer to the political economy of environmental crime, and to social and [[environmental justice]] issues.

=== Green-cultural criminology ===

As proposed by Avi Brisman and Nigel South &lt;ref&gt;Brisman, Avi, and Nigel South. 2013. A green-cultural criminology: An exploratory outline. Crime, Media, Culture 9, 2: 115-135.&lt;/ref&gt; green-cultural criminology attempts to integrate green and [[cultural criminology]] to explore the cultural meaning and significance of terms such as “environment” and “environmental crime.”

=== Conservation criminology ===

Conservation criminology is compliment to green criminology. Originally proposed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars from the Department of Fisheries &amp; Wildlife, School of Criminal Justice, and Environmental Science &amp; Policy Program at Michigan State University, conservation criminology seeks to overcome limitations inherent to single-discipline science and provide practical guidance about on-the-ground reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/1/124.short Gibbs, Carole, Meredith L. Gore, Edmund F. McGarrell, and Louie Rivers. 2010. Introducing conservation criminology towards interdisciplinary scholarship on environmental crimes and risks. British Journal of Criminology 50, 1: 124-144.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|date=2011-08-01|title=The Science of Conservation Crime|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01701.x/abstract|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=659–661|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01701.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.conservationcriminology.com/ Conservation criminology] is an interdisciplinary and applied paradigm for understanding programs and policies associated with global conservation risks. By integrating natural resources management, risk and decision science, and criminology, conservation criminology-based approaches ideally result in improved environmental resilience, biodiversity conservation, and secure human livelihoods. As an interdisciplinary science, conservation criminology requires the constant and creative combination of theories, methods, and techniques from diverse disciplines throughout the entire processes of research, practice, education, and policy. Thinking about the interdisciplinary nature of conservation criminology can be quite exciting but does require patience and understanding of the different languages, epistemologies and ontologies of the core disciplines. Conservation criminology has been extensively applied to extralegal exploitation of natural resources such as wildlife poaching in Namibia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L|last2=Ratsimbazafy|first2=Jonah|last3=Rajaonson|first3=Andry|last4=Lewis|first4=Amanda|last5=Kahler|first5=Jessica S|date=2016-07-12|title=Public perceptions of poaching risks in a biodiversity hotspot: Implications for wildlife trafficking interventions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305224010_Public_perceptions_of_poaching_risks_in_a_biodiversity_hotspot_Implications_for_wildlife_trafficking_interventions|journal=ResearchGate|volume=2016|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Madagascar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|last2=Lute|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Ratsimbazafy|first3=Jonah H.|last4=Rajaonson|first4=Andry|date=2016-04-15|title=Local Perspectives on Environmental Insecurity and Its Influence on Illegal Biodiversity Exploitation|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150337|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0150337|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150337|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4833313|pmid=27082106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  corruption in conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|last2=Ratsimbazafy|first2=Jonah|last3=Lute|first3=Michelle L.|date=2013-11-01|title=Rethinking Corruption in Conservation Crime: Insights from Madagascar|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12032/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=430–438|doi=10.1111/conl.12032|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; e-waste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Carole|last2=McGarrell|first2=Edmund F.|last3=Axelrod|first3=Mark|date=2010-08-01|title=Transnational white-collar crime and risk|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00649.x/abstract|journal=Criminology &amp; Public Policy|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=543–560|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00649.x|issn=1745-9133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general noncompliance with conservation rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Jennifer N.|last2=Gavin|first2=Michael C.|last3=Gore|first3=Meredith L.|date=2015-09-01|title=Detecting and understanding non-compliance with conservation rules|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715001822|journal=Biological Conservation|series=Detecting and Understanding Non-compliance with Conservation Rules|volume=189|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By relying on multiple disciplines, conservation criminology leapfrogs this ideal; it promotes thinking about second- and third-order consequences of risks, not just isolated trends.

== Green criminological theory ==

It is often noted that green criminology is interdisciplinary and as a result, lacks its own unique theory or any preferred theoretical approach. Moreover, significant portions of the green criminological literature are qualitative and descriptive, and those studies have generally not proposed a unique or unifying theory. Despite this general lack of a singular theory, some of the approaches noted above indicate certain theoretical preferences. For example, as noted, the political economic approach to green criminology develops explanations of green crime, victimization and environmental justice consistent with several existing strains of political economic analysis. Beirne’s approach takes an interdisciplinary view of theory with respect to various animal rights models and arguments. Clarke’s rational choice models of animal poaching and trafficking build on the rational choice tradition found within the criminological literature. To date, these different theoretical approaches have not been examined as competing explanations for green crime and justice, a situation that is found with respect to orthodox or traditional criminological theories of street crime.

According to the French national institute of statistics [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], the 2014 census counted nearly 6 million immigrants (foreign-born people) in France, representing 9.1% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3303358?sommaire=3353488#titre-bloc-3|title=Étrangers - Immigrés − Tableaux de l'économie française {{!}} Insee|website=www.insee.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2874034?sommaire=2874056&amp;geo=FE-1|title=IMG1A - Population par sexe, âge et situation quant à l'immigration en 2014 − France entière −Étrangers - Immigrés en 2014 {{!}} Insee|website=www.insee.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurostat]] estimated the foreign-born population to be 7.9 million, corresponding to 11.8% of the French population as of January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_January_2016_(%C2%B9).png|title=File:Foreign-born population by country of birth, 1 January 2016 (¹).png - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a previous [[INSEE]] census estimated that 5.3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6.5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in [[metropolitan France]] (62.1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5.5 million are of [[Europe]]an origin ([[Portuguese in France|Portuguese]], [[Spaniards in France|Spaniards]], [[Italians in France|Italians]], [[British migration to France|Britons]] and Several people from Eastern European countries.), 4 million of [[North Africa]]n  (either [[Arabs in France|Arab]]-[[Berbers in France|Berber]]) origin, 1 million of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n origin and 400,000 of [[Turks in France|Turkish]] origin.&lt;ref name="insee.fr"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=ip1287 Être né en France d’un parent immigré], [[Insee Première]], n°1287, mars 2010, Catherine Borrel et Bertrand Lhommeau, Insee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Insee_1"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=immigrespaysnais Répartition des immigrés par pays de naissance 2008], Insee, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The area with the largest proportion of immigrants is the Parisian urban area (Greater Paris), where almost 40% of immigrants lived in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2121524|title=La localisation géographique des immigrés - Insee Première - 1591|website=www.insee.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other regions with important immigrant populations are [[Rhône-Alpes]] (Lyon) and [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur]] (Marseille).

Among the 802,000 newborns in metropolitan France in 2010, 27.3% had one or both parents foreign-born, and about one quarter (23.9%) had one parent or both born outside of Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=ir-sd20101 Naissances selon le pays de naissance des parents 2010], Insee,  septembre 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Parents born in overseas territories are considered as born in France.&lt;/ref&gt; Including grandparents, about 40% of newborns in France between 2006 and 2008 had at least one foreign-born grandparent (11% born in another European country, 16% born in Maghreb but some have European ancestry and 12% born in another region of the world).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/FPORSOC11d_VE22Immig.pdf Les immigrés, les descendants d'immigrés et leurs enfants], Pascale Breuil-Genier, Catherine Borrel, Bertrand Lhommeau, Insee 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

France's population dynamics began to change in the middle of the 19th century, as France joined the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The pace of industrial growth attracted millions of European [[immigrants]] over the next century, with especially large numbers arriving from [[Poland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. III. French Government and the Refugees]''". American Philosophical Society, James E. Hassell (1991). p.22. {{ISBN|0-87169-817-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[First World War]], in which France suffered six million casualties, significant numbers of workers from French colonies came. By 1930, the Paris region alone had a North African Muslim population of 70,000.&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, ''Anti-Imperial Metropolis'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1974===
Right after the [[Second World War]], immigration to France significantly increased. During the period of reconstruction, France lacked labor, and as a result, the French government was eager to recruit immigrants coming from all over Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.

Although there was a presence of, [[Vietnamese people in France|Vietnamese in France]] since the late 19th century (mostly students and workers), a wave of Vietnamese migrated to the country after the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and the [[Geneva Accords (1954)|Geneva Accords]], which granted [[Vietnam]] its independence from France in 1954. These migrants consisted of those who were loyal to the colonial government and those married to French colonists. Following the [[partition of Vietnam]], students and professionals from [[South Vietnam]] continued to arrive in France. Although many initially returned to the country after a few years, as the [[Vietnam War]] situation worsened, a majority decided to remain in France and brought their families over as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw a significant wave of immigrants from [[Algeria]]. As the [[Algerian War]] started in 1954, there were already 200,000 Algerian immigrants in France.&lt;ref name="histoire-immigration.fr"&gt;"Le film : deux siècles d'histoire de l'immigration en France." http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/histoire-de-l-immigration/le-film&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the tension between the Algerians and the French, these immigrants were no longer welcome. This conflict between the two sides led to the [[Paris massacre of 1961|Paris Massacre]] of 17 October 1961, when the police used force against an Algerian demonstration on the streets of Paris. After the war, after Algeria gained its independence, the free circulation between France and Algeria was once again allowed, and the number of Algerian immigrants started to increase drastically. From 1962 to 1975, the Algerian immigrant population increased from 350,000 to 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;"En 1962, lors de l’Indépendance, ils sont 350 000. En 1975 les émigrants algériens sont 710 000 et constituent le deuxième groupe d’étrangers après les Portugais." "De 1945 à 1975." {{cite web |url=http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/dix-themes-pour-connaitre-deux-siecles-d-histoire-de-l-immigration/emigrer/de-1945-a-1975 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912030132/http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/dix-themes-pour-connaitre-deux-siecles-d-histoire-de-l-immigration/emigrer/de-1945-a-1975 |archivedate=12 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these immigrants were known as the "[[harki]]s," and the others were known as the "[[Pied-Noir|pieds-noirs]]." The "harkis" were Algerians who supported the French during the Algerian War; once the war was over, they were deeply resented by other Algerians, and thus had to flee to France. The "pieds-noirs" were Europeans settlers who moved to Algeria, but migrated back to France since 1962 when Algeria declared independence.

Additionally, the number of Pakistani and Japanese immigrants also increased during this period. There was also a great number of students and workers from former French colonies in Africa.

With this massive influx of immigrants, France became an asylum for refugees. According to the convention in Geneva, refugee status was granted to four out of five immigrant applicants. Many of these refugees came from countries in Eastern Europe (i.e. [[Hungary]]) and Latin America, because they feared the dictatorship in their home countries.

Although the majority of immigrants at this time came from rural regions, only 6% of them were willing to work in agriculture. About two-third of the immigrants worked in mining, steel, construction, and automotive industries. Approximately 12% of male immigrants and the majority of female immigrants worked in domestic services, restoration, and commerce (as for French women, a woman working was subject to her husband's authorisation until 1965&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elle.fr/Societe/Le-travail/Faire-bouger-les-choses/Il-y-a-50-ans-les-femmes-pouvaient-enfin-travailler-sans-l-accord-de-leur-mari-2968708&lt;/ref&gt;.) Minor and aged immigrants usually worked in craftsmanship and small scale trades.&lt;ref name="histoire-immigration.fr"/&gt;

===1974–present===
During the 1970s, France simultaneously faced economic crisis and allowed immigrants (mostly from the [[Muslim World]]) to permanently [[Family reunification|settle in France with their families]] and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims, especially to the larger cities, living in subsidized public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad and Michael J. Balz, "The October Riots in France: A Failed Immigration Policy or the Empire Strikes Back?" ''International Migration'' (2006) 44#2 pp 23–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this, France renounced its policy of [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], instead pursuing a policy of [[Social integration|integration]].&lt;ref name="migrationpolicy.org"&gt;Sylvia Zappi, "French Government Revives Assimilation Policy", in ''Migration Policy Institute'' [http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/french-government-revives-assimilation-policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130222428/http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/french-government-revives-assimilation-policy |date=30 January 2015 }} October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==The immigrant population==

In 2014 The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE, for its acronym in French) published a study, accordingly the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012 has doubled.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2014/11/28/qui-sont-les-nouveaux-immigres-qui-vivent-en-france-1751452-705.php|title=Qui sont les nouveaux immigrés qui vivent en France ?|website=sudouest.fr|language=fr|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As determined by the French Institute, this increase resulting from the [[European debt crisis|financial crisis]] that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans settled in France.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;
Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5300 to 11,000 people.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20minutos.es"&gt;{{cite news|title=El número de inmigrantes españoles en Francia se ha duplicado con la crisis|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2309684/0/inmigrantes-espanoles/en-francia-duplicado/con-la-crisis/|accessdate=26 June 2015|publisher=20minutos.es|date=28 November 2014|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the total of 229,000 new foreigners coming to France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, British 5%, Spanish 5%, Italians 4%, Germans 4%, Romanians 3%, and Belgians 3%.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hispantv.com"&gt;http://hispantv.com/detail.aspx?id=298807  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205043635/http://hispantv.com/detail.aspx?id=298807 |date=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase of Spanish, Portuguese and Italians in France, the weight of European immigrants arrived in 2012 to 46 percent, while this percentage for African reached 30%, with a presence in Morocco (7%), Algeria (7%) and Tunisia (3%).
Meanwhile, 14 percent of all immigrants who settled in France that year were from Asian countries - 3% of China and 2% in Turkey, while in America and Oceania constitute 10% of Americans and Brazilians accounted for higher percentage, 2 percent each.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hispantv.com"/&gt;

In 2008, according to The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE, for its acronym in French), there were 12 million immigrants and their direct descendants (2nd generation) making up about 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=IMMFRA12_b_VE_posfra Les descendants d'immigrés plus nombreux que les immigrés : une position française originale en Europe], The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE) 2012&lt;/ref&gt; with an immigrant defined as a foreign born person without French citizenship at birth. Without considering citizenship at birth,  people not born in metropolitan France and their direct descendants made up 30% of the population aged 18–50 in metropolitan France in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/45660/telechargement_fichier_fr_dt168.13janvier11.pdf Enquête sur la diversité des populations en France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626043740/http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/45660/telechargement_fichier_fr_dt168.13janvier11.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}, The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE) 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, there were 5.3 million immigrants corresponding to 8.5% of the total population in France (63.9 million in 2008). 42% were from Africa (30% from Maghreb and 12% from Sub-Saharan Africa), 38% from Europe (mainly from Portugal, Italy and Spain), 14% from Asia and 5% from the Americas and Oceania.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Of this total, 40% have assumed French citizenship.  In addition, 1.8 million people born in foreign countries (including 1 million in Maghreb) with French citizenship at birth were not included in this total.

There were also 6.7 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) living in France in 2008, corresponding to 11% of the total population in France. Immigrants aged 18–50 count for 2,7 millions (10% of population aged 18–50) and 5.3 millions for all ages (8% of population). 2nd Generation aged 18–50 make up 3.1 millions (12% of 18-50) and 6.5 millions for all ages (11% of population).&lt;ref name="insee.fr"/&gt; The regions with the largest proportion of immigrants and direct descendants of immigrants are the [[Île-de-France]] and [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]/[[Languedoc-Roussillon]], where more than one third and one quarter of the inhabitants respectively were either immigrants or direct descendants of immigrants.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The table shows immigrants and 2nd generation immigrants by origin in 2008. 3rd generation immigrants, illegal immigrants, as well as ethnic minorities like Black people from the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|French overseas territories]] residing in metropolitan France (800,000), [[Romani people|Roms]] (500,000) or people born in Maghreb with French citizenship at birth (about 4 million [[History of the Jews in France|Maghrebi Jews]], [[Harkis]] and [[Pied-Noir]] including their descendants live in France&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/election-presidentielle-2012/les-harkis-montrent-les-dents-24-01-2012-1423117_324.php Les harkis montrent les dents], [[Le Point]], 24 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) were not taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=IMMFRA12_g_Flot1_pop Fiches thématiques - Population immigrée - Immigrés - Insee Références - Édition 2012], Insee 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europeans===
In 2014 The National Institute of Statistics (INSEE, for its acronym in French) published a study on Thursday, according to which has doubled the number of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants in France between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;
According to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;
Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5300 to 11,000 people.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20minutos.es"/&gt;
Of the total of 229,000 foreigners arriving to France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, British 5%, Spanish 5%, Italians 4%, Germans 4%, Romanians 3%, and Belgians 3%.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hispantv.com"/&gt;

With the increase of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants to France, the weight of European immigrants arrived in 2012 to 46 percent, while this percentage for African reached 30%, with a presence in Morocco (7%), Algeria (7%) and Tunisia (3%).
Meanwhile, 14 percent of all immigrants who settled in France that year were from Asian countries—3% of China and 2% in Turkey, while in America and Oceania constitute 10% of Americans and Brazilians accounted for higher percentage, 2 percent each.&lt;ref name="sudouest.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hispantv.com"/&gt;

===Maghrebis===
French of [[Maghrebis in France|Maghrebi]] (either [[Arabs in France|Arabs]] or [[Berbers in France|Berbers]]) origin in France form the largest ethnic group after French of European origin.

According to [[Michel Tribalat]],  a researcher at [[Institut national d'études démographiques|INED]], there were 3.5 million people of Maghrebi origin (with at least one grandparent from Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia) living in [[France]] in 2005 corresponding to 5.8% of the total French metropolitan population (60.7 millions in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Tribalat, [http://eps.revues.org/index3657.html « Mariages « mixtes » et immigration en France »], Espace populations sociétés [En ligne], 2009/2 | 2009, mis en ligne le 01 avril 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Maghrebis have settled mainly in the industrial regions in France, especially in the [[Île-de-France (region)|Paris region]]. Many famous French people like [[Edith Piaf]],&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Burke. ''No Regrets: The Life of Edith Piaf'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RNKhl9_rm_EC&amp;pg=PA5 p.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Arnaud Montebourg]], [[Alain Bashung]], [[Dany Boon]], [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Karim Benzema]]  have Maghrebi ancestry.

Below is a table of population of Maghrebi origin in France, numbers are in thousands:

In 2005, the percentage of young people under 18 of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent) were about 7% in [[Metropolitan France]], 12% in [[Île-de-France (region)|Greater Paris]], 13% in [[Lyon]], 21% in [[Perpignan]], 22% in French [[Departments of France|département]] of [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], 37% in [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] and 40% in several arrondissements of [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Tribalat, ''Revue Commentaire'', juin 2009, n°126, p.436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Tribalat, ''Les yeux grands fermés'', Denoël, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

16% of newborns in France between 2006 and 2008 have at least one Maghrebi grandparent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

According to other sources between 5 and 6 million people of Maghrebi origin live in France corresponding to about 7-9% of the total French metropolitan population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Castel]], ''La discrimination négative'', Paris, La République des idées/Seuil, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal immigration==
[[Illegal immigration]] to France has developed as the country's immigration policy has become more rigid. In 2006, The French Ministry of the Interior estimated clandestine immigrants ("sans-papiers ") in France numbered anywhere between 200,000 and 400,000, also expecting between 80,000 and 100,000 people to enter the country illegally each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/076/article_43041.asp|title=RFI  - Immigration - Combien d’immigrés clandestins en France?|work=rfi.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, 28,000 illegal immigrants were expelled from France. The French government set a goal of 35,000 for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= We kicked out more illegal immigrants than ever before in 2011: France reveals it deported 33,000 people in just 12 months|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=10 January 2012|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2084790/France-reveals-deported-33-000-people-just-12-months.html#ixzz1qtU41BqC|accessdate=1 April 2012|location=London|first=Rebecca|last=Seales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= France to increase expulsions of illegal immigrants   |work=Le Figaro|date=02/08/2011|url= http://plus.lefigaro.fr/note/illegal-immigration-expulsions-will-accelerate-20110802-522043|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, many undocumented immigrants tried to jump the fences at [[Calais]] and board a train or truck heading for Britain. The [[Home Office]] has agents working alongside French police and immigration agents to prevent unauthorized people from entering the British border zone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33267137 Calais migrants: How is the UK-France border policed?] BBC, 3 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship==

Children born in France to foreign parents are automatically granted [[French citizenship]] upon reaching the age of 18. People born abroad and living in France can acquire [[French citizenship]] if they satisfy certain conditions. In 2009 the number of naturalised persons was 135,000, mainly from Maghreb (41.2%).

'''Irantxe''' (Iranxe, Iranshe), also known as '''Münkü''' (Mỹky), is an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American language]] that is spoken in [[Mato Grosso]], [[Brazil]], by about 200 people. It is generally left [[Unclassified language|unclassified]] due to lack of data. The most recent descriptions treat it as a [[language isolate]], saying that it "bears no similarity with other language families" (Arruda 2003), though this may not be based on new data (Monserrat 2010).

Monserrat (2010) is a well-reviewed grammar.

== Status ==
As of 2011, the 280 Irantxe (Iránxe, Iranche, Manoki, Munku) have largely assimilated to Brazilian culture. Most are monolingual in Portuguese, and the remaining Irantxe speakers are over 50 years old. A splinter group, the Mỹky (Mynky, Münkü, Munku, Menku, Kenku, Myy), however, moved to escape assimilation, and were isolated until 1971. As of 2011, there were 80 ethnic Mỹky, all of whom spoke the language.&lt;ref name="e21"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Monserrat posits a series of palatalized stops. For several reasons, however, reviewer D’Angelis (2011) suggests these are simply /Cj/ sequences.

{|class="wikitable IPA"
!
![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]
![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
![[Velar consonant|Velar]]
![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]

|-
![[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
| ||s
||| ||h
|-
![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
|w||l~r
|j||
|}
/m/ is optionally [mb] word initially, especially among the Irantxe: ''muhu'' [mbuhu], ''mjehy'' [mbjɛhɨ]. /s/ is pronounced [ʃ] before /j/. [r] and [l] are in free variation.

There are 28 vowels: Seven qualities, {{IPA|/i ɨ u ɛ ə ɔ a/}}, all appear long, short, and nasalized. The schwa, however, alternates with /ɛ/ in many words.

Syllables may be CjVC, though words may not end in a consonant. The role of tone is not clear.

[[Image:Haut de la Garenne Saint Martin Jersey 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Side view of Haut de la Garenne in 2008 - part of the façade is boarded up following the forensic excavations in the building]]
The '''Jersey child abuse investigation 2008''' is an investigation into historic [[child abuse]] in [[Jersey]]. It started in the spring of 2007. Before that, social worker Simon Bellwood had made a complaint about a "'[[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]]' system" where children as young as 11 were routinely locked up for 24 hours or more in solitary confinement in a secure unit where he worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2007/09/07/105628/exclusive-uk-social-worker-blows-the-whistle-on-jersey.htm "Social worker blows the whistle on Jersey" article], 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The wider investigation into child abuse over several decades became public in November that year. It received international attention when police moved into [[Haut de la Garenne]], then being used as a [[hostel|youth hostel]].

==Investigation==
A wide-ranging government investigation into [[child abuse]] had begun in 2006, and escalated into a [[States of Jersey Police]] investigation in 2007 during which witness evidence repeatedly indicated Haut de la Garenne, which housed up to 60 children at any one time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | date = 3 March 2008

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be one of the places where abuse took place.&lt;ref name="bbc080224"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-02-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was widespread media coverage as [[Forensic science|forensic]] teams conducted searches in the building between the end of February 2008 and July 2008.&lt;ref name="thisisjersey.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2008/07/09/the-work-is-over-at-haut-de-la-garenne/ |title=The work is over at Haut de la Garenne « This Is Jersey |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial finding of a fragment of what was believed to be a child's skull was widely publicised, but forensic tests later confirmed that the finding was irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisisjersey.com/news/shownewsarticle.pl?ArticleID=101244 ''Skull fragment "may be red herring"'']{{dead link|date=October 2012}}, Jersey Evening Post 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It later transpired that the forensic team had informed the police prior to the announcement of the discovery of supposed human remains that the item might predate the inquiry timeframe, being from infill from a graveyard or of prehistoric origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 States of Jersey Police sent the fragment to [[Kew Gardens]] in the UK for testing. In May 2009 the Kew experts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2010/Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20HA%20re%20skull%20fragment%20at%20Haut%20de%20la%20Garenne.pdf |title=Deputy of St Martin to HA re skull fragment at Haut de la Garenne |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the fragment was a piece of [[endocarp]] of ''[[Cocos nucifera]]'', i.e. a piece of coconut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By the end of the excavations and investigations at Haut de la Garenne in July 2008,&lt;ref name="thisisjersey.com"/&gt; police had sifted over 150 tonnes of earth. 65 human [[milk teeth]] were found, coming from between 10 and 65 individuals aged between 6–12 years and generally seeming to have been shed naturally. Discounting a large quantity of animal bones, only three bone fragments (the largest 25&amp;nbsp;mm = 1&amp;nbsp;inch long) were identified as possibly human; two of them have been dated to a range from 1470 to 1650 and the other 1650 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7267632.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Digging deep at Haut de la Garenne |publisher=BBC News |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change of investigation team ===

In September 2008, Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of [[Lancashire Police]] took over as [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Senior Investigating Officer]] in the abuse enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7585109.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Officer to lead abuse inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=27 August 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008 David Warcup, Deputy Chief Constable of [[Northumbria Police]], took over as Deputy Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police. The new team launched a review of the investigation to date.

In November 2008, the Deputy Chief Officer, David Warcup, expressed "much regret" that misleading information had been released throughout the conduct of the enquiry, although this has been bitterly contested. Warcup stated that there was "no evidence" of any child murders at Haut de la Garenne, although the ''Sunday Times'' and other media have pointed out that the original investigation had also made this point, nor was there any indication that bodies may have been destroyed at the property. He said that initial reports of blood spots, secret underground chambers, mysterious pits, and metal restraint [[shackle]]s, were all innocuous or misidentified.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7724622.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jersey chief officer is suspended | date=12 November 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, BBC television personality [[Jimmy Savile]] started legal proceedings against ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper which had, wrongly he claimed, linked him in several articles to the [[Child sexual abuse|child abuse]] scandal at Haut de la Garenne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/jimmy-savile-turns-to-fox-hayes-for-action-against-the-sun/131780.article|title=Jimmy Savile turns to Fox Hayes for action against The Sun|publisher=The Lawyer|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savile initially denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted that he had done so, following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Richard|last1=Alleyne|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9583373/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-He-raped-me-as-a-teenager-claims-woman.html|title=Sir Jimmy Savile: He raped me as a teenager claims woman|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey Police]] said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-19802630|title=Jimmy Savile named in Jersey children's home abuse inquiry|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|hundreds of people from all over the UK]] came forward to accuse him of past abuse. Several people from Haut de la Garenne also came forward at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-19954351 Jimmy Savile accused of Jersey abuse by a total of five people], 15 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214899/Lenny-Harper-Jimmy-Savile-implicated-Haut-la-Garenne-childrens-home-scandal.html Former Jersey police chief says Jimmy Savile was implicated in Haut de la Garenne children's home scandal and there's 'no reason to doubt' he abused girls there],  Leon Watson, Daily Mail (UK), 8 October 2012, retr 2012 10 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the deceased actor [[Wilfrid Brambell]] was accused of abusing two boys aged 12–13 during the 1970s in Jersey. One of the boys was from the [[Haut de la Garenne]] children's home.&lt;ref name=Raynor2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Jimmy Savile: Steptoe and Son actor Wilfrid Brambell 'abused boys in Jersey' claims whistleblower |last1=Rayner |first1=Gordon|last2=Fairweather |first2=Eileen |date=17 October 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9616121/Jimmy-Savile-Steptoe-and-Son-actor-Wilfrid-Brambell-abused-boys-in-Jersey-claims-whistleblower.html |quote=One of the alleged victims was a resident at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children’s home which was at the centre of a high-profile police investigation into historical child abuse on the island in 2008.

==Charges==
Jersey Police have so far recorded claims of abuse from 100 people.&lt;ref name="bbc080416"&gt;{{cite news

However the police have stated that there will not be the number of prosecutions which were originally reported, and Detective Superintendent Gradwell stated in August 2009 that the problems with the handling of the inquiry before he took over had "generated a very high level of expectation among complainants and the public" that "a large number of people would be prosecuted".&lt;ref name="Diane Simon"&gt;{{cite news

==Trials==
In May 2009, Michael Aubin, then 46, admitted&lt;ref&gt;12 May 2009, in a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article "ex-resident Michael Aubin guilty of child abuse"&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Royal Court of Jersey]] two counts of gross indecency and two counts of indecent assault on children under 10 years old while he himself was a child resident of Haut de la Garenne. He was sentenced on 22 June 2009 to two years' probation, having spent 19 months on [[Detention of suspects|remand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/06/22/abused-boy-turned-abuser/ |title=Abuser sentenced to probation « This Is Jersey |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was presided over by Royal Court [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] Julian Clyde-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/exresident-michael-aubin-spared-jail-for-jersey-childrens-home-abuse-1712587.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Ex-resident Michael Aubin spared jail for Jersey children's home abuse | first=Jamie | last=Grierson | date=22 June 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Gordon Claude Wateridge, then 78, was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault and one count of assault but acquitted on 11 counts of indecent assault and one count of incitement to indecent assault, all relating to his time as a house parent at Haut de la Garenne in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8266897.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Jail for Jersey home sex attacker |publisher=BBC News |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Court [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] Sir Christopher Pitchers, presiding, warned Wateridge to expect a custodial sentence for such a "breach of trust".&lt;ref&gt;"Haut de la Garenne: Ex-house parent guilty on eight abuse charges", Jersey Evening Post, 21 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September Wateridge was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment by the Inferior Number of the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/21/carer-jersey-jailed-sexual-assaults |title=Former carer at Jersey children's home jailed for sexual assaults &amp;#124; UK news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 21 September 2009|accessdate=2012-10-02 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Claude Donnelly, then 69, was sentenced by the Superior Number of [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] to a total of 15 years in prison after two trials in May 2009 and June 2009 for offences against young girls between 1968 and 1982. These offences were unconnected to Haut de la Garenne. He was convicted in May 2009 on one count of rape and three counts of indecent assault and in June 2009 on ten counts of indecent assault, four counts of rape and one count of procuring an act of gross indecency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/8214294.stm | work=BBC News | title=Child rapist jailed for 15 years | date=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Court Commissioner Sir Christopher Pitchers, presiding, said that the abuse had had a terrible effect on Donnelly's victims, and that the substantial period of imprisonment recommended by the Attorney General was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 2010, Morag and Anthony Jordan, a married couple who worked as house parents at Haut de la Garenne during the 1970s, were convicted of eight separate counts relating to physical abuse and subsequently received jail terms of nine and six months. Morag Jordan was acquitted of a further 28 counts and her husband of four. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/06/jersey-care-home-assaults-couple-jailed&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the investigation==
There have been criticisms of the original investigation at Haut de la Garenne, both in Jersey and elsewhere.

The former minister for health and social services, Senator [[Stuart Syvret]], said that he had been made aware in early 2007 of abuse at the home and had called for an independent enquiry. [[Frank Walker (Jersey politician)|Frank Walker]], the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]], accused him of damaging Jersey's reputation by speaking to the media,&lt;ref&gt;

The Attorney General, who has the responsibility for prosecutions, stated that "justice should be done" in spite of delays in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7536536.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jersey chief confident on inquiry | date=1 August 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Kingdom [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]] said that he thought that there was no doubt that there were efforts to [[cover up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7534350.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jersey murder inquiry 'unlikely' | date=31 July 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Senator Syvret sought permission to apply for a judicial review of UK [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]]'s decision not to intervene over the prosecution of historic child abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7536000/7536679.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hopes of justice on Jersey | date=1 August 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010 | first=Sanchia | last=Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called for [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|UK government intervention]] and assurance that cases were heard outside Jersey, on the grounds that Jersey's legal system could not guarantee a fair trial of an inquiry of this scale. At a hearing before the High Court in London in March 2009, the application for judicial review was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/03/18/abuse-inquiry-senators-high-court-bid-fails/ |title=Abuse inquiry: Senator’s High Court bid fails « This Is Jersey |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism intensified after the November 2008 withdrawal by police of claims of evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1086018/How-police-chief-Lenny-Harper-lost-plot-Jersey-childrens-home-murders.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=How police chief Lenny Harper lost the plot over the Jersey children's home 'murders' | date=15 November 2008 | first=David | last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the investigation being described variously as "farcical"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1084985/4m-Jersey-House-Horrors-investigation-shut-police-chiefs-admit-NO-children-murdered.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=£4m Jersey 'House of Horrors' investigation shut down after police chiefs admit NO children were murdered in care home | first1=Andrew | last1=Malone | first2=Arthur | last2=Martin | date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "shambles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5142126.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Evidence of murders at children's home on Jersey dismissed | date=13 November 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010 | first=Simon | last=de Bruxelles}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that those leading the enquiry had leaped too readily to conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-where-nightmares-lurk-1015512.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Leading article: Where nightmares lurk | date=13 November 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance on indications given by the same [[sniffer dogs]] criticised in connection with the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]] was also questioned.&lt;ref&gt;"A nose for trouble", [[Private Eye]], 28 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police, Graham Power, was suspended in November 2008 pending an inquiry into his handling of the case, in particular into his release of preliminary findings to the press.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Defence advocates for Aubin, Wateridge and Donnelly argued in pre-trial proceedings that inaccurate and sensational publicity surrounding the inquiry would seriously adversely affect the cases against their clients, and that there had been political pressure to bring charges. Royal Court Commissioner Sir Christopher Pitchers (a retired [[High Court of England and Wales]] judge appointed to preside over the trials of Wateridge and Donnelly) rejected the defence applications to halt proceedings and permitted the prosecutions to continue, despite what he described as the way in which the senior investigating officer "whipped up a frenzied interest in the inquiry", as he believed that the November 2008 statements by States of Jersey Police that there had been no child murders had done much to mitigate the effects of earlier publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Detective Superintendent Gradwell retired in August 2009 at the end of his contract and returned to the UK. On retiring, he described the investigation prior to the time he took over as a "poorly managed mess" and, in particular, the decision to excavate at Haut de la Garenne as being without justification and as "a complete and total waste of public money, time and effort".&lt;ref name="Diane Simon"/&gt; In September 2009, Lenny Harper published a point-by-point counterblast to these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ex-Senator Stuart Syvret |url=http://stuartsyvret.blogspot.com/2011/02/lenny-harper-witness-for-historic.html |title=Lenny Harper: A witness for the historic record |publisher=Stuartsyvret.blogspot.com |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into inquiry==

In 2011, [[Leah McGrath Goodman]], an American journalist, claimed that she was banned from re-entering either the United Kingdom or the Bailiwick of Jersey for a period of two years, whilst in the middle of undertaking research on the abuse allegations. The alleged ban was then reportedly reduced subsequently to one year, after the intervention of John Hemming, a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|the Westminster Parliament in the United Kingdom]], and others. In September 2012, [[Trevor Pitman]], one of the Deputies for the Parish of [[St Helier|Saint Helier]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sthelier.je/elected-members/deputies/ Your Parish Online, St Helier], retr 2012 9 13 from sthelier.je&lt;/ref&gt; started a campaign and a petition-drive to lift her ban from the UK and Jersey, so that she could be granted a new visa and work permit and finish her investigative work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2012-13/504 Early day motion 504], UK Parliament, Session: 2012-13, Date tabled: 11.09.2012, Primary sponsor: Hemming, John.

==New inquiry, 2013==
A new major inquiry headed by Sally Bradley QC, a [[High Court of England and Wales#Judges|Deputy Judge]] of the [[High Court of England and Wales]], was announced in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-22878249 |title=Judge chosen for Jersey child abuse committee of inquiry |work=BBC News |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The start of the inquiry was delayed when Sally Bradley became ill soon after her appointment and she was replaced by Frances Oldham QC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-28423082 |title=Timeline:Jersey's decades of abuse |work=BBC News |date=7 August 2014 |access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inquiry presented its report in July 2017.

The '''Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority''' (KACA) of [[Kenya]] was established in 1997 after the amendment of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 65, LOK) in early 1997. The first director was [[John Harun Mwau]] who was appointed in December 1997.  In April 2003, it was replaced by the [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] KACC which was subsequently replaced by the [[Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission]] (EACC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704061611/http://www.eacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid=2 |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Kurds}}
'''Kurdish culture''' is a group of distinctive [[cultural]] traits practiced by [[Kurdish people]]. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society.

Kurds or Kurds are people living in western Asia in the north of the Middle East along the Zacros Mountains and the Taurus Mountains in the region that the Kurds call Greater Kurdistan. Today they are parts of north-eastern Iraq, north-west of Iran and north East of Syria and southeast Turkey. In addition to these areas, the Kurds are present in a few numbers in south-western Armenia and some areas of Azerbaijan and Lebanon. Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups that does not have an independent state or a unified political entity recognized universally. There is a lot of controversy about the Kurdish people from their origins, their history, and even their political future. This historical controversy has intensified in recent years, especially after the changes in the reality of the Kurds in Iraq following the Second Gulf War, and the formation of the United States of the no-fly zone that led to the emergence of the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq.

==Language==
[[File:Central Kurdish branch.png]]
{{Main article|Kurdish languages}}
Kurdish (کوردی, Kurdî) is part of the North-Western division of the Iranian branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].Basic languages: sorani and kurmanji
In various forms: Sorani, Armenian, Vile, Southern Kurdish, Royal, Zacakian, Bajelian, and Gorani
Other languages: Arabic, Turkish, Persian
&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kurds, A Concise Handbook|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2009|isbn=0844817279|location=Abingdon, Oxford|pages=167|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 30 million speakers of Kurdish in the Kurdistan region. Kurdish is written in the Arabic alphabet in Iraq and Syria, the adapted Arabic alphabet in Iran and the Latin script in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vcxVDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128&amp;lpg=PT128&amp;dq=How+many+Kurdish+speakers+30+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TIPX7zGGbi&amp;sig=kntL7KxW7DeATUkoRJql-dWXq6w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrzNjBrfzSAhXmL8AKHeVaAmIQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20many%20Kurdish%20speakers%2030%20million&amp;f=false|title=Middle East Patterns: Places, People, and Politics|last=Held|first=Colbert C.|last2=Cummings|first2=John Thomas|date=2013-12-03|publisher=Avalon Publishing|isbn=9780813348780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are both part of the same language family, according to Izady, "Many Kurdish words are cognate to English, such as gama = game, mâra = marry, stâra = star, rubâr = river, dol = dale or valley, brâ = brother, mong = moon, snoy = snow, firo = free (of charge), standin = to stand, sur = sure, and the like."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three main dialects: [[Northern Kurdish|Kurmanji]], [[Central Kurdish|Soriani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDowall|first1=David|title=A Modern History of the Kurds: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=I.B.Tauris|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=en|date=14 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Kurdish|Pehlewani]].

==Music==
{{Main article|Kurdish music}}
Kurdish folk music is an important part of Kurdish culture and has traditionally been used to transmit stories about Kurdish history by [[Dengbej]] (bards). According to thekurdishproject.org, 'The word ‘deng’ means voice and ‘bej’ means ‘to sing.’ Dengbej are best known for their “stran,” or song of mourning.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thekurdishproject.org/history-and-culture/kurdish-culture/|title=Kurdish Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=thekurdishproject.org|publisher=The Kurdish Project|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular Kurdish musicians of the 20th century like [[Hassan Zirak]] and [[Ahmet Kaya]] sang in Turkish or [[Persian language|Persian]] as well as in Kurdish. Apart from the language it is sung in, Western Kurdish music has a more Anatolian, Turkish, Greek or Balkan sound, whereas Southern Kurdish music is influenced by Arab musical styles, Eastern Kurdish music by Persian styles and North-Eastern by Armenian and Caucasian styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I9mr6OgLjBoC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=kurdish+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0sLEdvhpJl&amp;sig=mydiNEwstf-jsSbC9MWFdQlW1tE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf8f6zzubPAhWJC8AKHc4DCZI4ChDoAQhAMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=kurdish%20music&amp;f=false|title=The Kurds: A Concise Handbook|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad R.|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0844817279|location=|pages=268|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Kurdish cuisine}}

Food is widely recognised to be a fundamental part of what it means to be Kurdish. Foods such as [[Yapraxi galamew]] (rice stuffed in grape leaves), kfta (spiced minced meat cased in thin layer of mashed pudding rice), Ser u pe (goats head, tongue and feet), shifta (meat patties),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventuressheart.com/2011/08/shfta-kurdish-meat-patties.html|title=Shfta - Kurdish meat patties|website=www.adventuressheart.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; are traditional [[Kurdish food]]s. Lamb and chicken have been staple meats in Kurdish cuisine for centuries. Vegetables, pilaf and dairy products also comprise a large portion of traditional Kurdish food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thekurdishproject.org/history-and-culture/kurdish-culture/kurdish-food/|title=Learn About Kurdish Food {{!}} The Kurdish Project|newspaper=The Kurdish Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea is also staple to a Kurdish diet. It is commonly drunk 2-3 times a day, commonly a social activity. Kurds also drink Mastaw/Do'h/[[Ayran]], a yogurt-based drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cabinet.gov.krd/p/p.aspx?l=12&amp;s=020000&amp;r=311&amp;p=221|title=Kurdistan's cuisine|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{main article|Yazidism|Yarsanism|Yazdânism|Kurdish Jews|Kurdish Christians}}

The Kurdish people have different religions depending on the country in which they live in or they have cultural and ethnic links to that religion, the most common religion among Kurds is Sunni Islam, practiced by 98% of Kurds living in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. The Kurds of Turkey are 30% [[Alevism|Alevi]] out of a population of approximately 15-22 million Kurds and 68% follow Sunni Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/m.vanbruinessen/publications/Bruinessen_Religion_in_Kurdistan.pdf|title=Religion of the Kurds|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion has become a fundamental part of what it means to be a Kurd. The first known religion of the Kurds was [[Zoroastrianism]], an ancient Iranian religion. As Zoroastrianism was fading from the ancient areas of Mesopotamia and Anatolia [[Yazidis|Yezidism]] was becoming more accepted as the main religion of the Kurds in the Shingal area (Sinjar) the 12-13th Century and more Yezidi tribes expanded into South-eastern Anatolia. The areas where the Kurds consider their homeland have a wide variety of religions including Islam, Christianity and Judaism which have all at one point existed in the Kurdish areas. The Religion of the Kurds has been changing constantly throughout history.

'''Labor history''' or '''labour history''' is a sub-discipline of [[social history]] which specialises on the history of the [[working class]]es and the [[labor movement]]. The central concerns of labor historians include [[industrial relations]] and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of [[mass politics]] (especially the rise of [[socialism]]) and the social and cultural history of the [[Proletariat|industrial working classes]]. Labor historians may also concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from [[rural history]].

==Working-class movement==
Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as [[Luddism]] and [[Chartism]], the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this ''institutional'' approach included [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress. As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was "designed to service and celebrate the Labour movement."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Savage and Andrew Miles, ''The Remaking of the British Working Class, 1840-1940,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-07320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist influence==
{{Further|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Marxist historians}}

In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic:
:the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions’ [[winter of discontent]] [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the [[History of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like [[Raphael Samuel]] into the [[New Left Review]], a famous journal like [[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]], the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like [[Tony Benn]] joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan sees benefits: 
:In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labour and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, [[People's history|‘history from below’ so-called,]] and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the ‘condescension of posterity’; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Morgan tells of the downside as well:
: But the Marxist – or sometimes Trotskyist – emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissent–it was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff...when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt17w8h53.9.pdf?_=1467168515247 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history "from below" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963. {{ISBN|0-14-013603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for [[social history]] in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, [[C. L. R. James]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression ''within'' the working class.

Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers' organizations, and the "history from below" approach of the Marxist historians.

Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of [[social class|class]] itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a "language of class". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.

==United States==
{{Main article|Labor history of the United States}}
Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship  deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there's been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Walkowitz and Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, eds. ''Rethinking U.S. Labor History: Essays on the Working-Class Experience, 1756-2009'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas]]''.

==Historiography==
Kirk (2010) surveys labor historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Marxist orbit, social historians paid a good deal of attention to labour history as well.&lt;ref&gt;John McIlroy, "Asa Briggs and the Emergence of Labour History in Post-War Britain." ''Labour History Review'' 77.2 (2012): 211-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, "in sharp decline," because:
:there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. '' A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939-2000'' (2005) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main official '''languages of Finland''' are [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. There are also several official [[minority language]]s: three variants of [[Sami language|Sami]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]].

==Finnish==
[[Image:Languages of Finnish municipalities (2016).svg|thumb|right|200px|Municipalities of Finland: {{legend|#EEEEC1|unilingually Finnish}}{{legend|#37ABC8|bilingual with Finnish as majority language, Swedish as minority language}}{{legend|#0055D4|bilingual with Swedish as majority language, Finnish as minority language}}{{legend|#000080|unilingually Swedish}}{{legend|#800033|bilingual with Finnish as majority language, Sami as minority language}}]]
{{main|Finnish language}}
[[Finnish language|Finnish]] is the language of the majority, 91%&lt;ref name="population_by_language_2008"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://pxweb2.stat.fi/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=060_vaerak_tau_107_fi&amp;amp;ti=V%E4est%F6+kielen+mukaan+sek%E4+ulkomaan+kansalaisten+m%E4%E4r%E4+ja+maa%2Dpinta%2Dala+alueittain++1980+%2D+2007&amp;amp;path=../Database/StatFin/vrm/vaerak/&amp;amp;lang=3&amp;amp;multilang=fi | title = Population according to language and the number of foreigners and land area km2 by area | accessdate = 21 June 2009 | date = 2008-12-31 | work = Statistics Finland's PX-Web databases | publisher = Statistics Finland | location = Helsinki }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population. It is a [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]] closely related to [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and less closely to the [[Sami languages]]. The Finnic languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], so Finnish is distantly related to languages as diverse as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (a [[Ugric languages|Ugric language]]) and [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] (a [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic language]]) in [[Siberia]].

==Swedish==
{{main|Finland Swedish|Åland Swedish}}
[[Swedish language|Swedish]] is the main language of 5.5% of the population&lt;ref name="population_by_language_2008" /&gt; (92.4% in the [[Åland]] autonomous province), down from 14% at the beginning of the 20th century. In 2012, 44% of Finnish citizens with another registered primary language than Swedish could hold a conversation in this language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf Europeans and their languages, situationen 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |date=2016-01-06 }}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], closely related to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]. As a subbranch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], it is also closely related to other Germanic languages such as [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[English language|English]].

Swedish was the language of the administration until the late 19th century. Today it is one of the two main official languages, with a position equal to Finnish in most legislation, though the working language in most governmental bodies is Finnish. Both Finnish and Swedish are [[mandatory Swedish|compulsory subjects]] in school with an exception for children with a third language as their native language. A successfully completed language test is a prerequisite for governmental offices where a university degree is required.

The four largest Swedish-speaking communities in Finland, in absolute numbers, are those of [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Porvoo]] and [[Vaasa]], where they constitute significant minorities. Helsinki, the capital, had a Swedish-speaking majority until late in the 19th century. Currently {{pct|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Swedish|Helsinki}}|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|1 }} of the population of Helsinki are Swedish-speaking and 9.6% speaks languages other than Finnish and Swedish.{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Finnish}}&lt;!-- This creates a reference --&gt;

The Swedish dialects spoken in Finland mainland are known as [[Finland-Swedish]]. There is a rich Finland-Swedish literature, including authors such as [[Tove Jansson]], [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]], [[Edith Södergran]] and [[Zacharias Topelius]]. Runeberg is considered Finland's [[national poet]] and wrote the national anthem, "[[Maamme|Vårt land]]", which was only later translated to Finnish.

==Sami languages==
The [[Sami languages]] are a group of related languages spoken across [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. They are distantly related to Finnish. The three Sami languages spoken in Finland, [[Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], have a combined native speaker population of roughly 1,800.&lt;ref name="population_by_language_2008" /&gt;

==Karelian==
Up to [[World War II]], [[Karelian language|Karelian]] was spoken in the historical Border-[[Karelia]]n region on the northern shore of [[Lake Ladoga]]. After the war, immigrant Karelians were settled all over Finland. In 2001 the Karelian Language Society estimated that the language is understood by 11,000–12,000 people in Finland, most of whom are elderly. A more recent estimate is that the size of the language community is 30,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksml.fi/mielipide/mielipidekirjoitukset/karjalaa-osaavien-yhteiso-on-suuri/2065961|title=Karjalaa osaavien yhteisö on suuri|first=Ari|last=Burtsoff|website=Ksml.fi|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karelian was recognized in a regulation by the President in November 2009, in accordance with the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/sopimukset/sopsteksti/2009/20090068 Change in the regulation by the president of Finland about European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, 68/2009 27.11.2009] (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian ==
Although the older generations tend to know Russian as a third or fourth language in Finland due to previous Soviet influence over Europe, in the last decade or two Russian language is being replaced by English language, especially among the younger generations. Finland is placed among the top four countries in the world in terms of fluency of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finlandtoday.fi/finland-places-among-the-top-four-english-speaking-countries-in-the-world|title=Finland Places Among the Top Four English-Speaking Countries in the World - Finland Today|date=17 April 2015|website=Finlandtoday.fi|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian language is the third most spoken native language in Finland (1%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/series/volumes/05/evarieng-vol5.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Survey on the English Language in Finland : Uses, meanings and attitudes|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian language has no official status in Finland, though historically it served as the third co-official language with Finnish and Swedish for a relatively brief period between 1900 and 1917.

==Territorial bilingualism==
All municipalities outside [[Åland]] where both official languages are spoken by either at least 8% of the population or at least 3,000 people are considered bilingual. Swedish reaches these criteria in 59 out of 336 municipalities located in Åland (where this does not matter) and the coastal areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia region]], [[Southwest Finland]] (especially in [[Åboland]] outside [[Turku]]) and [[Uusimaa]].&lt; Outside these areas there are some towns with significant Swedish-speaking minorities not reaching the criteria. Thus the inland is officially unilingually Finnish-speaking. Finnish reaches the criteria everywhere but in Åland and in three municipalities in the [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia region]], which is also the only [[Regions of Finland|region]] on the Finnish mainland with a Swedish-speaking majority (52% to 46%).

The [[Sami languages]] have an official status in the northernmost Finland, in [[Utsjoki]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Enontekiö]] and part of [[Sodankylä]], regardless of proportion of speakers.

In the bilingual municipalities signs are in both languages, important documents are translated and authorities have to be able to serve in both languages. Authorities of the central administration have to serve the public in both official languages, regardless of location, and in Sami in certain circumstances.

Places often have different names in Finnish and in Swedish, both names being equally official as name of the town. For a list, see [[Names of places in Finland in Finnish and in Swedish]].

===''Emina''===
{{Main|Emina (poem)}}
''Emina'' was originally a poem written by [[Bosnian Serb]] poet [[Aleksa Šantić]], first published in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-volto-di-Santic-140066|title=Il volto di Šantić|publisher=Balcancaucaso|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a popular sevdalinka covered by many artists from the [[former Yugoslav]] republics over the course of the 20th century. The subject of the song is Šantić's teenage neighbor, a [[Bosniak]] girl named [[Emina Sefić]]. It is one of the most well-known sevdalinkas of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.dw.de/bolje-da-ne-peva%C5%A1/a-16941264|title=Bolje da ne pevaš|publisher=dw.de|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Un-sentimento-bosniaco.html|title=Un sentimento bosniaco|publisher=Girodivite|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://doznajemo.com/2012/11/22/zaboravljeni-junaci-jednog-vremena-20-himzo-polovina-niko-poput-njega-nije-pjevao-santicevu-eminu/ |title=Zaboravljeni junaci jednog vremena |publisher=doznajemo |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411084857/http://doznajemo.com/2012/11/22/zaboravljeni-junaci-jednog-vremena-20-himzo-polovina-niko-poput-njega-nije-pjevao-santicevu-eminu/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Sinoć kad se vraćah iz topla hamama, 
:''prođoh pokraj bašče staroga imama. 
:''Kad tamo u bašči, u hladu jasmina 
:''s ibrikom u ruci stajaše Emina.

:''Ja kakva je pusta! Tako mi imana, 
:''stid je ne bi bilo da je kod sultana. 
:''Pa još kada šeće i plećima kreće, 
:''ni hodžin mi zapis više pomoć' neće!

:''Ja joj nazvah selam. Al' moga mi dina, 
:''ne šće ni da čuje lijepa Emina, 
:''već u srebrn ibrik zahvatila vode, 
:''pa niz bašču đule zaljevati ode.

:''S grana vjetar puhnu, pa niz pleći puste 
:''rasplete joj njene pletenice guste. 
:''Zamirisa kosa, k'o zumbuli plavi, 
:''a meni se krenu bururet u glavi!

:''Malo ne posrnuh, mojega mi dina, 
:''al' meni ne dođe lijepa Emina. 
:''Samo me je jednom pogledala mrko, 
:''niti haje, alčak, što za njome crko'!

:''Last night, returning from the warm [[Turkish bath|hamam]]
:''I passed by the garden of the old [[Imam]]
:''And lo, in the garden, in the shade of a jasmine,
:''There with a pitcher in her hand stood Emina.

:''What beauty! By [[iman (concept)|iman]] I could swear,
:''She would not be ashamed if she were at the [[sultan]]’s!
:''And the way she walks and her shoulders move...
:''-- Not even an Imam’s amulet could help me!

:''I offered her [[S-L-M|salaam]], but by my [[dīn]],
:''Beautiful Emina would not even hear it.
:''Instead, scooping water in her silver pitcher,
:''Around the garden she went to water the roses.

:''A wind blew from the branches down her lovely shoulders
:''Unraveling those thick braids of hers.
:''Her hair gave off a scent of blue [[hyacinths]],
:''Making me giddy and confused!

:''I nearly stumbled, I swear by my faith,
:''But beautiful Emina did not come to me.
:''She only gave me a frowning look,
:''Not caring, the naughty one, that I am crazy for her!
|}
Many artists have covered the song, but the version by fellow Mostar native, Bosnian singer [[Himzo Polovina]], remains the most popular. Upon hearing of the death of Emina Sefić, Polovina went to poet Sevda Katica's home in the village of [[Donja Mahala]]. He found her in the yard of the family home, informed her of Emina's death and she shuddered with grief and spoke the verses:

:''Umro stari pjesnik, umrla Emina

:''pjesma o Emini, nikad umrijet neće.

:''The old poet has died, Emina has died
:''The empty garden of jasmine was left behind
:''The pitcher is broken
:''The flowers have withered

Polovina recorded the song and added Sevda's new verses.

Over the centuries, the song spread amongst the [[Slavic Muslims|Muslim]] populations in [[Podgorica]] and the [[Sandžak]] regions of [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60315">'''Media pluralism''' defines the state of having a plurality of voices, opinions and analyses on media system (internal pluralism) or the coexistence of different and diverse types of medias and media support (external pluralism).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-44/reporterssansfrontiers_18792.pdf "Contribution to the European Union public consultation on media pluralism and democracy", ''Reporters Without Borders'', July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media ownership: The economics and politics of convergence and concentration in the UK and European media.|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2002|isbn=9780761966814|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Media_pluralism_trends_2018.jpg|thumb|436x436px|Media pluralism trends 2018, UNESCO's World Trends Report]]
Media pluralism is often recognized by [[International organization|international organizations]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] as being an essential part of a [[Democracy|democratic]] state, [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers ''"access to a plurality of editorial lines and analyses [as] essential for citizens to be able to confront ideas, to make their own informed choices and to conduct their life freely"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Expanded access to the [[Internet]] and the [[Digital television transition|digital switch-over]] has enabled an increased availability of [[Content (media)|media content]], largely through sharing and [[user-generated content]] on [[social media]], in addition to the digital channels to which individuals have access across television and radio. The diversity of content is however accompanied by what [[Comparing Media Systems|Hallin and Mancini]] call polarized pluralism in a media system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|last=Hallin|first=Daniel C.|last2=Mancini|first2=Paolo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0521543088|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [[World Trends Report]], a sharper division in the way we use news is coming up due to the interaction between consumption habits, changing [[Economic model|economic models]] and technical systems. This signifies that even if multiple kinds of information and programming are available, each segmented group may only ingest one branch of the whole. The increase of Internet penetration and reliance on online sources for news is thought of to producing siloed debates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level, ‘[[Zero-rating|zero rating]]’— in which Internet or [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] allow users to access specific content or applications without counting towards the user’s data ‘cap’— expands in parallel to mobile uptakes, particularly in [[Emerging markets|emerging countries]]. Traditional business models for the news media continue to be disrupted, leading to vertical and horizontal concentration and introduction of new types of ownership. Challenges to media funding introduce new types of economic models such as [[Paywall|pay-walls]] and [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding]] initiatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Gender equality|Gender]] is a part of media pluralism and is characterized by the under-representation of [[Women in media|women in the media]] workforce, in [[decision-making]] and in media content. People with disabilities are also under-represented in the media system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/disability-and-the-media.html|title=Disability and the Media {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding media pluralism ==

* Pluralism means choice for media consumption and production, as distinct from monopolization of offerings and opportunities.
* Pluralism involves sensitivity to a variety of economic ownership models and a technical architecture of delivery in which multichannel and multi-platform distribution is available.
* Pluralism often resonates with strong commitments on behalf of governments to public service and community media to provide for diversity.

[[Karol Jakubowicz|Jakubowicz]] focuses on "provisions" or "supply" of media content and the impact of available information in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media Ecology: reconceptualizing media pluralism.

== Access ==
{{Main|Access to information}}Access to information, as the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively, is an aspect of media pluralism. It can include or allow "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “[[access to information]]”, “right to information”, “right to know” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Percentage_of_individuals_using_the_internet_2012-2017.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Percentage_of_individuals_using_the_internet_2012-2017.svg|thumb|419x419px|Percentage of individuals using the Internet 2012–2017]]

=== Internet and mobile ===
According to the World Trends Report, access to all types of media has increased between 2012 and 2017, but this is especially true for access to the Internet. International commitments such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]] and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion’ testify of this.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017a. Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates). World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators database. Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of Internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

==== Limitations ====
[[File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg|thumb|344x344px|Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012-2016]]
[[Mobile Web|Mobile Internet]] connectivity has an impact in expanding access. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the open web affords explorations beyond a user’s immediate range of interests, Mobile Internet has the singularity of creating siloed information spaces predisposing mobile users to access only a limited portion of the available information. [[Censorship]] and [[surveillance]] are also factors of media pluralism as they cause different experiences for users accessing the Internet in different States.

==== Zero-rating ====
The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017. Zero-rating in Emerging Economies. London: Chatham House. Available at https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20 no.47_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study led by the [[Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) of eight countries in the [[Global South]] found that zero-rated data plans exist in every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and actually used in each.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). 2015. Models of Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Research brief. The Impacts of Emerging Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Available at http://a4ai.org/the-impacts-of-emerging-mobile-data-services-in-developing-countries/ The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], found Facebook’s Free Basics and [[Wikipedia Zero]] to be the most commonly zero-rated content.&lt;ref&gt;Gillwald, Alison, Chenai Chair, Ariel Futter, Kweku Koranteng, Fola Odufuwa, and John Walubengo. 2016.

Available at https://www.researchictafrica.net/publications/Other_publications/2016_RIA_Zero-Rating_Policy_Paper_-_Much_ado_about_nothing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadcast media ===
[[File:Main_source_of_news_by_age.svg|thumb|248x248px|Main source of news by age]]
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In the Arab region, geopolitical interests has contributed to the growing reach of state-owned global news broadcasters and has determined the launching of Arabic-language channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Generational trends ====
Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the Internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A. L. Levy, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. 2017. Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20 web_0.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is reversed when it comes to [[Digital media|online media]], chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 per cent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller. 2016. Arab Youth Survey Middle East – Findings. Available at http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Digital transition ====
{{See also|Digital television transition}}Digital transition is the process in which older [[Analog TV|analog television]] [[broadcasting]] is converted to and replaced by [[digital television]].The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) has been mapping the progress in [[Digital television transition|digital switchovers]] across the globe. According to them, the switch from [[Analog television|analogue television]] to [[digital television]] has been completed in 56 countries in 2017, and was ongoing in 68, steadily increasing the range of channels to which individuals have access.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b. Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting: Figures. ITU Telecommunication Development Sector. Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Spectrum-Broadcasting/Pages/DSO/Default.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Status_of_the_transition_to_Digital_Terrestrial_Television_Broadcasting.svg|thumb|275x275px|Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting]]

==== Expansion strategies ====

* Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016. BBC World Service announces biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’. BBC News, sec. Entertainment &amp; Arts. Available at https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainmentarts-37990220. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as [[Streaming media|online streaming]] is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, [[Netflix]] experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the [[United States]], where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Advertising issues ====
Print media is continuously affected by changing trends in advertising: in 2012 its share of total news media revenues globally dropped below 50 per cent and continued falling to 38 per cent in 2016. Newspapers transition to online platforms increase the volume of revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]]. The main challenge that [[Newspaper|newspapers]] face, according to Cecilia Campbell, is how to capture more of the digital subscriptions and advertising growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Economic models ==
Media systems are built from a variety of economic models including mixes of [[Market economy|market]], [[public service]], [[community]] and [[State-owned enterprise|state entities]]. A plurality of media owners and economic models serves as an essential element of external pluralism, guaranteed by competition in the market. Nonprofit public service and [[community media]] can help achieve internal pluralism by incorporating social and [[cultural diversity]] in the content they produce. Community media, drawing especially on volunteers, can be a unique source of local dialogue and [[information exchange]]. The lack of adaption and of efficient economic strategies from [[Old media|traditional media]] has led to proliferation of privately owned media. This involves a diversification of newspapers but may also affects quality journalism and [[media independence]], especially with the financial contributions from "backers".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pluralism in media ownership ===

==== State-owned media ====
In 2012, the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private.&lt;ref&gt;Arab States Broadcasting Union. 2015. Arab Satellite Broadcasting Annual Report 2015. Available at http://www.asbu.net/medias/NewMedia_2016/text/asbu_report_2015.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[government]] owned channels in the media sector is paralleled by a growth in outlets with a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] agenda. In some countries, private media outlets often maintain close ties to governments or individual politicians , while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), public service broadcasting tend to struggle with fundings and to decline since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2015. Funding of Public Service Media 2015. Available at https://www.ebu.ch/publications/funding-of-public-service-med-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlled liberalization ====
Media [[privatization]] and the lessening of the State dominance over media content is a global trend, according to the [[World Trends Report]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Establishing profitable models of [[State ownership|state-owned]] but relatively independent papers is part of the controlled liberalization process and is a common practice in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] region.
* State owned papers are top selling in Africa and the Arab region but often lack in reflecting society's plurality.
* [[Vertical integration]] and concentration in [[Mature market|mature markets]] are found in Central and Eastern Europe, but they tend to lack [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] on ownership and of institutional safeguards with regard to pluralism (e.g. monitoring of concentration and regulatory intervention).
* Limits to [[Concentration of media ownership|concentration]] are clearly set out in Western Europe but they face [[Lobbying|lobbies]] from media actors who are able to loosen norms and the enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== New types of cross-ownership ====
{{See also|Cross ownership}}[[Cross ownership|Cross-ownership]] is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Drawing the line between the media and other industries is a challenge for new types of cross-ownership. The acquisition of the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] by the founder of online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] raised concerns about the newspaper independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the [[Digital media|online media]]—and print—and introduced significant innovations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Community-centered media ownership model ====
Most common in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas [[Community media|community-centered media]] ownership is also mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities. They are also characterized as "independent and governed by and in the service of the communities they serve"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series/defining|title=Community media sustainability|last=|first=|date=2017-04-07|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represent what UNESCO calls &lt;ref&gt;Steve Buckley, 2011, Community Media: A Good Practice Handbook.

=== Advertising, between old and new models ===
[[File:Internet_advertising_revenue_2012-2016.svg|thumb|286x286px|Internet advertising revenue 2012-2016]]
One of the challenges to [[Old media|traditional media]] is [[Advertising|advertisement]], which has evolved since 2010. According to the World Trends Report&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, between 2012 and 2016, revenues from advertisement in print have decreased by 27 percent In 2012, print advertising’s share of total news advertising revenue was 48 per cent, falling to 38 per cent by 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Circulation of [[Digital newspaper|digital versions of traditional newspapers]] and digital advertisements have grown significantly, but have not been sufficient to offset losses in print. Once the transitioning phase from old media to digital media is over, revenues from digital advertisement tend to increase.&lt;ref&gt;PwC. 2017. IAB internet advertising revenue report 2016 full year results. Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The trend captured by the study of the Internet Advertising Bureau is limited to the USA, where the largest multinational companies  that are responsible for transformations in digital advertisement are headquartered&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon pushed advertisers to pay premium prices to quality publications.

Tauel Harper considers that with the rise of [[big data]], media have been seen to lose the "advertising [[subsidy]]" for journalistic content, through which "private" advertising paid for "[[Civic journalism|public journalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Tauel. 2016.

=== New platforms and business models ===
The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in the [[United States]], or the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] in [[South Africa]] use extensions or variations of existing schemes such as pay-walls created by publications considered to be of particularly high quality or addressing a particular niche.

The [[The Guardian|Guardian]] uses [[Wikipedia]]'s borrowed strategy of frequently asking readers for [[Donation|donations]] in support to quality journalism or [[free content]].

In various sectors, the number of [[Crowdfunded Journalism|crowdfunded journalism]] projects has increased significantly. While in 2012, 88 projects received funding through the platform, in 2015, the number of projects rose to 173, scattered across 60 countries (even if North America continues to register the majority of funded projects). The funds collected grew from $1.1 million in 2012 to $1.9 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy, and Amy Mitchell. 2016.

Economic models also depend on larger structural reconfiguration of the market. While in 2012 advertising revenues from [[Mobile advertising|mobile]] represented a tiny portion of the market in the [[United States]], in 2016 they surpassed revenues from all other platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media actors have also started testing new formats and technologies of journalism, experimenting with how [[virtual reality]] or [[Video game journalism|gaming]] can facilitate immersive experiences of relatively distant events. In 2015 for example, the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] opened its Virtual Reality Lab, seeking to provide original perspectives on issues ranging from the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], to the [[South Sudanese Civil War|conflict in South Sudan]], to the thinning of the [[Antarctica|ice cap in Antarctica]]. The [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] app proved the most downloaded in the history of interactive applications launched by the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Madeline. 2015.

According to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[Petabyte|petabytes]] was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Systems. 201.

=== User-generated content ===
Reaching two billion daily active users in June 2017, [[Facebook]] has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. 2017. Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Now Has 2 Billion Users Worldwide. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-userbase/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as: [[Twitter]] in [[Japan]], [[Naver]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Instagram]] (owned by Facebook) and [[LinkedIn]] (owned by [[Microsoft]]) in [[Africa]], [[VKontakte]] (VK) and [[Odnoklassniki]] in [[Russia]] and other countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] in [[China]].

However, a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide, most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or [[end-to-end encryption]] (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Snapchat]], [[Signal (software)|Signal]], and [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]), but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since 2012. In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 per cent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.|last=Graham|first=Mark|last2=Staumann|first2=Ralph K.|last3=Hogan|first3=Bernie|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers 105 (6): 1158–1178.|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithms, echo chambers and polarization ===
The proliferation of online sources represents a vector leading to an increase in pluralism but [[Algorithm|algorithms]] used by [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and [[Web search engine|search engines]] to provide users with a personalized experience based on their individual preferences represent a challenge to pluralism, restricting exposure to differing viewpoints and news feed. This is commonly referred to as "eco-chambers" and "[[Filter bubble|filter-bubbles]]".

With the help of algorithms, filter bubbles influence users choices and perception of reality by giving the impression that a particular point of view or representation is widely shared. Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum of membership of the European Union in the United Kingdom]] and the [[United States presidential election|United States presidential elections]], this gained attention as many individuals confessed their surprise at results that seemed very distant from their expectations. The range of pluralism is influenced by the personalized individualization of the services and the way it diminishes choice.

=== Fake news ===
[[File:The_roots_of_'fake_news'.png|thumb|314x314px|The roots of "fake news", UNESCO's [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf World Trends Report]]]
The term "[[fake news]]" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America. It is determined by [[Fraud|fraudulent]] content in news format and its velocity. According to Bounegru, Gray, Venturini and Mauri, fake news is when a deliberate lie "is picked up by dozens of other [[Blog|blogs]], retransmitted by hundreds of websites, cross-posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands" that it then effectively becomes "fake news".&lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana, Jonathan Gray, Tommaso Venturini, and Michele Mauri. 2017.

=== Marginalized groups ===
The media covering of [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]] such as refugees tend to be influenced by and influence the political and social perceptions. While a large proportion of the European press initially articulated a sympathetic and empathetic response towards the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in [[Syria]], according to Georgiou and Zaborowski, this sentiment was gradually replaced by suspicion and, in some cases, hostility towards [[Refugee|refugees]] and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, Myria, and Rafal Zaborowski. 2016.

=== News players ===
[[Gatekeeping (communication)|Gate-keeping]] mechanisms continue to influence not only what is being communicated, but also who is given the opportunity to frame events. Citizens’ voices have indeed increased in new stories, individuals included in these stories tend to be treated, not as agents capable of asserting their world views and their interpretation of events, but rather as [[Vox populi|vox-pol]], employed to add color to a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Toni G.L.A., Piet Verhoeven, Johannes W.J. Beentjes, and Rens Vliegenthart. 2016. Disrupting gatekeeping practices: Journalists’ source selection in times of crisis.

Johnson. 2011. The Arab Spring| Overthrowing the Protest Paradigm? How The New York Times, Global Voices and Twitter Covered the Egyptian Revolution. International journal of Communication 5: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although novel media operations and actors have had a smaller impact on mainstream reporting, they have been instrumental in animating intermediate spaces, which aggregate content in ways that can reach broader audiences.

As users increasingly move from broadcast to online media to access information, the same large media institutions tend to predominate online spaces, even if filtered and mediated in much of their social media presence. A decade later, the majority of the most visited and viewed news websites remain traditional media outlets ([[CNN]], New York Times, the Guardian, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], [[BBC News|BBC]]), although news aggregation websites such as [[Reddit]] and [[Google News]] have emerged among the top five sites with the highest [[web traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexa. 2017.

=== Media and information literacy ===
Authors Frau-Meigs, Velez, and Michel (2017) and Frau-Meigs and Torrent (2009) consider diversity in media can also be enhanced by [[Information and media literacy|media and information literacy]] (MIL).&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, and Jordi Torrent. 2009.

Many types of MIL exist from [[information literacy]], [[media literacy]], news literacy, advertising literacy, [[digital literacy]], media education, to digital and media literacy. A few initiatives already exist in the field:

Available on platforms such as [[Coursera]] and [[edX]], as well as by [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], these courses target both students and consumers of media, as well as teachers.
* There have also been a growing number of initiatives launched by internet companies to combat [[online hate speech]] or the proliferation of ‘fake news’, largely built on users’ inputs and support in flagging content that appears to not comply with a platform’s [[terms of service]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford History Education Group. 2016.

== Gender equality ==

Tuchman, Daniels, and Benoit (1978) use the term "[[symbolic annihilation]]" (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe women's relationship to and visibility in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media.

[[Regional organization|Regional]] and [[International organization|international organizations]] also recognize gender and media pluralism as often being problematic:

* In 2010, [[UNESCO]] developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2013, the Council of the [[European Parliament]] adopted the recommendation made by the European Institute for Gender Equality, that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2016, [[UN Women]] launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on eradicating all forms of inequalities. The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The media workforce ===
According to Byerly, in many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: intercultural dialogue. Nordicom. Available at http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A769151&amp;dswid=-8862. Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of [[Women in media|women media]] professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media workforce.&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the US, Harp, Bachmann, and Loke, show that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of columnist at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 GMMP found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Closer analysis shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent), for example, and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65. Part of this is likely due to recent improvements that have allowed more young women to enter the field, but it could also relate to the differences in how aging is perceived between men and women, as well as limitations in career advancement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center|Women’s Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the USA shows that at 20 of the nation’s top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Women’s Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at https://www.womensmediacenter.com/reports/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.-media-2017. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016.

=== Women and decision-making ===
[[File:Gender_equality_in_decision-making_positions_and_on_boards_in_media_organizations_in_Europe.svg|thumb|439x439px|Gender equality in decision-making positions and on boards in media organizations in Europe]]
The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top [[management]] (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and [[Eastern Europe]] (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]] region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings: men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017. Gender Statistics Database. Available at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/dgs. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In [[Southern Africa]], a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whose-news-whose-views/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that [[sexual harassment]] remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

=== Representation ===
The 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]] made a comparison across 20 years of women's representation in the media and assessed that between 1995 (17 percent) and 2015 (24 percent), female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sarah Macharia highlights the fact that where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[Spokesperson|spokespersons]] and 19 per cent of [[Expert|experts]] featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in [[North America]], followed by the [[Caribbean]] (29 per cent) and [[Latin America]] (27 per cent). In the [[Southern Africa|southern African]] region, Gender Links’ 2016 Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women’s views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The '''multi-step flow theory''' assumes ideas flow from mass media to [[opinion leader]]s before being disseminated to a wider [[population]]. This theory was first introduced by [[sociologist]] [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] et al. in 1944 and elaborated by [[Elihu Katz]] and Lazarsfeld in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"Media Now: understanding media, culture and technology", Straubhaar, LaRose, Davenport; page 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-step flow theory also states opinion leaders are affected more by “[[elite media]]” than run-of-the-mill, mass media.  This is evident by political opinion leaders receiving their information from unconventional sources such as [[The Huffington Post]], instead of [[Fox news|Fox News]] or [[MSNBC]].

According to the multi-step flow theory, opinion leaders intervene between the “media’s direct message and the audience’s reaction to that message.” Opinion leaders tend to have the great effect on those they are most similar to—based on personality, interests, [[demographics]], or [[Socio-economic|socio-economic factors]]. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors more quickly than conventional media because the [[audience]] is able to better identify or relate to an opinion leader than an article in a [[newspaper]] or a [[news program]].

This [[Media influence theory|media influence]] theory shows that information [[dissemination]] is a social occurrence, which may explain why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences’ attitudes.

An important factor of the multi-step flow theory is how the social influence is modified.  Information is affected by the [[social norms]] of each new [[community group]] that it enters.  It is also shaped by conflicting views surrounding it.

== Examples in Society ==

Businesses and politicians have harnessed the power of opinion leaders.  An example of this [[phenomenon]] is how individuals and companies have turned to [[Twitter]] influencers and [[bloggers]] to increase [[Media circus|hype]] around specific topics.

During the [[2008 Presidential Elections]], [[Sean Combs]] became an opinion leader for voting with his "[[Vote or Die]]" campaign.

Former Vice President, [[Al Gore]] also utilized the multi-step flow theory to gain support for his nonprofit, [[The Climate Project]].  Gore recruited individuals who were educated on environmental issues and had the ability to be influential in their community and amongst their friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;http://stonehousesummit.com/two-step-flow-influence-opinion-leader-campaigns-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt;  He then trained his opinion leaders on the information he wanted them to disseminate.   This ultimately enabled them to educate many Americans about The Climate Project and Gore’s overall ideas about climate change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">[[File:nordlandboat.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Two Nordland Boats, the larger one is low in the water, loaded with a hold of fish or wooden logs. Photo from between 1890-1900.]]
The '''Nordland boat''' (or {{lang-no|Nordlandsbåt}}), is a type of [[fishing boat]] that has been used for centuries in northern counties of [[Nordland]], [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]] of [[Norway]] and derives its name from Nordland county where it has a long history.  It has dominated the [[Lofoten]] and [[Vesterålen]] islands fishing industry for centuries and is closely related to the old [[Viking]] [[longship]]s.

==Construction==
The Nordland boat has a clinker, or [[lapstrake]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] design and has its rudder on the [[sternpost]]. Its length varies from 14 to well over 40 feet and usually has a length to [[beam (nautical)|beam]] ratio of 3-1 to 4-1. It has a high [[prow]] and [[stern]], shallow [[keel]], [[v-hull (boat)|v-hull]] and has an inboard [[gunwale]], which can be used to drain off the fishing nets when they are drawn on board. Some of the larger Nordlanders have a detachable cabin that is used for shelter, often having a wood burning stove inside.&lt;ref name="Christiansen 1968 p.85"&gt;Christiansen (1968) p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordlander normally carries a large single [[square sail]] with the largest boats carrying a [[topsail]]. It's one of the few types of boats that still carries such a sail to the present day.

[[Oak]] had been a favorite wood for ship builders for centuries for its resistance to rot, strength, and durability. However, oak is not native to Norway north of the county of [[Trøndelag]] and is also a heavy wood which would make such boats difficult to pull up on shore, which was done on a daily basis. For these reasons, the materials used for the Nordland is almost exclusively [[pine]], and in the northern regions, [[fir]].&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1968), p.82-3&lt;/ref&gt; Pine and fir are lighter woods which would make it easier to be drawn up on shore, but at the expense of durability.

==Sami versions==
The Nordland boat has a very long history in the north Norwegian coastline, with both Norwegians and [[Sami people|Sami]], who are first recorded as sailing such boats from about 950 onwards.  Around 1000 AD the Sami were described as producing Nordlandbots for their Norwegian customers along the northern coastal farming communities, which the Norwegians soon started to build for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest differences between the Norwegian and Sami built Nordlands is that the Sami 'sewed' the lapstrakes together using reindeer intestines, while the Norwegians used iron rivets.&lt;ref name="Christiansen 1968 p.85"/&gt;  Nordland boats continued to be built for over 1,000 years, and in the early 20th century it was still used for fishing and coastal transport.
[[File:Nordland våpen.svg|thumb|175px| The coat-of-arms of [[Nordland]] County, Norway is from modern times (1965).]]

==Unique feature==
One of the unique features of the Nordland is its [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] system.  Dozens of fist size round rocks are placed at the bottom of the boat to keep the boat weighted down.  In the event that the boat is either swamped or capsizes, the rocks are designed to roll out of the boat which would lighten the boat and thus keep it afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Wooden Boat Magazine, ''A Nordlandsbat for Maine: An American Sailor Orders a Norwegian Icon'', March/April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Nordland Boat today==
Nordland boats today are no longer used as primarily fishing boats but as pleasure craft and have annual races.&lt;ref&gt;"Trebåtdagan på Rognan" (''Boat Regalia at Rognan'') http://www.hildringstimen.no Retrieved December 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The coat-of-arms of Nordland County shows the traditional boat - ''the Nordlandsbåt''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12760">'''RosUkrEnergo''' is a [[Swiss]]-registered venture company that transports [[natural gas]] from [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Eastern Europe|East European countries]]. 50% of the company is owned by [[Gazprom]], through its daughter Swiss-registered Rosgas Holding A.G., and another 50% by Swiss-registered private company Centragas Holding A.G., acting on behalf of a consortium of GDF Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://groupdf.com/about.asp Official website of GDF group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracy.ru/article.php?id=1057 Сомнительный посредник - Демократия.Ру]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusenergy.com/newssystem/opened/37/20060426/436603.htm Стали известны хозяева РосУкрЭнерго]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/weekly01.asp?id=3638 Emerging Markets Economic Briefings]&lt;/ref&gt; owned by [[Dmytro Firtash]] and {{ill|Ivan Fursin|uk|Фурсін Іван Геннадійович}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-241453.html UNIAN - Nemtsov: Russian part in RosUkrEnergo looks as improper as Ukrainian one]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute]], it was the sole importer of natural gas from [[Gazprom]] reselling it to [[Naftogaz Ukrainy]].

==History==
The company was created in July 2004 in a deal by former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and his [[Russian President|Russian counterpart]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to replace [[Eural Trans Gas]].&lt;ref name="timelineRosUkrEnergo"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96310/ Nation’s gas trade has volatile history rife with murky dealings], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2006 the company acted as a middleman between Turkmenistan and Ukraine. The company also sells Turkmenistan gas to [[Poland]]. Due to an agreement between Gazprom and Naftogaz, from 2006 till January 2009 the company supplied all of Ukraine's natural gas imports from [[Russia]] and other Central Asian countries, in addition to Turkmenistan. On October 24, 2008 [[Gazprom]] and Ukraine's national energy company [[Naftogaz]] signed a long-term cooperation deal in which was stated that Ukraine will receive Russian natural gas directly from Gazprom and Naftogaz will be the sole importer of Russian natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-280400.html Gazprom, Naftogaz sign long-term cooperation deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

After weeks of disputes the head of Gazprom Alexei Miller and the head of [[Naftohaz Ukrainy]] Oleh Dubyna signed the 10-year agreement on natural gas supplies to Ukraine for the period of 2009-2019 on 19 January 2009.&lt;ref name=UNA190109&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It was agreed that RosUkrEnergo will no longer supply all of Ukraine's natural gas imports from Russia and other Central Asian countries. A claim of a $600&amp;nbsp;million debt of Naftohaz to RosUkrEnergo was also dropped.&lt;ref name=UNA190109/&gt;

On March 4, 2009 Officers of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) and the Alfa special police unit  searched the headquarters of Naftohaz Ukrainy in a case against officials of Naftohaz Ukrainy on embezzlement of 6.3 billion cubic meters of transit [[natural gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/184429.html SBU Officers Leave Building Of Naftohaz On Completing Investigating Actions], [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (March 4, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Valerii Khoroshkovskyi]], first deputy chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine, the RosUkrEnergo Company and a number of Verkhovna Rada’s deputies had filed in a claim against Naftohaz Ukrainy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/184592.html Khoroshkovskyi Unveils Reasons Behind RosUkrEnergo’s And Verkhovna Rada Deputies’ Claims Against Misappropriating 6.3 Billion Cubic Meters Of Gas], [[Ukrainian News Agency]], (March 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2009 a criminal case was filed against officials of the Naftohaz Ukrainy national joint-stock company on suspicion of stealing 6.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas intended for transit through Ukraine by the SBU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/186573.html SBU Sends Criminal Case Against Naftohaz Ukrainy Officials Accused Of Stealing 6.3 Billion Cubic Meters Of Gas To Prosecutors], [[Ukrainian News Agency]], (March 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010 an [[international arbitration]] court in [[Stockholm]] ordered Naftohas Ukrainy to pay RosUkrEnergo around $200 million as a penalty for various breaches of supply, transit and storage contracts.&lt;ref name=Stockholm/&gt; On June 8, 2010 the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal ordered Naftohaz to return 11 bcm of natural gas to RosUkrEnergo and that RosUkrEnergo would receive from Naftohaz a further 1.1 bcm of natural gas in lieu of RosUkrEnergo's entitlement to penalties for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=Stockholm&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/69022/ Stockholm court obliges Naftogaz to return 12.1 billion cubic meters of gas to RosUkrEnergo], [[Kyiv Post]] (June 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/70879/ BYuT publishes documents on sales of disputed 11 billion cubic meters of gas by Gazprom to Naftogaz], [[Kyiv Post]] (June 25, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2011 former [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] sued [[Dmytro Firtash]] and RosUkrEnergo in a [[U.S. District Court]] in [[Manhattan]] accusing them of "defrauding Ukraine's citizenry" by manipulating an arbitration court ruling, "undermining the rule of law in Ukraine" in connection with the 2010 international arbitration court ruling in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/ukraine-naftogaz-lawsuit-idUSN276396520110427 Ukrainian ex-PM sues gas company, businessman in US court], [[Reuters]] (April 27, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eural Trans Gas==
'''Eural Trans Gas''' (ETG) was an energy company registered in [[Budapest]], Hungary, on December 6, 2002. It was suspected of acting as a [[Gazprom]] front. Andras Knopp, a former Hungarian communist cultural functionary with no knowledge of the gas business, became director of the company. The registered owner was Dmytro Firtash, an obscure Ukrainian national who reportedly had little if any known assets. Yet the person received almost $300 million in credits from Russian banks.&lt;ref name="gazpromeuropeanweb"&gt;[http://ua-energy.org/uploads/library/analitics/FULL_GazpromsWeb.pdf Gazprom’s European Web]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Jamestown Foundation. February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

ETG maintained an account at a Budapest branch of Vienna's [[Raiffeisen Bank]] and had a number of accounts in Vienna's [[Meinl Bank]].&lt;ref name="gazpromeuropeanweb"/&gt;

==Owners and allegations of criminal connections==
Former Ukrainian Prime-Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated in November 2006, the company is controlled by notorious Ukrainian-born Jewish [[Russian mafia]] boss [[Semion Mogilevich]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Tymoshenko ''"we have no doubts whatsoever that the man named [[Semyon Mogilevich|Mogilevich]] is behind the whole operation called RosUkrEnergo"'', see  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6121508.stm The High Price of Gas] by [[BBC News]] (aired November 5, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2009 Vladimir Putin was quoted as claiming that RosUkrEnergo is owned by a business ally of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/09/news/gazprom.php Russia and Ukraine reach pact on gas deliveries], International Herald Tribune, January 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian investigation into RosUkrEnergo begun during Tymoshenko's previous term as Prime Minister was closed after she lost her position as Prime Minister in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/303006.htm Mogilevich Arrested With Arbat Boss], The Moscow Times, January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to a document uncovered during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] US-diplomats shared Tymoshenko's suspicions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/91986/ U.S. official: Austrian bank’s ties to RosUkrEnergo suspicious], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 3, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, London-based corruption watchdog [[Global Witness]] published a report focusing on RosUkrEnergo and other transit companies that have acted as intermediaries between Turkmenistan, Russia and Ukraine. The report highlighted the many links in personnel between RosUkrEnergo and the previous intermediary Eural Trans Gas. According to the report, Israeli lawyer Zeev Gordon had registered Eural Trans Gas on behalf of Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/296/its_a_gas_april_2006_lowres.pdf It’s a Gas—Funny Business in the Turkmen-Ukraine Gas Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in late April 2006, ''[[Izvestia]]'' reported that the primary shareholder of RosUkrEnergo is Dmytro Firtash. The report stated that he owned 90% of CentraGas Holding, equaling 45% of RosUkrEnergo. The report stated that a further owner is another Ukrainian businessman Ivan Fursin, the primary shareholder of the [[Odessa Film Studio]] and an owner of Misto-bank. His stake was revealed to be 10% of CentraGas and therefore a 5% owner of RosUkrEnergo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://izvestia.ru/economic/article3092391/ Известия.Ру: Кто владеет украинским газом]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profits==
RosUkrEnergo reported a 2005 profit of $755 million and paid $735 million in dividends.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business.html ROSUKRENERGO - Business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's 2006 profit is listed at over $785 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

RosUkrEnergo profit for January–September 2007 is reported at $213 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazprom.ru/articles/article26995.shtml ОАО «Газпром» | Акционерам и инвесторам / Отчеты / Промежуточная финансовая отчетность 30.09.2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company makes its profit on re-exporting gas to Europe. The size of the profit is defined by Gazprom through the export allowances of about 9 billion cubic meters a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosukrenergo.ch/eng/pub/business/financial_data.html ROSUKRENERGO - Business - Financial data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; RosUkrEnergo supplies gas to the Hungarian gas distributor [[Emfesz]], for example, which is also controlled by Firtash via his holding company [[Group DF]].

Effectively, by engaging in this supply scheme Gazprom transfers profits from its shareholders to the shareholders of RosUkrEnergo.

'''Sokwanele''' is a popular protest [[resistance movement|underground movement]] based in [[Zimbabwe]]. They are pro-democracy, and they embrace supporters of all pro-democratic political parties, [[civic engagement|civic]] organisations and institutions. Sokwanele is committed to challenging and confronting – through [[non-violent]] activism – the way in which the ruling party, [[Zanu-PF]], governs Zimbabwe. Sokwanele is not affiliated to the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) at all; in fact, the group's website very clearly states that they do not aspire to political office. 

Sokwanele means 'enough is enough' in [[Sindebele language|Ndebele]]; the [[Shona language|Shona]] equivalent of the name is '[[Zvakwana]]'.

Sokwanele communicates with its supporters primarily via a [[newsletter]] that people can subscribe to online. They also have a website, and they run a regularly updated blog entitled ''This is Zimbabwe''. The government has imposed very tight restrictions on the media in Zimbabwe, and very few newspapers or radio stations that are critical of the government are permitted to operate. Sokwanele's communications provide a critical and impartial assessment of the government's actions, regularly reporting on corruption, human rights violations and bad [[governance]].

Sokwanele closely monitored, in the 22 weeks leading up to the [[parliamentary]] elections on 31 March 2005, the government's compliance with the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] 'Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections'. The protocol was agreed by SADC leaders in [[Mauritius]] on 17 August 2004 and Zimbabwe was one of the signatories. Sokwanele circulated their weekly assessments through a special newsletter entitled 'Mauritius Watch'. Their final report based on the mounting evidence of non-compliance concluded that the elections were deeply flawed and did not satisfy the SADC principles and guidelines, and therefore could not possibly be considered 'free and fair'. They reached this conclusion before the elections took place.

On [[election|polling]] day itself, Sokwanele blogged regular updates from [[activists]] on the ground who alerted them to unscrupulous government activities which included refusing access to polling agents from the main opposition party, imprisoning MDC agents, incommunicado, after the vote; and controlling all forms of communication to and from the polling stations. They also reported on the difficulty that some [[voters]] had in trying to vote, and reports from voters of the presence of dead relatives on the [[voter's roll]]. On the basis of this evidence, after the voting was over, Sokwanele went on to produce a report that detailed the hour by hour events on polling day into how they allege the government comprehensively [[Vote rigging|rigged]] the elections.

More recently, Sokwanele has written several [[essay|articles]] critical of the government's '[[Operation Murambatsvina]] (Operation Drive Out Trash).' Using [[Flickr]], Sokwanele has also compiled a set of photographs depicting the impact of Operation Murambatsvina on ordinary Zimbabwean civilians.

'''The Milky Way Project''' is a [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] project whose main goal is to identify [[stellar-wind bubble]]s in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Users classify sets of [[infrared]] images from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ([[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/about/research|title=Zooniverse|website=www.zooniverse.org|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe bubbles in these images are the result of young, massive stars whose light causes shocks in interstellar gas.

[[File:Bubbles Within Bubbles.jpg|thumb|An example of what is called a hierarchical bubble structure, in which one giant bubble, carved into the dust of space by massive stars, has triggered the formation of smaller bubbles]]

==Details==

The Milky Way Project works with data taken from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer Galactic Plane Survey (MIPSGAL) and Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE). Only a small part uses WISE data. The project looks for bubbles, which can mean the formation of stars. The project also looks for knots, star clusters, and other objects such as young stars, [[supernova]] remnants, and newly discovered galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milky Way Project|url=http://spacehack.org/project/milky-way-project|website=Spacehack|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Milky Way Project: Can you help?|url=http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=574|website=Night Sky Network|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory - California Institute of Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Milky Way Project started as the ninth Zooniverse project in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/06/26/coming-soon/|title=Coming Soon…|last=Zooniverse|first=The|date=2010-06-26|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.milkywayproject.org/2010/12/07/site-goes-live/|title=Site Goes Live|last=ttfnrob|date=2010-12-07|website=The Milky Way Project Blog|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''phase 1'' worked with the colors: 4.5 μm for blue, 8.0 μm for green and 24 μm for red. This resulted in the Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Milky Way Project in 2012 with 5,106 bubbles, which can also be found in [[SIMBAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=R. J.|last2=Povich|first2=M. S.|last3=Kendrew|first3=S.|last4=Lintott|first4=C.

The ''annulus tool'' that was used to mark the bubbles in the Milky Way Project ''phase 1'' was at random round and needed improvement. This problem was solved after the introduction of the ''ellipse tool''. This new tool was used in the ''phase 2'' of the project, short after DR1. This changed the classification and the tool does fit the actual shape of the bubbles. The phase 2 also used different colors: 3.6 μm for blue, 4.5 μm for green and 8.0 μm for red. The same three colors as [http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/?target=&amp;fov=3.00&amp;survey=P%2FGLIMPSE360 GLIMPSE 360 in Aladin Lite].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/a-brief-history-of-the-milky-way-project-why-we-still-need-your-help/ |title=A Brief History of the Milky Way Project: Why We (Still) Need Your Help |author=tharinduj96 |date=2016-10-12 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phase 3'' is also called Phoenix since it started after a year offline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://polyastron.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/the-milky-way-project-phoenix/ |title=The Milky Way Project: Phoenix |last=Povich |first=Matthew S. |date=2016-09-15 |website=The Milky Way Project Blog |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now active. Phase 3 uses the same colors as phase 1 and the same ellipse tool as phase 2, combining the strength of phase 1+2.

The Milky Way Project did also search for star clusters and galaxies. Phase 2 additionally did search for Extended Green Objects (EGO), 4.5 μm emissions that seem to be connected to [[Astrophysical maser|outflow from massive young stellar objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cyganowski|first=C.

Phase 3 aims to create a reliable bubble catalog (DR2) with the data from phase 2+3 (4.4 million classifications), an improved yellowball catalog and the largest bowshock catalog to date. For this goal the 24 μm part of the image is important: Bubbles are more easy to spot and bowshocks are most of the time visible at this wavelength.

The ''MWP classification aggregation pipeline'' is continuously tested and modified to avoid issues that were encountered in DR1.

[[File:BaliHaiNOLA59Postcard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|"The Bali Ha'i", a tiki themed restaurant in [[New Orleans]], 1950s [[A-Frame house|A-Frame style]]]]
'''Tiki culture''' is a 20th-century theme used in [[Polynesia]]n-style restaurants and clubs originally in the United States and then, to a lesser degree, around the world. Although inspired in part by [[tiki]] carvings and mythology, the connection is loose and stylized, being an American form and not a [[Polynesian art|Polynesian fine art]] form. 
==In the United States==
[[File:Suffering Bastard Cocktail.jpg|thumb|The Suffering Bastard cocktail, a WWII-era tiki drink, at Latitude 29 in New Orleans]]
Tiki culture in the United States began in 1933 with the opening of Don's Beachcomber, later changed to [[Don the Beachcomber]], a Polynesian-themed bar and restaurant in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/tiki|author=Wayne Curtis|title=Tiki|work=American Heritage|date=August–September 2006|volume=57|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proprietor was Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt, a young man from [[Texas]] who had sailed throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]; later he legally changed his name to Donn Beach.  His restaurant featured [[Cantonese cuisine]] and exotic rum [[Punch (drink)|punches]], with a decor of flaming [[torch]]es, [[rattan]] furniture, flower [[Lei (Hawaii)|lei]]s, and brightly colored fabrics. Three years later, Victor Bergeron, better known as [[Trader Vic]], adopted a tiki theme for his restaurant in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], which eventually grew to become a worldwide chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradervicspaloalto.com/restaurant/history.html|title=Trader Vics History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228110534/http://www.tradervicspaloalto.com/restaurant/history.html|archivedate=2005-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme took on a life of its own during the restaurant's growth in the Bay Area.  The Trader Vic's in [[Palo Alto]] even spawned architectural choices, such as the concept behind the odd-looking Tiki Inn Motel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critiki.com/cgi-bin/location.cgi?loc_id=136|title=Tiki Inn Motel in Palo Alto, CA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still exists as the Stanford Terrace Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordterraceinn.com|title=Stanford Terrace Inn|website=www.stanfordterraceinn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's [[World's Fair]] in 1939 – the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] – celebrated for the first time [[Polynesian culture]] in the United States. The theme of this fair was "Pageant of the Pacific" primarily showcasing the goods of nations bordering the Pacific Ocean. The theme was physically symbolized by "The Tower of the Sun" and a giant, 80-foot statue of [[Pacifica (statue)|Pacifica]], goddess of the Pacific Ocean.

==Cuisine and cocktails==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Mai Tai.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Mai Tai]] is a quintessential tiki cocktail.]]
Tiki culture of mid-century America was primarily born in the restaurant industry. Don the Beachcomber's in Hollywood, California, is largely credited as being the first tiki restaurant from which all other eateries and bars "borrowed." Donn Beach, the founder of Don The Beachcomber, is also credited as having created the tropical drink genre singlehandedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.donthebeachcomber.com/pages/about-us|title = Our History|date = |accessdate = 21 June 2016|website = Don the Beachcomber|publisher = |last = |first = |location = Huntington Beach, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach was the first restaurateur to mix flavored syrups and fresh fruit juices with [[rum]]. These drinks were called Rhum Rhapsodies and made Don the Beachcomber's restaurant the hot spot for Hollywood elite and stars from the 1940s well into the 1960s. By the mid to late 1950s, many restaurateurs had begun to copy, and in some cases, steal Beach's theme, food and cocktails. Many eventually created their own cocktails and signature food dishes based on Asian themes. Beach is credited for having created some of the most memorable exotic cocktails such as the Scorpion and the [[Zombie (cocktail)|Zombie]]. [[Howard Hughes]] was a regular at the Hollywood Don the Beachcomber, as were [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/restaurants/don-the-beachcomber|title=Don the Beachcomber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron was a Beach contemporary and the founder of [[Trader Vic's]] restaurant chain. Both created a variety of "Polynesian" dishes, including [[crab Rangoon]] and [[rumaki]].

The [[Mai Tai]] is considered to be the quintessential tiki cocktail. A protracted feud between Beach and Bergeron erupted when both claimed to have invented the Mai Tai.

Most tiki-themed establishments served at least some of their cocktails in ceramic mugs depicting tikis, also known as [[tiki mugs]]. The styles and sizes varied widely. Most restaurants offered their signature drink in a tiki mug that the patron was able to take home.  This led to a large number of tiki mugs surviving as souvenirs. Today, the tiki mug is a highly prized find and is considered to be as much a symbol of the tiki culture as a tiki itself.

With the resurgence of tiki culture in the later part of the 1990s, a resurgence in the interest of the original exotic cocktails has grown as well. Jeff "Beachbum" Berry released several drink books containing the recipes for many of the signature drinks from long lost tiki restaurants and bars, as well as classic tiki cocktails from Trader Vic's and Don the Beachcombers.

Today, Trader Vic's is the only major restaurant chain still in operation. However, a new Don The Beachcomber was opened in [[Huntington Beach, California]] in 2009—having taken over Sam's Seafood Restaurant/Kona. Sam's was also a long lived tiki-themed restaurant that dated back to the 1940s. It was sold in 2007 and the name was changed to Kona for a short period before the current owner of the Don The Beachcomber corporate name took it over.

==After World War II==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
When American servicemen returned home from [[World War II]], they brought with them stories and souvenirs from the South Pacific. [[James Michener]] won the 1948 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his collection of short stories, ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'', which in turn was the basis for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', the 1949 musical by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], also a Pulitzer Prize winner.

In addition to the returning WWII veterans, several other factors contributed to the mid-century American explosion in Polynesian pop culture or tiki culture. Post-war America saw the rise of the middle class as an economic force. This coupled with ever-increasing affordability of travel, particularly newly established air travel to Hawaii, helped to propel the nation's interest in all things tropical. The excitement surrounding the 1947 [[Kon-Tiki]] expedition helped to promote tiki culture. [[State of Hawaii#U.S. statehood|Hawaiian statehood]] in 1959 was a major factor which further drove the tropical lifestyle popularity, and Americans fell in love with their romanticized version of an exotic culture.

Polynesian design began to infuse every aspect of the country's visual aesthetic, from home accessories to architecture. Single family homes, apartment complexes, business and even large shopping and living districts of some cities were heavily influenced by Polynesian aesthetics.  However, by the 1980s, most of the Polynesian aesthetic had been completely wiped away in the name of progress.  Nevertheless, some architectural examples of homes, apartments and restaurant buildings remain. A small handful of locations still contain carved tikis.

==Music==
Soon came integration of the idea into music by artists like [[Les Baxter]], [[Arthur Lyman]], and [[Martin Denny]], who blended the tiki idea through [[jazz]] augmented with Polynesian, Asian, and Latin instruments and "tropical" themes creating the [[Exotica]] genre. This music blended the elements of [[Afro-Cuban jazz|Afro-Cuban rhythm]]s, unusual instrumentations, environmental sounds, and lush romantic themes from [[Hollywood]] movies, topped off with evocative titles like "Jaguar God", into a cultural hybrid native to nowhere.

There were two primary strains of this kind of [[exotica]]: jungle and tiki. Jungle exotica was a Hollywood creation, with its roots in [[Tarzan]] movies and further back, to [[William Henry Hudson]]'s novel ''[[Green Mansions]]''. Les Baxter was the king of jungle exotica, and spawned a host of imitators.

Tiki exotica was introduced with Martin Denny's Waikiki nightclub jungle noises arrangement of Baxter's ''[[Quiet Village]]''. Tiki rode a wave of popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s marked by the entrance of [[Hawaii]] as the 50th state in 1959 and the introduction of [[tiki bar]]s and restaurants around the continental United States.

==Television==
The visual iconography of the CBS-TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', which was originally broadcast in 1964-1967, borrowed significantly from tiki culture, with the "castaways" depicted as building huts, furniture, and housewares that resembled elements of fantasy-Polynesian culture presented to Americans by period bars and restaurants.

A 1972 episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' took place in Hawaii and involved a magical, taboo tiki idol that becomes the center of the plot.

==Revival==
The mid-1990s saw the beginning of a revival of the tiki culture and a rise in popularity for traditional tiki cocktails in craft cocktail bars.

Contemporary "[[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]]" artists such as [[Shag (artist)|Shag]], [[Mark Ryden]], and Derek Yaniger use tiki imagery in their paintings.

Several books on the subject of tiki have been published, including ''The Book of Tiki'' by Sven Kirsten, published by Taschen.

The revival also spawned ''Tiki Noir'', a literary subgenre of hard-boiled crime fiction in a tiki setting, in which the main character, often a detective, but not always, is world-weary and deeply flawed; ''Ritual of the Savage'' by Jay Strongman being the prime example.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Tiki-themed events and conventions have begun to spring up across America—with the majority happening in Southern California. Large annual events include Tiki Oasis in San Diego;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tikioasis.com/2015/|title=Tiki Oasis in San Diego|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405060605/http://tikioasis.com/2015/|archivedate=2016-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hukilau in Fort Lauderdale, Tiki Caliente in Palm Springs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiki-caliente.com/|title=Home|first=TIki|last=Caliente|website=TIki Caliente}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ohana: Luau at the Lake in Lake George, NY.

A variety of online communities have formed for tikiphiles. The [[Fraternal Order of Moai]] is also a tiki-themed social organization in the United States.

==Cultural appropriation==
The question of whether tiki bars should be considered a type of [[cultural appropriation]] has arisen in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/ezq7n7/tiki-drinking-culture-has-always-been-a-fantasy-but-not-an-easy-one|title=Tiki Drinking Culture Has Always Been a Fantasy, But Not an Easy One|website=Munchies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/abolish-the-tiki-bar/|title=Abolish the Tiki Bar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars at the [[University of Exeter]] and [[Claremont Graduate University]] argue that tiki culture's stylish and seemingly innocuous cultural imagery can obscure and subsume native traditions and divert attention from the history of violent [[colonialism]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/33395/manag0502.pdf|title=Packaging Paradise:Organizing Representations of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol2/iss1/21/|title=Tiki Kitsch, American Appropriation, and the Disappearance of the Pacific Islander Body}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ossetians in Trialeti''' ({{lang-os|Триалеты Ирыстон}}) are a group of ethnic [[Ossetians]], settling the central [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] districts of [[Khashuri district, Georgia|Khashuri]] and [[Borjomi]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hEAK9vLEcjYC&amp;hl=en The Forsaken People: Case Studies of the Internally Displaced] by Roberta Cohen, Francis Mading Deng.

Some Ossetians and even some Georgians have returned to South Ossetia, and some Ossetians have also returned to cities elsewhere in Georgia, such as Borjomi an Tbilisi.''&lt;/ref&gt; historically part of the [[Trialeti]] province. The Ossetians resettled there in the 19th century from the territory, which is now known as [[South Ossetia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sakartvelo.com/Files/Conflicts/minorities.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, after the [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict (1918–1920)|conflict]] between the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian]] government forces and [[Bolshevik]]-sympathizing Ossetian rebels, and the forcible [[Sovietization of Georgia]], the recently created [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] within the [[Georgian SSR]] claimed the villages, mainly settled by Ossetians in Trialeti as its [[exclave]] - to no avail, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}Tsutsiev, Artur (2007).

A '''tzompantli''' {{IPA-nah|t͡somˈpant͡ɬi|}} or '''skull rack''' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, which was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|war captives]] or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]]. It is a scaffold-like construction of poles on which heads and skulls were placed after holes had been made in them.&lt;ref&gt;Palka (2000) pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been documented throughout Mesoamerica, and range from the Epiclassic (ca. 600–900 CE) through early Post-Classic (ca. 900–1250 CE).&lt;ref name=Mendo397&gt;Mendoza (2007) pg 397&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 archeologists announced the discovery of the Huey Tzompantli, with more than 650 skulls, in the archeological zone of the Templo Mayor in Mexico city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6|title=Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs|date=2017-07-03|access-date=2017-07-05|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name comes from the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language of the [[Aztec]]s but is also commonly applied to similar structures depicted in other civilizations. Its precise [[etymology]] is uncertain although its general interpretation is "skull rack," "wall of skulls," or "skull banner."&lt;ref name=Mendo397 /&gt; It's most likely a compound of the Nahuatl words ''tzontecomatl'' ("skull"; from ''tzontli'' or ''tzom-'' "hair", "scalp" and ''tecomatl'' ("[[gourd]]" or "container"), and ''pamitl'' ("banner"). That derivation has been ascribed to explain the depictions in several codices that associate these with banners; however, Nahuatl linguist [[Frances Karttunen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Frances Karttunen | title=Linguist list server | work=etymology of Tzompantli | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | accessdate=September 25, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025200407/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | archivedate=October 25, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed that ''pantli'' means merely "row" or "wall."

==Historical distribution==

===General information===
It was most commonly erected as a linearly-arranged series of vertical posts connected by a series of horizontal crossbeams. The skulls were pierced or threaded laterally along these horizontal stakes. An alternate arrangement, more common in the Maya regions, was for the skulls to be impaled on top of one another along the vertical posts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson et al. (1992) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are known chiefly from their depiction in Late Postclassic (13th to 16th centuries) and post-Conquest (mid-16th to 17th centuries) [[Maya codices|codices]], contemporary accounts of the [[conquistador]]es, and several other inscriptions. However, a ''tzompantli''-like structure, thought to be the first instance of such structures, has been excavated from the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]] at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]] site, dated from c. 2nd century BCE to 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp.236-239&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapotecs called this structure a "''yàgabetoo''," and it displayed 61 skulls.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007) 396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toltec===
At the Toltec capital of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] exists the first indications in Central Mexico of a real fascination with skulls and skeletons. Tula flourished from the ninth until the thirteenth century. The site includes the decimated remains of a tzompantli. The tzompantli at Tula displayed multiple rows of stone carved skulls adorning the sides of a broad platform upon which the actual skulls of sacrificial victims were exhibited. The tzompantli appeared during the final phases of civilization at Tula, which was destroyed around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Brandes (2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya===
Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] and other [[Puuc]] region sites of the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], dating from around the late 9th-century decline of the [[Maya Classical Era]]. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Großes Bild|2014-01-03 Tzompantli in Chichén Itzá anagoria.jpg|1500px|[[Chichén Itzá]] Tzompantli}}

Human sacrifice on a large scale was introduced to the Maya by the Toltecs from the appearances of the tzompantli by the Chichen Itza ball courts. Six ball court reliefs at Chichen Itza depict the decapitation of a ball player; it seems that the losers would be beheaded and would have their skulls placed on the Tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956&gt;Coe (2011) pg. 195-196 (or 210 in the 2015 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A ''tzompantli'' is illustrated to the right of a depiction of an Aztec temple dedicated to the deity [[Huitzilopochtli]]; from Juan de Tovar's 1587 manuscript, also known as the [[Ramírez Codex]].]]

===Aztec era===
The word ''tzompantli'' is [[Nahuatl]] and was used by the [[Aztec|Aztecs]] to refer to the skull-racks found in many Aztec cities; The first and most prominent example is the Huey Tzompantli (Great Skull-rack) located the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] and described by the early conquistadors. There were at least five more skull racks in Tenochtitlan but by all accounts they were much smaller. 

According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s eye-witness account, the ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'', written several decades after the event, after Cortes' expedition was forced to make their initial retreat from Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs erected a makeshift tzompantli to display the severed heads of men and horses they had captured from the invaders. This ''tzompantli'' is depicted in the twelfth book of the Florentine Codex. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10096/view/1/1/|title=General History of the Things of New Spain by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún: The Florentine Codex — Viewer — World Digital Library|website=www.wdl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/pohl/pohl_meeting.html|title=FAMSI - John Pohl's Mesoamerica - Historical Records of the Conquest|last=famsi|first=|date=|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This taunting is also depicted in an Aztec codex which relates the story, and the subsequent battles which led to the eventual capture of the city by the Spanish forces and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz del Castillo (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the stay of Cortes' expedition in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (initially as guest-captives of the Emperor [[Moctezuma II]], before the battle which would lead to the conquest), they reported a wooden ''tzompantli'' altar adorned with the skulls from recent sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2009) pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; Within the complex of the [[Templo Mayor]] itself, a relief in [[stucco]] depicted these sacrifices; the remains of this relief have survived and may now be seen in the ruins in the [[Zócalo]] of present-day [[Mexico City]]. 

==== Preparation of ''tzompantli'' ====
Excavations at [[Templo Mayor]] in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] have revealed many skulls belonging to women and children, in addition to those of men, a demonstration of the diversity of the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices in Aztec culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40473547|title=Aztec tower of human skulls uncovered in Mexico City|last1=BBC Staff|date=2 July 2017|work=British Broadcasting Company|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After displaying severed heads, many scholars have determined that limbs of Aztec victims would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|cannibalized]] &lt;ref&gt;Michael Harner (1977) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  Fray Diego Durán confirms this, stating that skulls were delivered to temples after "the flesh had been eaten".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Durán, Diego. ''Book of the gods and rites and the ancient calendar''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1971. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Durán notes that the ''tzompantli'' were periodically renovated. Regarding this, Durán states&lt;blockquote&gt;"When [the skulls] become old and deteriorated, they fell in pieces. When the palisade become old, however, it was renovated, and on its removal many [skulls] broke. Others were removed to make room for more, so that there would be a place for those were to be killed later"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeologist Eduardo Contreras believes that the tissue attached to skulls was removed prior to a ''tzompantli'' pole being inserted through the side of the skulls. He bases these assumptions off of excavations of the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at Tlatelolco, Mexico City between 1960 and 1965. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Huey Tzompantli ====
The Huey Tzompantli was the central ''tzompantli'' found in Tenochtitlan. The skull rack here served as a reminder of the Aztec's ongoing [[Flower war|Flowery Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of [[Aztec warfare]] was the capture of enemy warriors to serve as sacrificial victims, which is evident from the number of warriors found sacrificed around Aztec structures.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) pg 110&lt;/ref&gt; One conquistador, [[Andrés de Tapia]], was given the task of counting the skulls on the "tzompantli" at Tenochtitlan and estimated that there were 136,000 skulls on it.&lt;ref&gt;Harner (1977) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, based on numbers given by Taipa and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''"Hueyi Tzompantli"'' (Great Skullrack) of Tenochtitlan. The "Hueyi Tzompantli" consisted of a massive masonry platform composed of “thirty long steps” measuring fully 60 meters in length by 30 meters wide at its summit. Atop of the aforementioned platform was erected an equally formidable wooden palisade and scaffolding consisting of between 60 and 70 massive uprights or timbers woven together with an impressive constellation of horizontal cross beams upon which were suspended the tens of thousands of decapitated human heads once impaled thereon.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Mendoza (2007) p. 407-408.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding, this Bernal Díaz de Castillo states &lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember that they had in a plaza, where there were some shrines, so many places of dead skulls, which could be counted, according to the concert as they were set, that when they appeared they would be more than one hundred thousand; and I say again about one hundred thousand. And in another part of the square were as many rowers of bones without meat, bones of dead, that could not be counted; and they had in many beams many heads hanging from one part to another. And  keeping those bones and skulls were three priests, who, as we understood, wherein charge of them.  Of which we had to look more after we entered the land well: in all the villages they were that way, and also in Tascala."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Aparato_de_variantes_Historia_verdadera_de_la_conquista_de_la_Nueva_Espana.pdf|title=Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva España|last=Díaz del Castillo|first=Bernal|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various scholarly interpretations of the cosmological importance of Huey Tzompantli's placement have emerged.  Matos Monteczum claims that a central ''tzompantli'' was placed north of the Templo Mayor. Monteczuma notes that no corresponding shrine was found south. Monteczuma also notes that Mexica views of the universe, which divide the universe into a horizontal and vertical plane, claim that the northern sector of the horizontal plane corresponds to Mictlampa, or the land of the dead.  &lt;ref&gt;Vol. 53, No. 4, 75th Anniversary Meeting of the American Academy of Religion (Dec., 1985), pp. 797-813&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Rubén G. Mendoza contends that the Huey Tzompantli was placed on an east-west axis between the Templo Mayor and a principal ball court.  The Huey Tzompantli would have been aligned with the  marker within the Templo Mayor dividing one half for Tlaloc and the other half for Huitzilopochtli. Mendoza argues that as the sun traveled through the sky, it would have ascended into the "vault of the heavens," represented by the Huey Tzompantli. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MENDOZA|first=RUBÉN G.|date=2007|title=The Divine Gourd Tree|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf|journal=SpringerLink|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Modern archeological evidence has found that this large palisade was flanked by two circular towers made out of skulls and mortar. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/feeding-gods-hundreds-skulls-reveal-massive-scale-human-sacrifice-aztec-capital|title=Feeding the gods: Hundreds of skulls reveal massive scale of human sacrifice in Aztec capital|date=2018-06-20|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Historical depictions ====
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza]]
There are numerous depictions of ''tzompantli'' in [[Aztec codices]], dating from around the time or shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], such as the [[Diego Durán#Literary works and influence|''Durán Codex'']], ''[[Ramírez Codex]]'', and ''[[Codex Borgia]]''. The [[Codex Mendoza]] contains multiple depictions of ''tzompantli.'' The Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza depicts a ''tzompantli'' holding single skull next to an eagle perched on a cactus. A similar depiction of a ''tzompantli is'' used to represent the town of Tzompanco in the Codex Mendoza. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/codex-mendoza-1542/|title=Codex Mendoza (1542) – The Public Domain Review|website=publicdomainreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folio 45v of the Codex Borgia depicts a platform adorned with skulls. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/loubat/Borgia/thumbs0.html|title=FAMSI - Universitätsbibliothek Rostock - Codex Borgia (Loubat 1898)|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recent excavations ====
Archaeologists affilitated with the National Institute of Anthropology and History have partaken in a series of excavations since 2015 that have resulted in the finding of ''tzompantli.'' These excavations took place near the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and resulted in the finding of one ''tzompantli'' tower. These excavations have revealed that women and children were sacrificed, despite men making up 75% of sacrificial victims. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Association and meaning==
Apart from their use to display the skulls of ritualistically-executed war captives, ''tzompantli'' often occur in the contexts of [[Mesoamerican ballgame|Mesoamerican ball courts]], which were widespread throughout the region's civilizations and sites. The game was 'played for keeps' ending with the losing team being sacrificed. The captain of the winning team was tasked with taking the head of the losing team's captain to be displayed on a tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956 /&gt; In these contexts it appears that the tzompantli was used to display the losers' heads of this often highly ritualised game. Not all games resulted in this outcome, however, and for those that did it is surmised that these participants were often notable captives. An alternative theory is that it was the captain of the winning team who lost his head, but there is little evidence that this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1988) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Still, it is acknowledged that in Mesoamerican culture to be sacrificed was to be honored with feeding the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) 204-205&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], the former [[Toltec]] capital, has a well-preserved ''tzompantli'' inscription on its ball court.

The association with ball courts is also reflected in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the famous religious, mythological and cultural account of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]]. When [[Hun Hunahpu]], father of the [[Maya Hero Twins]], was killed by the lords of the Underworld ([[Xibalba]]), his head was hung in a [[gourd]] tree next to a ball court.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The gourd tree is a clear representation of a "tzompantli", and the image of skulls in trees as if they were fruits is also a common indicator of a tzompantli and the associations with some of the game's metaphorical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007)pg 418&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University Club of San Francisco''' is a [[Gentlemen's club|private social club]] located atop [[Nob Hill]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Notable members have included [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and conservationist [[John Muir]].

==History==
The University Club of San Francisco was founded in 1890 by William Thomas, an alumnus of [[Harvard University]] (class of 1873) and the President of the Harvard Club of San Francisco.  Thomas wished to have a club that would accept alumni of more universities than just Harvard, including other [[Ivy League]] schools and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] schools like [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Its first clubhouse was located in a two-story Victorian manse at 722 Sutter Street near Taylor Street, in the [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] district and just around the corner from the [[Bohemian Club]] and the [[Olympic Club]]. Like most clubs of its time, membership was limited to men, and any proposed member had to have completed at least two years at university, which was somewhat uncommon at the time. The facility included a private dining room, a forum for [[public speaking|after-dinner speakers]], and guestrooms.

The Club quickly outgrew the Sutter Street building and, in 1903, Club President [[William Bowers Bourn II]] hired architect [[Willis Polk]] to design a new clubhouse at the corner of Sutter and Van Ness Streets. Before the plans could be developed or the site purchased, however, the Sutter Street clubhouse was destroyed by fire in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. For the next two years, the Club rented and occupied temporary locations.

In 1908, the Club purchased a lot atop [[Nob Hill]] at what is now 800 Powell Street, on the northeast corner of California Street, across from the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] at the intersection of the two lines of the [[San Francisco cable car system]]. It previously had been the location of the mansion of [[Leland Stanford]], which also had been destroyed in the earthquake. There, the Club built a new four-story brick Italianate-style clubhouse, designed by the local firm of Bliss &amp; Faville, who also designed the [[Westin St. Francis]] Hotel, the [[Southern Pacific Building]], and portions of the 1915 [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]]. The new clubhouse devoted the second floor, and part of the first, to guestrooms. The third floor contained a restaurant and bar, and the fourth floor contained a bar, library and other rooms.  The Club also obtained the site of Stanford's former stables, situated just east of the Clubhouse. There, in the early 1970s, it constructed its athletic facilities, including singles and doubles squash courts.&lt;ref&gt;"The University Club of San Francisco Centennial History, 1890–1990" by Mitchell P. Postel,{{ISBN|0-9627540-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, under pressure from anti-discrimination lawsuits and judicial trends, the University Club agreed to accept women as members.

==The Club today==
Membership in the University Club is extended by invitation only, and is limited by its by-laws to no more than 400 members.  The Club has reciprocal membership privileges with over 400&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclubsf.org/Membership/Reciprocal-Clubs.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; clubs worldwide. The Club is listed by the [[Complex (magazine)]] as one of the "10 Exclusive Places In San Francisco You'll Never Get Into", as its "Membership at the "venue for the city's cultural and intellectual life and a worldwide center for the sport of squash is by invitation only and maxes out at 400 people, so if you didn't attend one of our country's prestigious schools, or if you don't know anyone who's a member, leave your racquet at home".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/10/exclusive-places-in-san-francisco-youll-never-get-into/the-university-club| 10 Exclusive Places In San Francisco You'll Never Get Into, the Complex Magazine Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1962 [[Algerian War of Independence]], '''Algerian women''' fought as equals alongside men. They thus achieved a new sense of their own identity and a measure of acceptance from men. In the aftermath of the war, women maintained their new-found emancipation and became more involved in the development of the new state. Among the countries of the region, [[Algeria]] is regarded as a relatively liberal nation and the status of women reflects this.&lt;ref name="Algerian Policewomen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Christian|title=Algeria's women police defy danger and stereotypes|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/06/us-algeria-police-women-idUSTRE5754S420090806|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the constitution guarantees equality between genders, family law discriminates against women. Women can vote and run for political positions.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Slackman|first=Michael|title=Algeria's quiet revolution: Gains by women|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26iht-algeria.1.5876681.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Algeria_(orthographic_projection).svg|thumb|200px|left|Algeria on the map]]
Algeria is a country in [[North Africa]] on the Mediterranean coast. After a prolonged rule by France, Algeria obtained independence from France in 1962.  The [[Algerian Civil War]] (1991-2002) had a negative influence on women's wellbeing. 99% of the population is Arab-Berber, and a similar percentage is Muslim, predominantly Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Algeria, as in the rest of the Middle East, women are traditionally regarded as weaker than men and expected to be subordinate to men. Algeria also has a strong culture of [[family honor]], which is connected to women's modesty.&lt;ref&gt;http://countrystudies.us/algeria/59.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and personal life==
The legal age for marriage is eighteen  for women, twenty-one for men.&lt;ref name="Minimum Legal Age"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Legal Age for Marriage without Consent|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=GenderStat&amp;f=inID:19|publisher=United Nations Data - A World of Information|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Algerian women are getting married and starting families at much older ages than they did under French Rule. Education, work commitment, and changing social attitudes are the reasons for the change.

In 2010, the total fertility rate was 1.76 children born/woman. This is a drop from 2.41 in 2009 and 7.12 in the 1970s just after the [[Algerian War of Independence]] from France.

[[French colonialism|French colonizers]] opposed veiling because of their secular sovereign constitution and the concept of [[Laicite]].  The French secular constitution is based in the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789]], however, which intentionally confers rights in men and denies them to women.

Algerians clung to Islamic veiling under French rule, and after independence actually increased its use.

==Education and employment==
Prior to the country's Independence, very few native Algerian women could read and write. This was the result of a French-imposed ban on Islamic education for the entire native Algerian population. Which also led to the shut down of many schools, until there were barely enough schools to fit the needs of the country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heggoy|first=Alf Andrew|date=1973|title=Education in French Algeria: An Essay on Cultural Conflict|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1186812|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=17|issue=2|pages=180–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The remnants of this policy still manifests today in the significantly low literacy rate found in women over the age of 40.

The [[literacy rate]] of women is still lower than that of men (it is female: 73.1% and male: 87.2%
as of 2015 estimates, population 15 years and older).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Independence, [[North African]] and Algerian women enjoy many more human rights than their counterparts in neighboring and other African countries. Algerian women can inherit property, obtain a divorce, retain custody of their children, gain an education and work in many sectors of society.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; Women make up 70 percent of Algeria’s lawyers and 60 percent of its judges.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; They also dominate the fields of medicine, healthcare and science.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; Increasingly, women contribute more to household income than men.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; As of 2007, sixty-five percent of university students are women, with more than 80% joining the workforce after graduation.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; They are encouraged by family members to become educated and contribute to Algerian society. Algerian women are among the first in North Africa to become taxi and bus drivers.&lt;ref name="Michael Slackman The New York Times 2007"/&gt; Their numbers are also increasing in the police force and security positions.&lt;ref name="Algerian Policewomen"/&gt;

==Role of women in the Algerian War==
{{Main|Women in the Algerian War}}
[[File:Jean Geiser - Femmes de Bou-Saada.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of two Algerian women from Bou Saâda, c. 1906.]]
Women fulfilled a number of different functions during the Algerian War.  The majority of Muslim women who became active participants did so on the side of the National Liberation Front (FLN). The French included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as their Algerian sisters.  The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists a distinction between two different types of women who became involved, urban and rural.  Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord.&lt;ref name="Lazreg, Marnia p. 120"&gt;Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand, the remaining eighty percent, due to their geographic location in respect to the operations of FLN often became involved in the conflict as a result of proximity paired with force.&lt;ref name="Lazreg, Marnia p. 120"/&gt;

Women operated in a number of different areas during the course of the rebellion.  "Women participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turshen |first1=Meredith |title=Algerian Women in the Liberation Struggle and the Civil War: From Active Participants to Passive Victims? |journal=Social Research |date=2002 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=889-911|jstor=40971577}}&lt;/ref&gt; "women assisted the male fighting forces in areas like transportation, communication and administration",&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles.  While the majority of the tasks that women undertook centered on the realm of the non-combatant, those that surrounded the limited number that took part in acts of violence were more frequently noticed. The reality was that "rural women in maquis [rural areas] support networks"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vince |first1=Natalya |title=Transgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion, and "Francaises Musulmanes" during the Algerian War of Independence |journal=French Historical Studies |date=13 September 2010 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=445–474 |doi=10.1215/00161071-2010-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated.  This is not to marginalize those women who did engage in acts of violence but simply to illustrate that they constituted in the minority.
==Education==
Education for both girls and boys are equal (93% and 95% respectively).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Algeria-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011|title=Gender Equality {{!}} UNICEF|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Algerian women account for 53% enrolled in universities, they tend to be more focused on "traditional women careers" such as education and nursing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/discover?query=algeria&amp;z=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=World Bank Group|last=|first=|date=|website=openknowledge.worldbank.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algerian women are allowed to pick whatever career they choose to be in, but social/cultural norms and their husbands are the main obstacles in their way.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/47387b6a0.html|title=Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa - Algeria|work=Refworld|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literacy rate for males are a little higher than female youth (94% and 89%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Overall, the education system is comparably equal, but the problem is if these women break traditional "gender based career roles", there would not be a lot of option for them to be hired.

==Political participation==

Prior to the war of independence, women were in general excluded from the political life. After independence in 1962, where women played an active role, they were badly represented in the building of the new state.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amrane-Minne|first1=Danièle Djamila|title=Women and Politics in Algeria from The War of Independence to Our Day|journal=Research in African Literature|date=1999|volume=30|pages=62-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first National Assembly, there were only 10 women out of the 194 members that were present. These women had all taken part in the war for independence. In the second meeting of the National Assembly, 2 out of 138 members were women.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt; 

The uprising that took place in October 1988 brought in a new a new constitution introducing a multi-party system.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt; This led to the creation of many associations, among them associations for feminists and women in general. These associations made women more visible on the public arena.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt;  The four most visible and important among these associations were “equal rights for men and women”; “the triumph of women’s rights”; “the defence and promotion of women” and “the emancipation of women”.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt;

From 1981 to 1991, women were proportionally represented in the small and marginal parties of the extreme left side.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt; The Workers Party (PT) was led by a woman: Louisa Hanoune.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt;  Both the parties at the left wing and FLN represented women candidates at elections. The religious Islamist parties did not represent women candidates at elections, but women were allowed to be members.&lt;ref name="Amrane-Minne 1999" /&gt;

Today, women are represented, although still not proportionally to men, in both parliament and in ministerial positions. In 2012, Algerian women occupied 31 percent of parliamentary seats, placing the country 26th worldwide and 1st in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations Development Program|title=A future in politics for women in Algeria|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/ourstories/un-avenir-politique-pour-les-femmes-en-algerie.html|website=UNDP|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2012 political reforms were established, with the support of the United Nations Development Program, to provide a legal framework that granted women 30 percent representation in elected assemblies.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; On the local level, the rate is only 18 percent, due to the fact that it is difficult to find women willing to appear on ballots in the communes.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; 

Following President Bouteflika’s re-election in 2014, seven women were appointed as ministers in his cabinet. This adds up to 20 percent of all the ministerial positions. The women occupying the seven new ministerial posts are: Minister of Education Nouria Benghebrit; Minister of Land-Use Planning and Environment Dalila Boudjemaa; Minister of Culture Nadia Labidi; Minister of Family and Women Mounia Meslem; Minister of Post, Information Technology and Communication Zahra Dardouri; Minister of Tourism Nouria Yamina Zerhouni and Delegate Minister of Handicrafts Aish Tabagho &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trade Bridge Consultants|title=President Bouteflika appoints 34 member Cabinet|url=http://tradebridgeconsultants.com/news/reshuffles/president-bouteflika-appoints-34-member-cabinet/|website=Trade Bridge Consultants|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There has until this day not been a female head of state. Louisa Hanoune became the first women in both Algeria and the Arab world to run for office in 2004. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Phillip C.|title=Historical Dictionary of Algeria|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=London|page=228|edition=Fourth|isbn=9780810879195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic participation==

When it comes to owning land, women are at a major disadvantage. Their access to owning land is limited by the traditional laws of Algeria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even through Algerian women by law have the right to access bank loans and are free to negotiate financial or business contracts, these actions are usually restricted by their husbands.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acelebrationofwomen.org/2010/05/gender-equity-womens-issues-algeria/|title=Gender Equity &amp; Women's Issues – Algeria|website=acelebrationofwomen.org|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the workforce accounted for 37% versus men who accounted for 80%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The youth unemployment rate for males (43%) was slight lower than it was for females (46%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 60% of Algerian women are employed, but only half are on a salaried status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Basically speaking, the majority of women do not benefit from their employ ability status. Most Algerian women are employed by public administration and they occupy a lot of the teaching professions and "traditional" women careers in Algeria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "One exception is the medical profession; more than half of Algeria's doctors are women."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/15/136276037/family-law-at-the-crux-of-algerian-womens-futures|title=Family Law Key To Future Of Algerian Women|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2002, the National Committee of Working Women provided a center to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, there has been activists who have been campaigning for there to be a law to protect women from sexual harassment in the workplace.

==Health==

In regards to reproductive services, 96 percent of births were attended by a skilled health staff in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Maternal mortality is still an issue somewhat in Algeria with some differences in different areas of the region. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, maternal mortality rates were cut in half in ten years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The maternal mortality ration in 2010 was 1 in 430 women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In 2011, Algerian women's use of sanitation facilities were at 95.1%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; From the years 2008 to 2011, the number of females who had a comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS at the ages of 15 to 24 years were 13.1%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 68% of women who were between the ages of 15 – 49 years thought that violence by their spouse was acceptable with in some certain situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the people seemed that they did not believe in child marriage and only had 4 total in that year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mothers seeking immunization for newborns and children ranged between 90% to 99% in the year 2012.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/algeria_statistics.html|title=Statistics|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life for women==
When it comes to legal protections for women in Algeria, the current protections in place are general/vague and insufficient. Women activists have had success bringing awareness to change the original family code to a more modernized equivalent benefiting and protecting women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Family Code of 1984 is based on conservative religious principles. While the law was modified by Ordinance No. 05-02 of 27 February 2005, it still maintains many discriminatory provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Family Code of 1984 modified by Ordinance No. 05-02 of 27 February 2005 |url=https://www.equalitynow.org/content/family-code-1984-modified-ordinance-no-05-02-27-february-2005 |website=Equality Now |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708075135/https://www.equalitynow.org/content/family-code-1984-modified-ordinance-no-05-02-27-february-2005 |archivedate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
===Genders===
Nouns are divided into [[Grammatical gender|genders]] or noun classes which can be distinguished by the pronoun used to refer to them and by their suffix, which generally bears some resemblance to the pronoun. If the noun is modified by adjectives, then the suffix appears on the adjectives and not on the noun. The table gives the singular and plural forms of the pronouns used to refer to a noun of each gender. There are also some nouns which have the pronoun ''də'' or ''bə'' without having a plural form.
{| border="1" cellpadding="4" style="text-align:left;"
! Gender
! Includes
|-
! mə
| Mass nouns, liquids and languages
|-
! a / ba
| Most nouns referring to people, kinship terms, personal names, some abstract nouns and borrowings
|-
! ka / sə
| Various nouns, diminutives
|-
! kʊ / i
| Various nouns, augmentatives, territories
|-
! ŋʊ / i
| Long and slender objects
|-
! bə / i
| A small class of semantically diverse nouns
|-
! də / a
| Body parts, material culture, some animals and foods
|-
! kʊ / də
| Tree and plant terms
|-
! də / ba
| A small class of marginal cultural items
|-
! nə
| Only two nouns: ''dɛn'' (today) and ''nən'' (location)
|}

===Word order===
Yom is predominantly an [[SVO language]], although SOV word order is also possible. Genitives precede nouns and relative clauses follow. Adjectives, numerals and demonstratives follow the noun in that order and agree with it in number and gender. Many different constituents can preposed to the beginning of the sentence using a focus construction - for example:
*ma ji ma maŋgoŋʊ, "I am eating my mango"
*ma maŋgoŋʊ ra ma ji ra, "It's my mango that I'm eating"

The name was changed to ''Al Mokhtalat Club''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=bHmEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;lpg=PT135&amp;dq=el+mokhtalat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oZrinPpPV7&amp;sig=uJ-J_4xldtn5ddt3gXms1QmIzuY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc56idvf3YAhWQZlAKHRMvB04Q6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=el%20mokhtalat&amp;f=false|title=''Identity and Nation in African Football: Fans, Community and Clubs''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913 and in 1941 it was changed again to ''King Farouk Club'', named after [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. The name finally settled as ''Zamalek SC'' after the [[1952 Egyptian revolution]]. Zamalek Sporting Club has many sports. Zamalek has won many Olympic and non-Olympic sports alongside football, such as handball, athletics, volleyball and basketball. They have won many local, Arab and African tournaments, participated in world championships and achieved advanced positions.

Zamalek has never been relegated to the [[Egyptian Second Division|Second Division]]. On the continental side, Zamalek has won more [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] trophies than any other African team in the Twentieth century. The club has 5 [[CAF Champions League]] titles, 3 [[CAF Super Cup]] titles and 1 [[African Cup Winners' Cup]] title. Internationally, Zamalek has also won 2 [[Afro-Asian Cup]] titles.

==History==
The club started out as football Club by a Belgian lawyer, Mr. Merzbach on 5 January 1911. It was the first football club in Cairo emerged from its non-English expatriate communities. They formed sports and social clubs each with its own identity. A very important aspect of Zamalek was that it was a club for all people and not for any specific social, economical, or ethnic status. Zamalek started out and continued through World War I under the presidency of Merzbach, and its Belgian secretaries (first Shoduan, then Bochu). The next president was Nicola Arfagi who also played left wing for the club's football team.

Following the 1919 revolution, the club became Egyptian controlled in 1923 under the presidency of General Haidar Pasha and secretary Youssef Mohamad. In the winter of 1924, the club moved for the third time to what is now known as El Balloon Theater. Then in 1940, the club was renamed Farouk El Awal Club after being honored by its acknowledgement from the King of Egypt and Sudan, King Farouk. Following the army coup against the King in 1952, the club was renamed "Al Zamalek" after the area where the club was situated. The club then moved yet again for the fourth time in its history to its final destination on 26 July Street, just 500 meters west of the Zamalek bridge, occupying an area of 35 acres (140,000 m2) and hosting 24 different sports.

In 1917, Egyptian members attempted to form a first Egyptian board for the club, but this was blocked by the President of the club, a Frenchman called M. Piankie and the secretary M. Shoudoi who was Belgian, and as a result, no general members meetings were held for the next few years. The Egyptian members realized that it was important to increase the number of Egyptian members to gain a majority at the next general members meeting. As a result, the elections were held and the first Egyptian board was elected with Dr. Mohammad Badr as President, Mostafa Hassan as Deputy President, Ibrahim Allam as General Secretary, and Nicola Arkaji, Mahmoud Bassyouni, Hussein Fawzy and Abdo El Jabalawy as board members.

After the first board, a new board in 1923 was formed with General Mohammad Haidar as a president. At the beginning of 1941, General Haidar was selected from the assistants of the king. Due to being the favorites of the king, the club's name was changed from AL Moukhtalat to Farouk Al Awal and General Mohammad Haidar stayed as a president at the club for almost thirty years which was unusual at an Egyptian club at the time. ** The biggest victory in the history of the summit [derby] meetings with al ahly and was the biggest result of 6–0 for Zamalek in 1942, 1944 [3] and has not been broken so far since about 75 years.

Then in 1952, the Egyptian army revolution came and a new club's board was formed with Dr. Mohammad Shawky as a president who was also the secretary. He is thwarts team in the world 11 leagues only general of the legislation office with high social status right then. In the same board, there was Mohammad Hassan Helmy who is one of the most popular Zamalek figures taking the position of the secretary assistant. Due to the rules right then, half the club board was changed every year and Mohammad Hassan Helmy took the position of secretary general.

In 1954, the idea of renovating the club stadium was emerging due to the bad state of the current stadium right then. This led the board to look for a businessman to take over the club and thus help in the stadium renovation. Abd El Hamid El Shawarbi took the presidency and, although, he was elected for a second period, he was not able to do the job he wanted. Right then, some Zamalek Faithful figures as General Haidar Pasha, and Haj Sayed El Annany contributed to setting the VIP stand and the first class stand in a way that suits the high status of the club. All of this happened while Abd El Hamid El Shawarbi was outside Egypt, so when he came back. he resigned without helping the club in any aspect and the board continued after Shawky stepped up from his Deputy position (after he left the presidency kindheartedly) to continue till September 1955. Still the idea of bringing a businessman to help the club did not subside, and thus, the famous businessman Abd El Latif Abo Regeila came as the club president in 1956 where by then, the rules have been changed allowing the board to stay for 3 years. And once again, Dr. Shawky steps down for the new businessman; although, he was reelected as a club president and all for the sake of the club's prosperity. Although Abd El Latif Abo Regeila was reelected for a second presidency period, he had to leave Egypt after he lost his money due to the governmental policy against private property (Bus Company and a mansion at Marg which was the hiding place for many players during the season of resignations). But still the club continued to search for another businessman, and Alwe El Gazzar came as a president who was the owner of El Sheikh Sherieb Company and also the president of the board of the Coca-Cola Company right then. Although he was only president for a short period, he was able to bring Real Madrid at his own expense in 1961 to play against Zamalek. But still, he lost his property due to governmental rules and he left Egypt. In 1962, came a new board with Eng. Hassan Amer as a president and emeritus deputy was given to Dr. Mohammad Shawky, Mohammad Lateef, Galal Kereitam, Mahmoud Emam, and Mahmoud Hafez. Eng. Hassan Amer stayed as president till the defeat of Egyptian army in 1967. In 1967, the minister of youth and sports Talat Khairy decided that the club boards will be appointed rather than elected and hence Mohammad Hassan Helmy took the presidency to become the first sportsman in Egypt to become a president of a club. He stayed in presidency till July 1971 where the rules came back to let the board come from elections and not to let anyone to become a president if this person hold presidency for two consecutive boards. Thus came Tawfeek El Kheshen who took the presidency of the board and the honorary presidency was given to Mohammad Hassan Helmy. In 1973, Mohammad Hassan Helmy was elected to become the president and stayed as the head of the board till 1984 and during this period he was continually elected as the president of one of Egypt's biggest clubs. Then in 1984 came the". Eng. Hassan Amer and after him came the Eng. Hasan Abo el Fetouh in 1988. During his period, came a new rule by the ministry of youth increasing the number of elected board members to ten which was removed again in 1990. Eng. Hasan Abo el Fetouh helped in building many of the new building the club is proud of as the gymnasium building which is considered one of the biggest in the Middle East. He also increased the funding for most of the sports teams in the club assisting the winning of many championships during his era.

In 1990, came Galal Ibrhim became the president of the club due to the death of Eng. Hasan Abo el Fetouh. This temporary board was held till September 1990 when the general club meeting was held with the elections of which Eng. "Mohamad Nour El Daly" became the president of the new board till 1992. In 1992, Galal Ibrhim came as the new president of the club. As the rules were changed right then and the vice treasurer was to be selected mostly by the board members, and then Hamada emam was selected by default to that position while [[Abdel Hamid Shaheen]] was elected to the treasurer position. As for the board members, it consisted of: Dr. Ahmed Shereen Fawzy, Mahmoud Marouf, Mohamad Fayez El Zummur, Raouf Gaser, and Tarek Ghonaim. As per the rules, it was also new to have two members of the board under the age of 30. For these two spots, Samy Abo El Kheir and Ihab Ibrahim were elected. As for the appointed members by the high committee for youth and sports, Dr. Mohamad Amer, General Hanafy Reyad, and Farouk Abo El Nasr were added to the board. By 1994, [[Abdel Hamid Shaheen]] was not able to continue his duties due to his sickness, but the board chose to keep him in the position in honor of his devotion to the club, and thus Farouk Abo El Nasr was appointed to take the duties while keeping [[Abdel Hamid Shaheen]] in the position. In 1995, changes came to the board due to the court removal of four members in the board due to their absence from the board meetings for 6 times. These members were Mahmoud Marouf, Mohamad Fayez El Zummur, Dr. Mohamad Amer. The newly appointed members were Mortada Mansour, Mahmoud Abdallah, Mounnir Hassan, and Ibrahim Latif. Still the high committee for youth and sports objected on linking the appointed members with the elected ones and as a result Mounnir Hassan, and Ibrahim Latif forfeited their positions for the better good of the club and to remove any embarrassment happening to the board. And as a surprise, the newly two appointed members for the club board were Dr. Mohamad Amer and Farouk Abo El Nasr in support of their abilities and their dedication. As a result, Dr. Shereen Fawzy was selected to be treasurer till the new elections. On Thursday 4 July, came the decision by Dr. Abd El Menem Emarah to release the club board and the Egyptian Football Federation board after the sad incidence in the game between Ahly and Zamalek season 95/96, as the board decided to freeze the football activity in the club. Meanwhile, the EFF made a series of wrong decisions which caused it to be released too. As a result, a one-year temporary club board was selected of which Dr. Kamal Darweesh was the president and General Abd EL Aziz Kabil was vice president with the board members consisting of General Hanafy Reyad, Magdy Sharaf, Ismail Selim", Azmy megahed, and "Mohamad Abd El Rahman Fawzy. Also, accountant Mahmoud Badr El Deen was appointed as treasurer. Zamalek was named the best club in the world by the IFFHS in February 2003. It was also the first Egyptian team to qualify for the 2001 FIFA Club World Cup in Spain, which was not due to funding problems.

The various administrations have objected to the classification method followed by [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QYD3fFJjHM|title=كمال درويش: نادي  اتفصل للاهلي|first=|last=Media Apple|date=4 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; where did not take into consideration the differences between the three African tournaments, nor did adopt any points for the [[Afro-Asian Club Championship]], although recognized it as an official title later.
