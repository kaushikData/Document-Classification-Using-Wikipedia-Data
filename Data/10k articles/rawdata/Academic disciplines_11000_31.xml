'''12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid''' ('''12-HETE''') is a derivative of the 20 carbon [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], containing a [[Hydroxyl]] residue at carbon 12 and a 5''Z'',''8Z'',10''E'',14''Z'' [[Cis–trans isomerism]] configuration (Z=cis, E=trans) in its four double bonds.  It was first found as a product of [[arachidonic acid]] metabolism made by human and bovine platelets through their 12''S''-[[lipoxygenase]] (i.e. [[ALOX12]]) enzyme(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4215079 | pmc = 433780 | year = 1974 | author1 = Hamberg | first1 = M | title = Prostaglandin endoperoxides.

The two isomers, either directly or after being further metabolized, have been suggested to be involved in a variety of human physiological and pathological reactions.  Unlike [[hormones]] which are secreted by cells, travel in the circulation to alter the behavior of distant cells, and thereby act as [[Endocrine signalling]] agents, these arachidonic acid metabolites act locally as [[Autocrine signalling]] and/or [[Paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate the behavior of their cells of origin or of nearby cells, respectively. In these roles, they may amplify or dampen, expand or contract cellular and tissue responses to disturbances.

== Production ==

In humans, [[Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase]] (12-LO, 12-LOX, ALO12, or platelet type 12-lipoxygenase) is encoded by the [[ALOX12]] gene and expressed primarily in platelets and skin.  ALOX12 metabolizes [[arachidonic acid]] almost exclusively to 12(''S'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(''S'')-HpETE or 12''S''-HpETE).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12432922 | year = 2002 | author1 = Yoshimoto | first1 = T | title = Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenases | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 68–69 | pages = 245–62 | last2 = Takahashi | first2 = Y | doi=10.1016/s0090-6980(02)00034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase]]-1 (15-LO-1, 15-LOX-1, ALOX15), which is expressed in far more tissues that ALOX12, metabolizes arachidonic acid primarily to 15(''S'')-HpETE along with other metabolites of the [[15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]] family; during this metabolism, however, ALOX15 also forms 12(''S'')-HpETE as a minor product.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2010"/&gt;  Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type, also termed 12RLOX and encoded by the [[ALOX12B]] gene, is expressed primarily in skin and cornea; it metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12(''R'')-HpETE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8443245 | year = 1993 | author1 = Oliw | first1 = E.

Sub-primate mammals, such as the mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, and pig, express platelet type 12-lipoxygenase but also a leukocyte type 12-lipoxygenase (also termed 12/15-lipoxygenase, 12/15-LOX or 12/15-LO) which is an [[ortholog]] of, and metabolically equivalent to, human 15-LO-1 in that it forms predominantly 15(''S'')-HpETE with 12(''S'')-HpETE as a minor product.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18258795 | year = 2008 | author1 = Collins | first1 = J.

Sub-human primates, although not extensively examined, appear to have 12-lipoxygenase expression patterns that resemble those of sub-primate mammals or humans depending on the closeness of there genetic relateness to these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20106647 | year = 2010 | author1 = Johannesson | first1 = M | title = Cloning, purification and characterization of non-human primate 12/15-lipoxygenases | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids | volume = 82 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 121–9 | last2 = Backman | first2 = L | last3 = Claesson | first3 = H.

== Further metabolism ==

In human (and mouse) skin epidermis, 12(''R'')-HpETE is metabolized by Epidermis-type lipoxygenase, i.e. eLOX3 (encoded by the [[ALOXE3]] gene), to two products: a) a specific [[hepoxilin]], 8''R''-hydroxy-11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 8''R''-hydroxy,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 or 8''R''-OH,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3) and b) 12-oxo-5''Z'',''8Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-oxo-HETE, 12-oxoETE, 12-Keto-ETE, or 12-KETE); 8''R''-hydroxy,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 is further metabolized by soluble [[Epoxide hydrolase 2]] (sEH) to 8''R'',11''R'',12''R''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.&lt;ref name="J Biol Chem p 21"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17652088 | year = 2007 | author1 = Valmsen | first1 = K | title = A critical role of non-active site residues on cyclooxygenase helices 5 and 6 in the control of prostaglandin stereochemistry at carbon 15 | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 38 | pages = 28157–63 | last2 = Boeglin | first2 = W.

Recent studies indicate that the metabolism by [[ALOXE3]] of the ''R'' stereoisomer of 12-HpETE made by [[ALOX12B]] and therefore possibly the ''S'' stereoisomer of 12-HpETE made by ALOX12 or ALOX15 is responsible for forming various hepoxilins in the epidermis of human and mouse skin and tongue and possibly other tissues.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2013. p 7"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24021977 | pmc = 4116325 | year = 2014 | author1 = Muñoz-Garcia | first1 = A | title = The importance of the lipoxygenase-hepoxilin pathway in the mammalian epidermal barrier | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids | volume = 1841 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–8 | last2 = Thomas | first2 = C.

Human skin metabolizes 12(''S'')-HpETE in reactions strictly analogous to those of 12(''R'')-HpETE; it metabolized 12(''S'')-HpETE by eLOX3 to 8''R''-hydroxy-11''S'',12''S''-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid and 12-oxo-ETE, with the former product then being metabolized by sEH to 8''R'',11''S'',12''S''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.  12(''S'')-HpETE also spontaneously decomposes to a mixture of hepoxilins and trihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (trioxillins) that possess ''R'' or ''S'' hydroxy and ''R'',''S'' or ''S'',''R'' [[epoxide]] residues at various sites while 8''R''-hydroxy,11''S'',12''S''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 spontaneously decomposes to 8''R'',11''S'',12''S''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.&lt;ref name="J Biol Chem p 21"/&gt;

In other tissues and animal species, numerous hepoxilins form but the hepoxilin synthase activity responsible for their formation is variable.  (Hepoxilin A3 [8''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid] and hepoxilin B3 [10(''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-epxoy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid] refer to a mixture of [[Diastereomers]] and⁄or [[Enantiomers]] derived from arachidonic acid.&lt;ref name="Pathophysiology of the hepoxilins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2013. p 7"/&gt;)  Cultured RINm5F rat [[Insulinoma]] cells convert 12(''S'')-HpETE to hepoxilin A3 in a reaction that is completely dependent on, and co-localizes with, the cells' leukocyte type 12-LOX; furthermore, recombinant rat and porcine leukocyte type 12-LOX as well as human platelet type 12-LOX metabolize 12(''S'')-HpETE to hepoxylin A3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15123652 | year = 2004 | author1 = Nigam | first1 = S | title = The rat leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase exhibits an intrinsic hepoxilin A3 synthase activity | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 28 | pages = 29023–30 | last2 = Patabhiraman | first2 = S | last3 = Ciccoli | first3 = R | last4 = Ishdorj | first4 = G | last5 = Schwarz | first5 = K | last6 = Petrucev | first6 = B | last7 = Kühn | first7 = H | last8 = Haeggström | first8 = J.

The majority of reports on hepoxilin formation have not defined the pathways evolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Cellular stress response''' is the wide range of [[molecular biology|molecular]] changes that [[cell (biology)|cells]] undergo in response to environmental [[stressor]]s, including extremes of temperature, exposure to toxins, and mechanical damage. The various processes involved in cellular stress responses serve the [[adaptation|adaptive]] purpose of protecting a cell against unfavorable environmental conditions, both through short term mechanisms that minimize acute damage to the cell's overall integrity, and through longer term mechanisms which provide the cell a measure of resiliency against similar adverse conditions.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welch|first=William|title=How Cells Respond to Stress|date=May 1993|pages=56–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General characteristics ==
Cellular stress responses are primarily mediated through what are classified as ''stress proteins''. Stress proteins often are further subdivided into two general categories: those that only are activated by stress, or those that are involved both in stress responses and in normal cellular functioning. The essential character of these stress proteins in promoting the survival of cells has contributed to them being remarkably well [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across phyla, with nearly identical stress proteins being expressed in the simplest prokaryotic cells as well as the most complex eukaryotic ones.&lt;ref name="Simon Fraser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cell Stress Response|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress proteins can exhibit widely varied functions within a cell- both during normal life processes and in response to stress. For example, studies in [[Drosophila]] have indicated that when DNA encoding certain stress proteins exhibit mutation defects, the resulting cells have impaired or lost abilities such as normal [[mitosis|mitotic]] division and [[proteasome]]-mediated protein degradation. As expected, such cells were also highly vulnerable to stress, and ceased to be viable at elevated temperature ranges.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;

Although stress response pathways are mediated in different ways depending on the stressor involved, cell type, etc., a general characteristic of many pathways{{spaced ndash}} especially ones where heat is the principle stressor{{spaced ndash}} is that they are initiated by the presence and detection of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] proteins. Because conditions such as high temperatures often cause proteins to denature, this mechanism enables cells to determine when they are subject to high temperature without the need of specialized thermosensitive proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milisav|first=Irina|title=Cellular Stress Responses|journal=Advances in Regenerative Medicine|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/23657/InTech-Cellular_stress_responses.pdf | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, if a cell under normal (meaning unstressed) conditions has denatured proteins artificially injected into it, it will trigger a stress response.

== Response to heat ==
{{main|heat shock}}
[[File:Confocal analysis of dermal fibroblasts after heat shock stress (progeria) CROPPED.jpg|370px|thumbnail|right|Cells subjected to heat shock. Cells in slide 'e' exhibit dysmorphic nuclei as a result of this exposure to stress, however 24 hours later cells largely recovered, as shown in slide 'f'.]]
The heat shock response involves a class of stress proteins called [[heat shock proteins]]. These can help defend a cell against damage by acting as 'chaperons' in protein folding so as to ensure proteins assume their necessary shape and do not become denatured and thus useless to the cell.&lt;ref name="Heat Shock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richter|first=Klaus |author2=Martin Haslbeck |author3=[[Johannes Buchner]]|title=The Heat Shock Response: Life on the Verge of Death|journal=[[Molecular Cell]]|date=22 October 2010|volume=40|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510007823|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2010.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role is especially crucial since elevated temperature would, on its own, increase the concentrations of malformed proteins. Heat shock proteins can also participate in marking malformed proteins for degradation via [[ubiquitin]] tags.

== Response to toxins ==
Many toxins end up activating similar stress proteins to heat or other stress-induced pathways because it is fairly common for some types of toxins to achieve their effects - at least in part - by denaturing vital cellular proteins. For example, many heavy metals can react with sulfhydryl groups stabilizing proteins, resulting in conformational changes, and other toxins that either directly or indirectly lead to the release of free radicals can generate misfolded proteins.&lt;ref name="Simon Fraser"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Early research has suggested that cells which are better able to synthesize stress proteins and do so at the appropriate time are better able to withstand damage caused by [[ischemia]] and [[ischemic cascade|reperfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Majmunda|first=Amar|author2=Waihay J. Wong|author3=M. Celeste Simon|title=Hypoxia-Inducible Factors and the Response to Hypoxic Stress|journal=[[Molecular Cell]]|date=22 October 2010|volume=40|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510007501|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.022|pmid=20965423|pmc=3143508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many stress proteins overlap with [[immune system|immune]] proteins. These similarities have medical applications in terms of studying the structure and functions of both immune proteins and stress proteins, as well as the role each plays in combating disease.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;

''Kay Htoe Boe'' is a Karenni ancient dance and prayer festival, held by the men in the [[Kayan people (Myanmar)|Kayan community]] in [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]). In the Kayan [[Creation myth|creation story]], the Eugenia tree is the first tree in the world.

===Middle East===
{{Main|Asherah pole}}
An Asherah pole is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Asherah|Ugaritic mother-goddess Asherah]], [[Spouse|consort]] of [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; the book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains but his conclusions were not well received in the scholarly press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''asherim'' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and thus objects of contention among competing cults. The insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.&lt;ref&gt;John Day, "Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''105'''.3 (September 1986:385-408) p 401; ''asherim'' are discussed pp 401-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of King Josiah, it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp&lt;/ref&gt; such theories inspire ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known as the friend of [[Indra]]. During his reign, Chedi kingdom  introduced ''Shakrotsava'' festival in his kingdom in the honor of Indra. The festival involved planting of a bamboo pole every year, in honor of Indra. The king will then pray for the expansion of his cities and kingdom. After erecting the pole, people decked it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. (1,63).

[[File:Maypole Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing around the maypole, in [[Åmmeberg]], Sweden]]
A [[maypole]] is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on [[May Day]] or [[Pentecost]] ([[Whitsun]]), although in some countries it is instead erected at [[Midsummer]]. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the [[Germanic paganism]]&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russel|first1=Jefferry Burton|title=Medieval Civilisation|orig-year=1968 |date=22 February 2005 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |location=Eugene|isbn=1-59752-103-5|page=243|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=C05LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Iron Age]] and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the [[Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.&lt;ref name="Kelly Cannon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cannon|first1=Kelly|title=Good Neighbor: Former teacher continues tradition of Maypole dance|url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/good-neighbor-former-teacher-continues-tradition-of-maypole-dance/article_43e9b2fb-2f30-54b6-aeb3-34398c645005.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|work=From the Good Neighbors series|agency=The Herald Journal's Staff writer|issue=May 21, 2015|publisher=The Herald Journal, 75 West 300 North Logan, UT|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, [[Germanic paganism]] was followed in various forms, has led to speculation that the maypoles were in some way a continuation of a Germanic pagan tradition.&lt;ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton" /&gt; One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including [[Thor's Oak]] and the [[Irminsul]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Pagan Europe'' by Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-15804-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-15804-6}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Frazer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|date=1922|page=Chapter 10:: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that, in [[Norse paganism]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] views held that the universe was a [[world tree]], known as [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;'The London quarterly review, Volumes 113-114', Theodore Foster, 1863, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The History of Religions' By Hopkins Edward Washburn, The McMillan Company 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''European paganism: the realities of cult from antiquity to the Middle Ages'' by [[Ken Dowden]], Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-12034-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12034-0}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Nart sagas from the Caucasus: myths and legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs' by [[John Colarusso]], Princeton University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-691-02647-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02647-3}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The early history and antiquities of Freemasonry: as connected with ancient Norse guilds, and the oriental and mediæval building fraternities' by George Franklin Fort, Bradley, 1881, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor of the [[Mære Church]], [[Norway]], was excavated in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Lidén, Hans-Emil. 1969. From Pagan Sanctuary to Christian Church, the Excavation of Mære Church in Trøndelag. Norwegian Archaeological Review. (1969) 2, pp. 3–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and found to contain the remains of a pagan cult structure. The nature of that structure was not clear. Lidén felt this represented the remains of a building, but a critique by Olsen (1969:26) in the same work suggested this may have been a site for pole-related rituals. A recent review of the evidence by Walaker (Norddide 2011: 107-113)&lt;ref&gt;Walaker Nordeide, Sæbjorg. 2011.

==Introduction==
CM applied over the life cycle of a system provides visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of system information and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned many fold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and sometimes can have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.

CM emphasizes the functional relation between parts, subsystems, and systems for effectively controlling system change. It helps to verify that proposed changes are systematically considered to minimize adverse effects. Changes to the system are proposed, evaluated, and implemented using a standardized, systematic approach that ensures consistency, and proposed changes are evaluated in terms of their anticipated impact on the entire system. CM verifies that changes are carried out as prescribed and that documentation of items and systems reflects their true configuration. A complete CM program includes provisions for the storing, tracking, and updating of all system information on a component, subsystem, and system basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |title=''Systems Engineering Fundamentals'' |publisher=Defense Acquisition University Press |date=January 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165311/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |archivedate=11 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A structured CM program ensures that documentation (e.g., requirements, design, test, and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate and consistent with the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is not consistent with the item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change. This [[reverse engineering]] process is wasteful in terms of human and other resources and can be minimized or eliminated using CM.

==History==
Configuration Management originated in the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and it is now a standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of [[United States Military Standard|military standards]] called the "480 series" (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the "480 series" was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry [[technical standards]] supported by [[standards organization|standards developing organizations]] (SDO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |title=''Memorandum, Specifications and Standards – A New Way of Doing Business'' |publisher=Secretary of Defense |date=29 June 1994 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021123641/https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, [[ANSI–EIA–649]]–1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/~yang/495ppt/config_management.pdf |title=''Configuration Management Compliance Validation: Critical Review and Technology Assessment(CR/TA)Report'' |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |date= |accessdate=14 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include [[systems engineering]] (SE), [[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS), [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI), [[ISO 9000]], [[Prince2]] project management method, [[COBIT]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL), [[product lifecycle management]], and [[Application Lifecycle Management]].  Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.

==Overview==

CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a [[system]] maintains its [[system integrity | integrity]] over time. CM implements the policies, procedures, techniques, and tools that manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes. CM programs and plans provide technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation of the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes, and resources required to successfully develop and support a complex system. During system development, CM allows [[program management]] to track requirements throughout the life-cycle through acceptance and operations and maintenance. As changes inevitably occur in the requirements and design, they must be approved and documented, creating an accurate record of the system status. Ideally the CM process is applied throughout the [[system lifecycle]]. Most professionals mix up or get confused with [[Asset management]] (AM), where it inventories the assets on hand. The key difference between CM and AM is that the former does not manage the financial accounting aspect but on service that the system supports.

The CM process for both hardware- and software-configuration items comprises five distinct disciplines as established in the MIL–HDBK–61A&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
and in ANSI/EIA-649. These disciplines are carried out{{by whom?|date=July 2016}} as policies and procedures for establishing [[Baseline_(configuration_management)|baselines]] and for performing a standard [[change management | change-management]] process.  The [[IEEE 12207]] process IEEE 12207.2 also has these activities and adds "Release management and delivery".

The five disciplines are:

# CM Planning and Management: a formal document and plan to guide the CM program that includes items such as: 
#* personnel
#* responsibilities and resources
#* training requirements
#* administrative meeting guidelines, including a definition of procedures and tools
#* baselining processes
#* configuration control and configuration-status accounting
#* naming conventions
#* audits and reviews
#* subcontractor/vendor CM requirements
# Configuration Identification (CI): consists of setting and maintaining baselines, which define the system or subsystem architecture, components, and any developments at any point in time. It is the basis by which changes to any part of a system are identified, documented, and later tracked through design, development, testing, and final delivery. CI incrementally establishes and maintains the definitive current basis for Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) of a system and its [[configuration item]]s (CIs) throughout their lifecycle (development, production, deployment, and operational support) until disposal.
# Configuration Control: includes the evaluation of all change-requests and change-proposals, and their subsequent approval or disapproval. It covers the process of controlling modifications to the system's design, hardware, firmware, software, and documentation.
# Configuration Status Accounting: includes the process of recording and reporting configuration item descriptions (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, etc.) and all departures from the baseline during design and production. In the event of suspected problems, the verification of baseline configuration and approved modifications can be quickly determined.
# Configuration Verification and Audit: an independent review of hardware and software for the purpose of assessing compliance with established performance requirements, commercial and appropriate military standards, and functional, allocated, and product baselines. Configuration audits verify that the system and subsystem configuration documentation complies with the functional and physical performance characteristics before acceptance into an architectural baseline.

==Software==
{{main|Software configuration management}}

The traditional software configuration management (SCM) process is looked upon by practitioners as the best solution to handling changes in software projects. It identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.

The SCM process further defines the need to trace changes, and the ability to verify that the final delivered software has all of the planned enhancements that are supposed to be included in the release. It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are:
#Configuration identification
#Configuration control
#Configuration status accounting
#Configuration audits

These terms and definitions change from standard to standard, but are essentially the same.

*Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item.  A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose.  These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. [[Baseline (configuration management)|Baselining]] an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.
*Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them.
*Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time.
*Configuration audits are broken into functional and [[physical configuration audit]]s.  They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change.  A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation.

=== Configuration management database ===
The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL) specifies the use of a Configuration management system (CMS) or [[Configuration management database]] (CMDB) as a means of achieving industry best practices for Configuration Management.  CMDBs are used to track Configuration Items (CIs) and the dependencies between them, where CIs represent the things in an enterprise that are worth tracking and managing, such as but not limited to computers, software, software licenses, racks, network devices, storage, and even the components within such items.

The benefits of a CMS/CMDB includes being able to perform functions like root cause analysis, impact analysis, change management, and current state assessment for future state strategy development. Example systems, commonly identifies themselves as [[IT service management|IT Service Management (ITSM)]] systems, include FreshService, ServiceNow and Samanage.

=== Information assurance ===
For [[information assurance]], CM can be defined as the management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to hardware, software, firmware, documentation, test, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the life cycle of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Information Systems Security Glossary]]&lt;/ref&gt; CM for information assurance, sometimes referred to as '''S'''ecure '''C'''onfiguration '''M'''anagement, relies upon performance, functional, and physical attributes of IT platforms and products and their environments to determine the appropriate security features and assurances that are used to measure a system configuration state. For example, configuration requirements may be different for a [[network firewall]] that functions as part of an organization's Internet boundary versus one that functions as an internal local [[network firewall]].

==Maintenance systems==

Configuration management is used to maintain an understanding of the status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of serviceability for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.

In the military, this type of activity is often classed as "mission readiness", and seeks to define which assets are available and for which type of mission; a classic example is whether aircraft on board an aircraft carrier are equipped with bombs for ground support or missiles for defense.

===Operating System configuration management===
Configuration management can be used to maintain [[Operating system|OS]] configuration files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Lueninghoener|title=Getting Started with Configuration Management. ;login: issue:  April 2011, Volume 36, Number 2|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/105457-Lueninghoener.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example systems include [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]], [[Bcfg2]], [[CFEngine]], [[Chef (software)|Chef]], [[Otter (software)|Otter]], [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]], [[Quattor]], [[SaltStack]], and [[Vagrant (software)|Vagrant]]. Many of these systems utilize [[Infrastructure as Code]] to define and maintain configuration.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite magazine

===Preventive maintenance===
{{Main|Preventive maintenance}}
Understanding the "as is" state of an asset and its major components is an essential element in preventive maintenance as used in maintenance, repair, and overhaul and [[enterprise asset management]] systems.

Complex assets such as aircraft, ships, industrial machinery etc. depend on many different components being serviceable. This serviceability is often defined in terms of the amount of usage the component has had since it was new, since fitted, since repaired, the amount of use it has had over its life and several other limiting factors. Understanding how near the end of their life each of these components is has been a major undertaking involving labor-intensive record keeping until recent developments in software.

===Predictive maintenance===
{{Main|Predictive maintenance}}
Many types of component use electronic sensors to capture data which provides live [[condition monitoring]]. This data is analyzed on board or at a remote location by computer to evaluate its current serviceability and increasingly its likely future state using algorithms which predict potential future failures based on previous examples of failure through field experience and modeling. This is the basis for "predictive maintenance".

Availability of accurate and timely data is essential in order for CM to provide operational value and a lack of this can often be a limiting factor. Capturing and disseminating the operating data to the various support organizations is becoming an industry in itself.

The consumers of this data have grown more numerous and complex with the growth of programs offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These are designed to offer operators guaranteed availability and make the picture more complex with the operator managing the asset but the OEM taking on the liability to ensure its serviceability.

==Construction==
More recently configuration management has been applied to large construction projects which can often be very complex and have a huge amount of details and changes that need to be documented. Construction agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration have used configuration management for their infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management for Transportation Management Systems Handbook''|work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.everyspec.com/DOT/FHWA-OP-04-013_SEP2003_41209/ |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are construction-based configuration management tools that aim to document change orders and RFIs in order to ensure a project stays on schedule and on budget. These programs can also store information to aid in the maintenance and modification of the infrastructure when it is completed.  One such application, ccsNet, was tested in a case study funded by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) in which the efficacy of configuration management was measured through comparing the approximately 80% complete construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency (LACMTA) 1st and 2nd segments of the Red Line, a $5.3&amp;nbsp;billion rail construction project.  This study yielded results indicating a benefit to using configuration management on projects of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management Case Study''|work=PACO Technologies, Inc|url=http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826174139/http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|archivedate=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Cynical realism''' is a [[contemporary art|contemporary]] movement in [[Chinese art]], especially in the form of [[painting]], that began in the 1990s. Beginning in [[Beijing]], it has become one of the most popular Chinese [[contemporary art]] movements in [[mainland China]]. It arose through the pursuit of individual expression by Chinese artists who broke away from the collective mindset that existed since the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The major themes tend to focus on [[socio-political]] issues and events since [[Revolutionary China]] (1911) to the present. These include having a usually humorous and [[post-irony|post-ironic]] take on a realist perspective and interpretation of the transition that Chinese society has been through, from the advent of [[Communism]] to today's [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]].

Artists associated with Cynical Realism include [[Fang Lijun]], [[Liu Wei (artist)|Liu Wei]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gunde, ''Culture and Customs of China'', Greenwood Press, 2002, p83. {{ISBN|0-313-30876-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yue Minjun]].&lt;ref&gt;Damian Harper, ''China'', Lonely Planet, 2005, p62. {{ISBN|1-74059-687-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2761">The '''Development Studies Association''' ('''DSA''') is the largest and most coherent national platform for development studies in the world. It is regarded as an influential network with a key role to play through its membership and convening power, internationally as well as nationally. It facilitates access to world leading research on development and its application to policy and practice.

The DSA aims to advance knowledge of the alternative processes and methods of socio-economic change, through supporting high quality research, teaching and practice in international development.  Its strategic objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;
i) Mobilise collective capacity and knowledge&lt;br/&gt;
ii) Nurture the next generation&lt;br/&gt;
iii) Invest in development infrastructure in the UK and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;

Two key activities are its annual conference and its study groups.

The DSA annual conference gathers together scholars, practitioners, policy makers and other commentators to focus upon major contemporary international development issues in the largest gathering in the UK of the development community.

DSA Study Groups facilitate interaction and networking within the development studies community and encourage the development of new ideas contributing to ongoing debates about development in the UK and Ireland.  The study groups are sustained by active development studies professionals and usually meet at the Annual Conference and at specially convened meetings around the country.

The DSA was founded in 1978 and currently has 35 institutional members (primarily UK University departments/research centres with some development organisations) and 400 individual and student members.  It is governed by a Council made up of academics and practitioners working in international development elected at the Annual General Meeting.

'''Document mosaicing''' is a process that stitches multiple, overlapping [[wikt:snaphot|snapshot]] images of a document together in order to produce one large, high resolution composite. The document is slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the document are snapshotted by the camera’s field of view. As the document slid under the camera, all motion of the document is coarsely tracked by the vision system. The document is periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document.&lt;ref name="MyRef2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthony | first=Zappalá |author2=Andrew Gee|author3=Michael Taylor
| title = Document mosaicing | journal = Image and Vision Computing
| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885698001784

The document mosaicing can be divided into four main processes.
*Tracking
*Feature detecting
*Correspondences establishing
*Images mosaicing.

== Tracking (simple correlation process) ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Document tracking.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''' : The correlation pattern mirrors the text rows. The template is continuously updated so that an incorrect correlation peak results in mild tracking inaccuracy and not total failure.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]] --&gt;
In this process, the motion of the document slid under the camera is coarsely tracked by the system. Tracking is performed by a process called simple [[correlation]] process. In the first frame of snapshots, a small patch is extracted from the center of the image 
as a correlation template as shown in Figure 1. The correlation process is performed in the four times size of the patch area of the next frame. The motion of the paper is indicated by the peak in the correlation function. The peak in the correlation function indicates the motion of the paper. The template is resampled from this frame and the tracking continues until the template reaches the edge of the document. After the template reaches the edge of the document, another snapshot is taken and the tracking process performs repeatedly until the whole document is imaged. The snapshots are stored in an ordered list in order to pair the overlapped images in later processes.s

== Feature detecting for efficient matching ==
Feature detection is the process of finding the transformation which aligns one image with another. There are two main approaches for feature detection.&lt;ref name="MyRef3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=S. | first=Mann |author2=R.W. Picard

 }}
* '''Feature-based approach''' : Motion parameters are estimated from point correspondences. This approach is suitable for the case that there is plenty supply of stable and detectable features.
* '''Featureless approach''' : When the motion between the two images is small, the motion parameters are estimated using [[optical flow]]. On the other hand, when the motion between the two images is large, the motion parameters are estimated using generalised [[cross-correlation]]. However, this approach requires a computationally expensive resources.

Each image is segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words in order to match with the organised sets of features across images. Skew angle estimation and columns, lines and words finding are the examples of feature detection operations.

=== Skew angle estimation ===

Firstly, the angle that the rows of text make with the image [[Raster graphics|raster]] lines (skew angle) is estimated. It is assumed to lie in the range of ±20°. A small patch of text in the image is selected randomly and then rotated in the range of ±20° until the variance of the pixel intensities of the patch summed along the raster lines is maximised.&lt;ref name="MyRef5"&gt;{{cite journal | last=D.S. | first=Bloomberg |author2=G.E. Kopec |author3=L. Dasari
| title =  Measuring document image skew and orientation | journal = SPIE
| url=http://www.leptonica.com/papers/skew-measurement.pdf|year= 1995 | volume=2422 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 2.

In order to ensure that the found skew angle is accurate, the document mosaic system performs calculation at many image patches and derive the final estimation by finding the average of the individual angles weighted by the variance of the pixel intensities of each patch.

=== Columns, lines and words finding ===

In this operation, the de-skewed document is intuitively segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words. The sensitivity to illumination and page coloration of the de-skewed document can be removed by applying a [[Sobel operator]] to the de-skewed image and thresholding the output to obtain the binary gradient, de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=M.J. | first=Taylor|author2=J. Lee
| title =  Interactive text segmentation of greyscale images of documents | journal = Technical Report EPC, Rank Xerox Research Centre
| year= 1997 | volume=104 | issue=Document Recognition II | pages=302–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 3.

The operation can be roughly separated into 3 steps : column segmentation, line segmentation and word segmentation.

# Columns are easily segmented from the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images by summing pixels vertically as shown in Figure 4.
# Baselines of each row are segmented in the same way as the column segmentation process but horizontally.
# Finally, individual words are segmented by applying the vertical process at each segmented row.

These segmentations are important because the document mosaic will be created by matching the lower right corners of words in overlapping images pair. Moreover, the segmentation operation can organize the list of images in the context of a hierarchy of rows and column reliably.

The segmentation operation involves a considerable amount of summing in the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed images, which done by construct a matrix of partial sums&lt;ref name="MyRef7"&gt;{{cite book | last= F.P.| first=Preparata|author2=M.I. Shamos
| title =  Computational Geometry: An Introduction | publisher = Springer–Verlag | series = Monographs in Computer Science
| url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-0-387-96131-6|year= 1985| isbn=9780387961316}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose elements are given by

&lt;math&gt;p_{iy}=\sum_{u=1}^{i}\sum_{v=1}^{j}b_{uv}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The matrix of partial sums is calculated in one pass through the binary [[gradient]], de-skewed image.&lt;ref name="MyRef7" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{u=u_{1}}^{u_{2}}\sum_{v=v_{1}}^{v_{2}}b_{uv}=p_{u_{2}v_{2}}+p_{u_{1}v_{1}}-p_{u_{1}v_{2}}-p_{u_{2}v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Correspondences establishing ==
The two images are now organized in hierarchy of linked lists in following structure :
* image   = list of columns
* row       = list of words
* column = list of row
* word     = length (in pixels)

At the bottom of the structure, the length of each word is recorded for establishing correspondence between two images in order to reduce to search only the corresponding structures for the groups of words with the matching lengths.

=== Seed match finding ===

A seed match finding is done by comparing each row in image1 with each row in image2. The two rows are then compared to each other by every word. If the length (in pixel) of the two words (one from image1 and one from image2) and their immediate neighbours agree with each other within a predefined tolerance threshold (5 pixels, for example), then they are assumed to be matched. The row of each image is assumed to be matched if there are three or more word matches between the two rows. The seed match finding operation is terminated when two pairs of consecutive row match are found.

=== Match list building ===

After finishing a seed match finding operation, the next process is to build the match list to generate the correspondences points of the two images. The process is done by searching the matching pairs of rows away from the seed row.

== Images mosaicing ==
[[File:Mosaicing.png|thumb|'''Figure 5''' : Mosaicing of two document images. Blurring is evident in the affine mosaic (b), but not in the mosaic constructed using a plane-to-plane projectivity (a). Close-ups of typical seams of (a) and (b) are shown in (c) and (d) respectively.&lt;ref name="MyRef2" /&gt;]]

Given the list of corresponding points of the two images, finding the transformation of the overlapping portion of the images is next process to be performed. Assuming a [[pinhole camera]] model, the transformation between pixels (u,v) of image 1 and pixels (u0, v0) of image 2 is demonstrated by a plane-to-plane projectivity.&lt;ref name="MyRef8"&gt;{{cite book | last=J.L. | first=Mundy|author2=A. Zisserman

| year= 1981 | doi=10.1145/358669.358692}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique is used to reject outlying matches and estimate the projectivity from the remaining good matches.

The projectivity is fine-tuned using correlation at the corners of the overlapping portion in order to obtain four correspondences to sub-pixel accuracy. Therefore, image1 is then transformed into image2’s coordinate system using Eq.1. The typical result of the process is shown in Figure 5.

=== Many images coping ===

Finally, the whole page composition is built up by mapping all the images into the coordinate system of an “anchor” image, which is normally the one nearest the page center. The transformations to the anchor frame are calculated by concatenating the pair-wise transformations which found earlier. The raw document mosaic is shown in Figure 6.

However, there might be a problem of non-consecutive images that are overlap. This problem can be solved by performing Hierarchical sub-mosaics. As shown in Figure 7, image1 and image2 are registered, as are image3 and image4, creating two sub-mosaics. These two sub-mosaics are later stitched together in another mosaicing process.

The '''EUR-ACE (European Accredited Engineer)''' Label is a certificate awarded to courses of study in Engineering that are accredited by authorized quality assurance and accreditation agencies in the [[European Higher Education Area]]. 

The [[European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education]] (ENAEE) grants this authorization to agencies that accredit degree programs in Engineering in accordance with the European Framework Standards and ENAEE's Standards for Accreditation Agencies.

The EUR-ACE label may be awarded to First Cycle (Bachelor) and Second Cycle (Master) accredited degrees in [[Engineering]].

==History==

The European Standing Observatory for the Engineering Profession and Education (ESOEPE) was established in September 2000. Its aim was to improve systems of accreditation of engineering degree programs in Europe.

In 2004 ESOEPE submitted a proposal to the European Commission. This proposal envisaged the establishment of a quality label (the EUR-ACE Label) which could be awarded to engineering degree programs which had reached certain educational standards, as defined by their learning outcomes.

The proposal was accepted by the EU Commission and funding provided for the project.
ESOEPE was dissolved; ENAEE was established and implemented the EUR-ACE Project.

The EUR-ACE Project concluded on 31/03/2006 with the presentation of the results in a public workshop in which the EUR-ACE label was listed among the six EC-sponsored “European quality labels in higher education”.
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecaconsortium.net/event/paris/doc/WG4-ECA position paper&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to using learning outcomes in the ENAEE European Framework Standards has been corroborated in a number of publications and projects since the establishment of ENAEE.

As of 19 November 2014, authorized agencies sign a Mutual Recognition Agreement whereby they  accept each other's accreditation decisions in respect of Bachelor and Master engineering degree programs which they accredit.

==Agencies authorised to award the EUR-ACE label==

As of 21 November 2017 ENAEE had authorised 15 agencies to award the EUR-ACE label, which has been awarded to some 2600 engineering degree programmes in 35 countries both within and outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enaee.trynisis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ecosan smaller.jpg|thumb|Ecosan concept showing a separation of flow streams, treatment and reuse]]

'''Ecological sanitation''', commonly abbreviated as '''ecosan''' (also spelled '''eco-san''' or '''EcoSan'''), is an approach to [[sanitation]] provision which aims to safely [[Reuse of excreta|reuse excreta]] in [[agriculture]]. It desires to "close the loop" mainly for the [[plant nutrient|nutrients]] and [[organic matter]] between sanitation and agriculture. One of the aims is to minimise the use of [[non-renewable resource]]s. When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Definition ==
The definition of ecosan has varied in the past. In 2012, a widely accepted definition of ecosan was formulated by Swedish experts: "Ecological [[sanitation]] systems are systems which allow for the safe recycling of nutrients to crop production in such a way that the use of [[non-renewable resource]]s is minimized. These systems have a strong potential to be [[sustainable sanitation]] systems if technical, institutional, social and economic aspects are managed appropriately."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Elisabeth Kvarnström, Linus Dagerskog, Anna Norström and Mats Johansson (2012) [http://www.siani.se/resources/report/nutrient-reuse-solution-multiplier Nutrient reuse as a solution multiplier] (SIANI policy brief 1.1), A policy brief by the SIANI Agriculture-Sanitation Expert Group, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2012, ecosan has often been associated with [[urine diversion]] and in particular with [[urine-diverting dry toilet|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]], a type of [[dry toilet]]. For this reason, the term "ecosan toilet" is widely used when people mean a UDDT.&lt;ref&gt;Rieck, C., von Münch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) - Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs]. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ecosan concept should not be limited to one particular type of toilet. Also, UDDTs can be used without having any reuse activities in which case they are not in line with the ecosan concept (an example being the 80,000 UDDTs implemented by eThekwini Municipality near Durban, South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;Roma, E., Holzwarth, S., Buckley, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/791 Large-scale peri-urban and rural sanitation with UDDTs, eThekwini Municipality (Durban), South Africa] - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Use of the term "ecosan" ===
The term "ecosan" was first used in 1995 and the first project started 1996 in Ethiopia, by an NGO called Sudea. A trio, Dr Torsten Modig, Umeå University, Almaz Terrefe, teamleader, and Gunder Edström, hygiene expert, chose an area in a dense urban area as a starting point.They used urine diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) coupled with reuse activities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the ecosan concept, human [[excreta]] and [[wastewater]] is regarded as a potential resource – which is why it has also been called "resource oriented sanitation". The term "productive sanitation" has also been in use since about 2006.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Comparison with the term "sustainable sanitation" ===
The definition of ecosan is focusing on the health, environment and resource aspect of [[sustainable sanitation]]. Thus ecosan is not, per se, sustainable sanitation, but ecosan systems can be implemented in a sustainable way and have a strong potential for sustainable sanitation, if technical, institutional, social and economical aspects are cared for appropriately. Ecosan systems can be "unsustainable" for example if there is too little user acceptance or if the costs of the system are too high for a given target group of users, making the system financially unsustainable in the longer term.

==Overview==

[[File:EcoSanRes (2005). Closing the loop on Sanitation..jpg|thumb|Poster by EcoSanRes program: Closing the loop on Sanitation (2005)]]

[[File:Ecosan closing the loop poster by CREPA.jpg|thumb|Ecosan closing the loop poster (in French), by the NGO CREPA in 2005, UDDTs are used in this example]]The main objectives of ecological sanitation are to reduce the health risks related to sanitation, [[contaminated water]] and waste; to prevent [[groundwater pollution]] and [[surface water]] pollution; and to reuse nutrients or energy contained within wastes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book | author=GTZ, IWA | year=2003 | title=Ecosan - closing the loop - Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium, 7th–11th April 2003, Lübeck, Germany | publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH and International Water Association (IWA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource recovery ===
{{Further|Resource recovery}}
The statement in the definition of ecosan to "safely recycle" includes hygienic, microbial and chemical aspects. Thus, the recycled human excreta product, in solid or liquid form, shall be of high quality both concerning pathogens and all kind of hazardous chemical components. The statement "use of non-renewable resources is minimised" means that the gain in resources by recycling shall be larger than the cost of resources by recycling.

Ecosan is based on an overall concept of material flows as part of an ecologically and economically sustainable wastewater management system tailored to the needs of the users and to the respective local conditions. It does not favour a specific sanitation technology, but is rather a certain philosophy in handling substances that have so far been seen simply as wastewater and water-carried waste for disposal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Reuse as fertilizer ====
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Right from the start, the first proponents of ecosan systems had a strong focus on increasing agricultural productivity (via the [[reuse of excreta]] as [[fertilizer]]s) and thus improving the nutritional status of the people at the same time as providing them with safe sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;Esrey, S., Andersson, I., Hillers, A., Sawyer, R. (2001). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/788 Closing the Loop - Ecological sanitation for food security]. Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Disease reduction was meant to be achieved not only by reducing infections transmitted via the [[fecal-oral route]] but also by reducing [[malnutrition in children]]. This link between [[WASH]], nutrition, a disease called environmental enteropathy (or tropical [[enteropathy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = J. H. | year = 2009 | title = Child undernutrition, tropical enteropathy, toilets, and handwashing | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1792 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9694| pages = 1032–1035 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60950-8 | pmid=19766883}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[stunted growth]] of children has risen to the top of the agenda of the [[WASH]] sector since about 2013.

Agricultural trials around the world have shown measurable benefits of using treated excreta in agriculture as a fertilizer and [[soil conditioner]]. This applies in particular to the use of [[urine]]. Reuse trials in [[Zimbabwe]] showed positive results for using urine on green, leafy plants such as spinach or maize as well as fruit trees.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Morgan, P. (2010).

[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1285 Trees as recyclers of nutrients present in human excreta - Main tree report]. Aquamor,  and Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in Finland indicated that the use of urine and the use of urine and wood ash "could produce 27% and 10% more red beet root biomass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Surendra K.|title=Human Urine and Wood Ash as Plant Nutrients for Red Beet (Beta vulgaris) Cultivation: Impacts on Yield Quality|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=58|issue=3|pages=2034–2039|doi=10.1021/jf9029157|pmid=20050665|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urine has been proven in many studies to be a valuable, relatively easy to handle fertilizer, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and important micro-nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Richert, A., Gensch, R., Jönsson, H., Stenström, T., Dagerskog, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/757 Practical guidance on the use of urine in crop production]. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus recovery ====
Another aspect that ecosan systems are trying to address is the possible upcoming shortage of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, J., Cordell, D., Smit, A., Rosemarin, A. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1587 Sustainable use of phosphorus]. Plant Research International, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus has an important role for plant growth, and therefore in fertilizer production, but is a limited mineral resource.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1591 A rock and hard place - Peak phosphorus and the threat to our food security]. Soil Association, Bristol, UK&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is similar for potassium. Known mineral phosphate rock reserves are becoming scarce and increasingly costly to extract – this is also called the "[[peak phosphorus]]" crisis. One review of global phosphate supply suggested that if collected, phosphate in urine could supply 22% of the total demand.&lt;ref name="MihelcicFry2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mihelcic|first1=James R.|last2=Fry|first2=Lauren M.|last3=Shaw|first3=Ryan|title=Global potential of phosphorus recovery from human urine and feces|journal=Chemosphere|volume=84|issue=6|year=2011|pages=832–839|issn=0045-6535|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.046|pmid=21429554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Benefits of ecosan systems include:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* Minimizing the introduction of [[pathogen]]s from human excreta into the [[water cycle]] (groundwater and surface water) - for example [[groundwater pollution]] by [[pit latrine]]s.  
* Conservation of resources through lower water consumption, substitution of mineral fertilizer and minimization of [[water pollution]].
*  Less reliance on mined phosphorus and other non-renewable resources for fertilizer production.
* Reduced consumption of energy in fertilizer production: [[Urea]] is a major component of urine, yet we produce vast quantities of urea by using [[fossil fuels]]. By properly managing urine, treatment costs as well as fertilizer costs can be reduced.

==Challenges==
The ecosan approach has been criticised for being overly focused on reuse in agriculture, whilst neglecting some of the other criteria for [[sustainable sanitation]]. In fact, ecosan systems can be "unsustainable", for example, if there is too little user acceptance or if the costs of the system are too high for a given target group of users, making the system financially unsustainable in the longer term.

Some proponents of ecosan have been criticised as being too dogmatic, with an over-emphasis on environmental resource protection rather than a focus on public health protection and provision of sanitation at a very low cost (for example [[Urine-diverting dry toilet|UDDTs]], which some people call "ecosan toilets", may be more expensive to build than pit latrines, even if in the longer term they are cheaper to maintain).

The safety of ecosan systems in terms of pathogen destruction during the various treatment processes is a continuous topic of debate between proponents and opponents of ecosan systems. However, the publication of the WHO Guidelines on Reuse, with its multiple barrier concept, has gone a long way in establishing a common framework for safe reuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the question remains whether ecosan systems can ever be scaled up to reach millions of people and how they can be made sufficiently safe to operate. The initial excitement in the early 2000s by the ecosan pioneers has changed into a realization that changing attitudes and behaviours in sanitation takes a lot of patience.

Acknowledgement for ecosan came with the awarding of the&amp;nbsp;[[Stockholm Water Prize]]''' '''in 2013 to Peter Morgan, a pioneer of handpumps and ventilated pit latrines (VIPs) in addition to ecosan-type toilets&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, P. (2007). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/195 Toilets That Make Compost - Low-cost, sanitary toilets that produce valuable compost for crops in an African context]. Stockholm Environment Institute, {{ISBN|978-9-197-60222-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Arborloo]], the Skyloo and the Fossa alterna). Peter Morgan is renowned as one of the leading creators and proponents of ecological sanitation solutions, which enable the safe [[Reuse of excreta|reuse of human excreta]] to enhance soil quality and crop production. His ecosan-type toilets are now in use in countries across the globe, centred on converting a sanitary problem into a productive resource.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Also many of the research projects that the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have been funding since about 2011 in sanitation are dealing with resource recovery – this might well be a legacy of the ecosan concept, even if the term "ecosan" is not used by these researchers.

== Technologies used in ecosan systems ==
[[File:Possible technology components for sustainable sanitation.jpg|thumb|Possible technology components for sustainable sanitation, of which ecosan is a sub-set focussing on the reuse possibilities]]

Ecosan offers a flexible framework, where centralised elements can be combined with decentralised ones, waterborne with dry sanitation, [[high-tech]] with [[low-tech]], etc. By considering a much larger range of options, optimal and economic solutions can be developed for each particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jenssen, P., Heeb, J., Huba-Mang, E., Gnanakan, K., Warner, W., Refsgaard, K., Stenström, T., Guterstam, B., Alsen, K. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/184 Ecological Sanitation and Reuse of Wastewater - A thinkpiece on ecological sanitation.] The Agricultural University of Norway&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies used in ecosan systems often - but not always - include elements of source separation, i.e. keeping different waste streams separate, as this can make treatment and safe reuse easier.

The most common technology used in ecosan systems is the [[urine-diverting dry toilet]], but ecosan systems can also use other technologies, such as vacuum toilets coupled with [[biogas]] plants, [[constructed wetland]]s, [[composting toilet]]s and so forth.

Examples of ecosan projects worldwide can be found in a list published by [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] in 2012, as well as in those case studies published by the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] that are focused on reuse activities.&lt;ref&gt;GIZ (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1423 Worldwide list of 324 documented ecosan projects by various organisations]. Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/case-studies|title = Case studies of sustainable sanitation projects|date = 2013|accessdate = 18 October 2014|website = |publisher = Sustainable Sanitation Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}

=== Excreta reuse in dry sanitation systems ===

The recovery and use of urine and feces in "dry [[sanitation]] systems", i.e. without sewers or without mixing substantial amounts of water with the excreta, has been practiced by almost all cultures. The reuse was not limited to agricultural production. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], for example, were aware of the [[bleach]]ing attribute of the [[ammonia]] within urine and used it to whiten clothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many traditional agricultural societies recognized the value of human waste for [[soil fertility]] and practised the "dry" collection and [[reuse of excreta]]. This enabled them to live in communities in which nutrients and organic matter contained in excreta were returned to the soil. Historical descriptions about these practices are sparse, but it is known that excreta reuse was practiced widely in Asia (for example in China, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Korea) but also in Central and South America. However, the most renowned example of the organised collection and use of human excreta to support food production is that of China.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, AD (2003). Feed or feedback: agriculture, population dynamics and the state the planet. International Books. Utrecht, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90 5727 048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of "[[night soil]]" as a fertilizer was recognized with well-developed systems in place to enable the collection of excreta from cities and its transportation to fields. The Chinese were aware of the benefits of using excreta in crop production more than 2500 years ago, enabling them to sustain more people at a higher density than any other system of agriculture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Mexico the [[Aztec]] culture collected human excreta for agricultural use. One example of this practice has been documented for the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was founded in 1325 and was one of the last cities of pre-Hispanic Mexico (conquered in 1521 by the Spanish): The population placed the sweepings in special boats moored at docks around the city. Mixtures of sweepings and excreta were used to fertilize the chinampas (agricultural fields) or to bolster the banks bordering the lake. Urine was collected in containers in all houses, then mixed with mud and used as a fabric dye. The Aztecs recognized the importance of recycling nutrients and compounds contained in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becerril | first1 = J.

In Peru, the Incas had a high regard for excreta as a fertilizer, which was stored, dried and pulverized to be utilized when planting maize.&lt;ref name="Luethi book"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lüthi|first1 = C.|title = Sustainable sanitation in cities : a framework for action|date = 2011|publisher = Papiroz Publ.

In the Middle Ages, the use of excreta and [[greywater]] in agricultural production was the norm. European cities were rapidly urbanizing and sanitation was becoming an increasingly serious problem, whilst at the same time the cities themselves were becoming an increasingly important source of agricultural nutrients. The practice of directly using the nutrients in excreta and wastewater for agriculture therefore continued in Europe into the middle of the 19th century. Farmers, recognizing the value of excreta, were eager to get these fertilizers to increase production and urban sanitation benefited.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lüthi, C., Panesar, A., Schütze, T., Norström, A., McConville, J., Parkinson, J., Saywell, D., Ingle, R. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1019 Sustainable sanitation in cities: a framework for action]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA), International Forum on Urbanism (IFoU), Papiroz Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was also called [[gong farmer]] in England but carried many health risks for those involved with transporting the excreta and [[faecal sludge|fecal sludge]].

Traditional forms of sanitation and excreta reuse have continued in various parts of the world for centuries and were still common practice at the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Even as the world became increasingly more urbanised, the nutrients in excreta collected from urban sanitation systems without mixing with water were still used in many societies as a resource to maintain soil fertility, despite rising population densities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Decline in recovery of nutrients from human excreta in dry systems ===
Recovery of nutrients from excreta in non-sewered sanitation systems was addressing the sanitation problems in settlements in Europe and elsewhere and was contributing to securing agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the practice did not become the dominant approach to urban sanitation in the 20th century and was gradually replaced with sewer-based sanitation systems without nutrient recovery (apart from agricultural reuse of [[sewage sludge]] in some cases) – at least for cities that can afford it.

There were four main driving factors that led to the demise in the recovery and use of excreta and greywater from European cities in the 19th century:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Growth of urban settlements and increasing distance from agricultural fields.
* Increasing water consumption and use of flush toilet: Water flushing greatly increased the volume of sewage, at the same time diluting the nutrients, making it virtually impossible for them to be recovered and reused as they previously were.
* Production of cheap synthetic fertilizers, making any efforts to recover and reuse the nutrients and organic material from the large volumes of sewage obsolete.
*  Political intervention as a consequence of the perceived need for a change with regards to how to deal with odorous substances: Up until the end of the nineteenth century the dominant theory on the spread of illness was the [[miasma theory]]. This theory stated that everything that smelled had to be gotten rid of because inhaling bad smells was thought to lead to illness. 
The use of (odorous) animal [[manure]] in agriculture has continued through to this day, probably because the odour of manure was not thought to contribute to human illnesses.

The recovery of nutrients from wastewater still continues in two forms: 
* [[reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or [[resource recovery]]: Use of raw, treated or partially treated wastewater for irrigation in agriculture (with the associated health risks if it is done in an improper way which is often the case in developing countries); and 
* Application of [[sewage sludge]] to agricultural lands which is not without controversy in many industrialised countries due to the risks of polluting soils with heavy metals and micropollutants if not managed properly (see [[biosolids]]).

=== Research from 1990s onwards ===

The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida) funded the "SanRes R&amp;D programme" during 1993 to 2001 which lay the foundation for the subsequent "EcoSanRes programme" carried out by [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (2002–2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Eds.|last2 = Simpson-Hébert|first2 = co-authors: Uno Winblad, Mayling|title = Ecological sanitation|date = 2004|publisher = Stockholm Environment Institute|location = Stockholm|isbn = 978-9188714985|page = iii|edition = 2., rev. and enlarged|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarin, A. (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1968 EcoSanRes Programme - Phase Two 2006-2010]. Joint seminar of DWA and GTZ, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A publication by Sida called "Ecological sanitation" in 1998 compiled the knowledge generated to date about ecosan in a popular book which was published as a second edition in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Eds.|last2 = Simpson-Hébert|first2 = co-authors: Uno Winblad, Mayling|title = Ecological sanitation|date = 2004|publisher = Stockholm Environment Institute|location = Stockholm|isbn = 978-9188714985|page = 67|edition = 2., rev. and enlarged|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has also been translated into Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;Esrey, S., Gough, J., Rapaport, D., Sawyer, R., Simpson-Hébert, M., Vargas, J., Winblad, U. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/818 Ecological Sanitation (in Chinese)].

[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/868 Assainissement écologique (in French)] - Ecological sanitation.

[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/412 Saneamiento ecológico (in Spanish)] - Ecological Sanitation. SIDA, FES&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government enterprise [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] also had a large "ecosan program" from 2001 to 2012. Whilst the term "ecosan" was preferred in the initial stages of this program, it was from 2007 onwards more and more replaced by the broader term "[[sustainable sanitation]]". In fact, the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] was founded in 2007 in an attempt to broaden the ecosan concept and to bring together various actors under one umbrella.

Research into how to make reuse of urine and feces safe in agriculture was carried out by Swedish researchers, for example Hakan Jönsson and his team, whose publication on "Guidelines on the Use of Urine and feces in Crop Production"&lt;ref&gt;Joensson, H., Richert Stintzing, A., Vinneras, B., Salomon, E. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/187 Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production]. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; was a milestone which was later incorporated into the WHO "Guidelines on Safe Reuse of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater" from 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater] - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple barrier concept to reuse, which is the key cornerstone of this publication, has led to a clear understanding on how excreta reuse can be done safely.

=== Workshops and conferences ===
Initially, there were dedicated "ecosan conferences" to present and discuss research on ecosan projects: 
* A first workshop on ecological sanitation was held in Balingsholm, Sweden in 1997, where all the then established ecosan experts, such as Håkan Jönsson, Peter Morgan (winner of the 2013 [[Stockholm Water Prize]]),&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.siwi.org/prizes/stockholmwaterprize/laureates/2013-2/|title = Sanitation innovator named 2013 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate|date = 2013|accessdate = 13 July 2015|website = |publisher = Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Sawyer, George Anna Clark and Gunder Edström participated. 
* Workshop in Mexico in 1999 with the title "Closing the Loop - Ecological sanitation for food security"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Steven A. |last1=Esrey|title=Closing the loop ecological sanitation for food security|date=2001|publisher=SIDA|location=[Stockholm]|isbn=978-9158689350}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Ecosan conference in Bonn, Germany in 2000
* First international ecosan conference in Nanning, China in 2001
* Second ecosan conference in Lübeck Germany in 2003&lt;ref&gt;GTZ, IWA (2003). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2090 Ecosan - closing the loop - Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium], 7th –11th April 2003, Lübeck, Germany. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH and International Water Association (IWA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Third ecosan conference in Durban, South Africa in 2005
* Ecosan conference in Fortaleza, Brazil called "International Conference on Sustainable Sanitation - Water and Food Security for Latin America" in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/conference-materials-2/2007/117-conference-qwater-and-food-security-for-latin-americaq-brazil-2007|title = "Water and Food Security for Latin America", Fortaleza|date = 2007|accessdate = 13 July 2015|website = Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher = SuSanA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then the ecosan theme has been integrated into other [[WASH]] conferences, and separate large ecosan conferences have no longer been organised.

=== Disputes amongst experts ===

During the 1990s, when the term ecosan was something new, discussions were heated and confrontational.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Supporters of ecosan claimed the corner on containment, treatment and reuse. The proponents of conventional sanitation systems on the other side defended [[pit latrine]]s and waterborne [[Sewerage|sewage systems]]. Ecosan supporters criticised conventional sanitation for contaminating waterways with nutrients and pathogens.&amp;nbsp;Since about 2007, the two opposing sides have slowly found ways of dealing with each other, and the formation of the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] in that year has further helped to provide a space for all sanitation actors to meet and push into the same direction of sustainable sanitation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples ==
* Sweden is the leader in Europe to put ecosan into practice at a larger scale. For example, [[Tanum Municipality]] in Sweden has introduced urine separation toilets due to their very rocky and challenging terrain initially, and later also to recover phosphorus. 
* Sweden has also made it possible in 2013 to certify safe and sanitized blackwater (urine and human excreta) from blackwater systems and for further use as a recognized fertilizer. Such blackwater systems could be vacuum toilets or septic tanks. The criteria for the certification have been developed by the Swedish Institute for Agricultural and Environmental Engineering and may pave the way for farmers to use human waste for agricultural production. The Federation of Swedish Farmers have been active in this development. Furthermore, the Swedish EPA in their last proposal in 2014 has downgraded the hygiene risk associated with urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer6400/978-91-620-6580-5.pdf?pid=9620|title = Swedish EPA|date = |accessdate = 18 October 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the normal storage requirement for hygienic quality for large scale use of urine was 6 months. Now they propose decreasing this to one month.
* Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) ran a large worldwide ecosan research programme called "Ecosanres" from 2001 to 2011. One of the "dry ecosan" pilot projects (i.e. with using [[dry toilet]]s) of this programme was a large scale implementation of [[urine-diverting dry toilet|UDDTs]] in multi-story buildings together with other technologies to allow resource recovery from excreta.&lt;ref&gt;McConville, J., Rosemarin, A. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/case-studies/details/1049 Urine diversion dry toilets and greywater system, Erdos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt; This project was called the Erdos Eco-Town Project in a town called Erdos in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. It was a collaboration between the Dongsheng District government in Erdos and the Stockholm Environment Institute and aimed to save water and provide sanitation services in this drought-stricken and rapidly urbanizing area of northern China. For a variety of technical, social and institutional reasons, the UDDTs were removed after only a few years and the project failed to deliver in the area of nutrient recovery. This project is now well documented  and has raised more awareness of the challenges and disadvantages of "urban ecosan".&lt;ref&gt;Flores, A. (2010).

* [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] in [[Haiti]] built what they call "ecosan toilets" (UDDTs) as part of the emergency relief effort following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. More than 20,000 Haitians are currently using SOIL ecological sanitation toilets and SOIL has produced over 400,000 liters of [[compost]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;SOIL (2011).

They predominantly work in [[Tamil Nadu]] (India), where the Tamil Nadu State Government provides subsidies for their work. Wherever the Need have also constructed ecosan in other parts of rural [[India]], [[Kenya]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. According to their website, heir ecosan projects have positively affected 50,000 people in the developing world.
* The NGO CREPA which was operating in the French-speaking [[West Africa]] region (now called WSA – Water and Sanitation in Africa) was very active in ecosan promotion from 2002–2010 with a strong focus on UDDTs coupled with reuse in agriculture, especially in [[Burkina Faso]].

'''Econophysics''' is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by [[Physics|physicists]] in order to solve problems in [[economics]], usually those including uncertainty or [[stochastic process]]es and [[Chaos theory|nonlinear dynamics]]. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed [[statistical finance]] referring to its roots in [[statistical physics]].

==History==
Physicists' interest in the [[social sciences]] is not new; [[Daniel Bernoulli]], as an example, was the originator of [[utility]]-based preferences. One of the founders of [[neoclassical economic theory]], former Yale University Professor of Economics [[Irving Fisher]], was originally trained under the renowned Yale [[physicist]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaleeconomicreview.com/issues/2006_spring/financephysical.html Yale Economic Review, Retrieved October-25-09] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508025252/http://www.yaleeconomicreview.com/issues/2006_spring/financephysical.html |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jan Tinbergen]], who won the first [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1969 for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes, studied physics with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] at [[Leiden University]]. In particular, Tinbergen developed the [[Gravity model of trade|gravity model of international trade]] that has become the workhorse of international economics.

Econophysics was started in the mid-1990s by several physicists working in the subfield of [[statistical mechanics]].  Unsatisfied with the traditional explanations and approaches of economists – which usually prioritized simplified approaches for the sake of soluble theoretical models over agreement with empirical data – they applied tools and methods from physics, first to try to match financial data sets, and then to explain more general economic phenomena.

One driving force behind econophysics arising at this time was the sudden availability of large amounts of financial data, starting in the 1980s.  It became apparent that traditional methods of analysis were insufficient – standard economic methods dealt with homogeneous agents and equilibrium, while many of the more interesting phenomena in financial markets fundamentally depended on [[Heterogeneous agents#Social and human science|heterogeneous agents]] and far-from-equilibrium situations.

The term "econophysics" was coined by [[H. Eugene Stanley]], to describe the large number of papers written by physicists in the problems of (stock and other) markets, in a conference on statistical physics in [[Kolkata]] (erstwhile [[Calcutta]])  in 1995 and first appeared in its proceedings publication in [[Physica A]] 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saha.ac.in/cmp/camcs/Stanley-interview.pdf  Interview of H. E. Stanley on Econophysics (Published in "IIM Kozhikode Society &amp; Management Review", Sage publication (USA), Vol. 2 Issue 2 (July), pp. 73-78 (2013))]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.2191.pdf Econophysics Research in India in the last two Decades (1993-2013) (Published in "IIM Kozhikode Society &amp; Management Review", Sage publication (USA), Vol. 2 Issue 2 (July), pp. 135-146 (2013))]&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural meeting on econophysics was organised in 1998 in Budapest by [[János Kertész]] and [[Imre Kondor]].

The almost regular meeting series on the topic include: APFA, ECONOPHYS-KOLKATA,&lt;ref&gt;''Econophysics of Wealth Distributions'', Eds. A. Chatterjee, S. Yarlagadda, B.K. Chakrabarti, New Economic Windows, Springer-Verlag, Milan, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Econophysics Colloquium, ESHIA/ WEHIA.

In recent years [[network science]], heavily reliant on analogies from [[statistical mechanics]], has been applied to the study of productive systems. That is the case with the works done at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in European Funded Research Projects as Forecasting Financial Crises and the Harvard-MIT [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity|Observatory of Economic Complexity]]

If "econophysics" is taken to denote the principle of applying statistical mechanics to economic analysis, as opposed to a particular literature or network, priority of innovation is probably due to Emmanuel Farjoun and [[Moshé Machover]] (1983). Their book ''Laws of Chaos: A Probabilistic Approach to Political Economy'' proposes ''dis''solving (their words) the [[transformation problem]] in Marx's political economy by re-conceptualising the relevant quantities as random variables.&lt;ref&gt;Farjoun and Machover disclaim complete originality: their book is dedicated to the late  Robert H. Langston, who they cite for direct inspiration (page 12), and they also note an independent suggestion in a discussion paper by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E.T. Jaynes]] (page 239)&lt;/ref&gt;

If, on the other hand, "econophysics" is taken to denote the application of physics to
economics, one can consider the works of [[Léon Walras]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]] as part of it. Indeed, as shown by [[Bruna Ingrao]] and [[Giorgio Israel]], [[general equilibrium theory]] in economics is based on the physical concept of [[mechanical equilibrium]].

Econophysics has nothing to do with the "physical quantities approach" to economics, advocated by [[Ian Steedman]] and others associated with [[neo-Ricardianism]]. Notable econophysicists are [[Jean-Philippe Bouchaud]], [[Bikas K Chakrabarti]], [[J. Doyne Farmer]], [[Dirk Helbing]], [[János Kertész]], [[Francis Longstaff]], [[Rosario N. Mantegna]], Matteo Marsili, [[Joseph L. McCauley]], Enrico Scalas, [[Didier Sornette]], [[H. Eugene Stanley]], [[Victor Yakovenko]] and Yi-Cheng Zhang.  Particularly noteworthy among the formal courses on econophysics is the one offered by the Physics Department of the [[Leiden University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/courses/show/34804/econofysica|title=Econophysics, 2012-2013 ~ e-Prospectus, Leiden University|website=studiegids.leidenuniv.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/courses/show/41126/econofysica|title=Econophysics, 2014-2015 ~ e-Prospectus, Leiden University|website=studiegids.leidenuniv.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;from where the first Nobel-laureate in economics [[Jan Tinbergen]] came. From September 2014 King's College has awarded the first position of Full Professor in Econophysics.

==Basic tools==

Basic tools of econophysics are [[Probability|probabilistic]] and [[Statistics|statistical]] methods often taken from statistical physics.

Physics models that have been applied in economics include the [[kinetic theory of gas]] (called the [[kinetic exchange models of markets]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Bikas K Chakrabarti]], Anirban Chakraborti, Satya R Chakravarty, Arnab Chatterjee |title=Econophysics of Income &amp; Wealth Distributions | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]]|year= 2012 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[percolation]] models, [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] models developed to study cardiac arrest, and models with [[self-organizing criticality]] as well as other models developed for [[earthquake prediction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Didier Sornette]] |title=Why Stock Markets Crash? |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year= 2003 |accessdate=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there have been attempts to use the mathematical theory of [[complexity]] and [[information theory]], as developed by many scientists among whom are [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Claude E. Shannon]], respectively.

For [[Potential game#Bounded Rational Models|potential games]], it has been shown that an emergence-producing equilibrium based on information via Shannon information entropy produces the same equilibrium measure ([[Gibbs measure]] from statistical mechanics) as a stochastic dynamical equation, both of which are based on [[bounded rationality]] models used by economists.  The fluctuation-dissipation theorem connects the two to establish a concrete correspondence of "temperature", "entropy", "free potential/energy", and other physics notions to an economics system.  The statistical mechanics model is not constructed a-priori - it is a result of a bounded rational assumption and modeling on existing neoclassical models.  It has been used to prove the "inevitability of collusion" result of [[Huw Dixon]] in a case for which the neoclassical version of the model does not predict collusion.&lt;ref name="HD"&gt;

Here the demand is increasing, as with [[Veblen good]]s or stock buyers with the [[Hot-hand fallacy#Consumers|"hot hand"]] fallacy preferring to buy more successful stocks and sell those that are less successful.

&lt;/ref&gt;


Quantifiers derived from [[information theory]] were used in several papers by econophysicist [http://www.aureliofernandez.net/ Aurelio F. Bariviera] and coauthors in order to assess the degree in the informational efficiency of stock markets. In a paper published in Physica A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zunino, L., Bariviera, A.F., Guercio, M.B., Martinez, L.B. and Rosso, O.A.|title=On the efficiency of sovereign bond markets |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume= 391|pages= 4342–4349|year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2012.04.009 | issue = 18|bibcode = 2012PhyA..391.4342Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zunino et al. use an innovative statistical tool in the financial literature: the complexity-entropy causality plane. This Cartesian representation establish an efficiency ranking of different markets and distinguish different bond market dynamics. Moreover, the authors conclude that the classification derived from the complexity-entropy causality plane is consistent with the qualifications assigned by major rating companies to the sovereign instruments. A similar study developed by Bariviera et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bariviera, A.F., Zunino, L., Guercio, M.B., Martinez, L.B. and Rosso, O.A.|title=Efficiency and credit ratings: a permutation-information-theory analysis |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment|volume= 2013|page= P08007|year=2013 |doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2013/08/P08007 | issue = 8|bibcode = 2013JSMTE..08..007F |arxiv = 1509.01839 |url=http://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/11336/2007/1/Journal_of_Statistical_Mechanics.pdf|hdl=11336/2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; explore the relationship between credit ratings and informational efficiency of a sample of corporate bonds of US oil and energy companies using also the complexity–entropy causality plane. They find that this classification agrees with the credit ratings assigned by Moody's.

Another good example is [[random matrix theory]], which can be used to identify the noise in financial correlation matrices.  One paper has argued that this technique can improve the performance of portfolios, e.g., in applied in [[Modern portfolio theory|portfolio optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vasiliki Plerou |author2=Parameswaran Gopikrishnan |author3=Bernd Rosenow |author4=Luis Amaral |author5=Thomas Guhr |author6=H.

There are, however, various other tools from physics that have so far been used, such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[classical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] (including so-called [[classical economy]], [[quantum economy]] and [[quantum finance]]),&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Probabilstic Economic Theory|last = Anatoly V. Kondratenko|first =|publisher = LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing |year = 2015|isbn = 978-3-659-89232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[path integral formulation]] of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[economic complexity index]], introduced by the MIT physicist [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and the Harvard economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]] and made available at MIT's [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity|Observatory of Economic Complexity]], has been devised as a [[List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates|predictive tool for economic growth]]. According to the estimates of Hausmann and Hidalgo, the ECI is far more accurate in predicting GDP growth than the traditional governance measures of the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/atlas/ |title= The Atlas of Economic Complexity |author1=Ricardo Hausmann |author2=Cesar Hidalgo |publisher= The Observatory of Economic Complexity (MIT Media Lab) |accessdate=26 April 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also analogies between finance theory and [[diffusion]] theory. For instance, the [[Black–Scholes equation]] for [[option (finance)|option]] pricing is a [[diffusion equation|diffusion]]-[[advection]] equation (see however &lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jean-Philippe Bouchaud |author2=Marc Potters |title=Theory of Financial Risk and Derivative Pricing |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2003 |accessdate=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/713665871 | volume=1 | issue=5 | title=Welcome to a non-Black-Scholes world | year=2001 | journal=Quantitative Finance | pages=482–483 | last1 = Bouchaud | first1 = J-P. | last2 = Potters | first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a critique of the Black-Scholes methodology). The Black-Scholes theory can be extended to provide an analytical theory of main factors in economic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influence==

Papers on econophysics have been published primarily in journals devoted to physics and statistical mechanics, rather than in leading economics journals. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream economists]] have generally been unimpressed by this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Philip Ball |title=Econophysics: Culture Crash |journal=Nature |volume=441 |pages=686–688 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/441686a |pmid=16760949 |issue=7094|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..686B |citeseerx=10.1.1.188.8120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists, including [[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Paul Ormerod]], and Alan Kirman have shown more interest, but also criticized some trends in econophysics.

In contrast, econophysics is having some impact on the more applied field of [[quantitative finance]], whose scope and aims significantly differ from those of economic theory. Various econophysicists have introduced models for price fluctuations in [[financial markets]] or original points of view on established models.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enrico Scalas |title=The application of continuous-time random walks in finance and economics |journal=Physica A |volume=362 |pages=225–239 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2005.11.024|bibcode = 2006PhyA..362..225S |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Y.

==Main results==
Presently, one of the main results of econophysics comprises the explanation of the [[Fat-tailed distribution|"fat tails"]] in the distribution of many kinds of financial data as a [[Universality class|universal]] self-similar [[scaling invariance|scaling]] property (i.e. scale invariant over many orders of magnitude in the data),&lt;ref&gt;The physicists noted the scaling behaviour of "fat tails" through a letter to the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Rosario N. Mantegna and H. Eugene Stanley: ''Scaling behavior in the dynamics of an economic index'', Nature Vol. 376, pages 46-49 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; arising from the tendency of individual market competitors, or of aggregates of them, to exploit systematically and optimally the prevailing "microtrends" (e.g., rising or falling prices). These "fat tails" are not only mathematically important, because they comprise the  [[risk]]s, which may be on the one hand, very small such that one may tend to  neglect them, but which - on the other hand - are not neglegible at all, i.e. they can never be made exponentially tiny, but instead follow a measurable algebraically decreasing  power law, for example with a ''failure probability'' of only &lt;math&gt;P\propto x^{-4}\,,&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is an increasingly large variable  in the tail region of the distribution considered (i.e. a price statistics with much more than 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; data). I.e., the events considered are not simply "outliers" but must really be taken into account and cannot be "insured away".&lt;ref name="Preis" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; It appears that it also plays a role that near a change of the tendency (e.g. from falling to rising prices) there are typical "panic reactions" of the selling or buying agents with algebraically increasing bargain rapidities and  volumes.&lt;ref name="Preis"&gt;See for example Preis, Mantegna, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; The "fat tails" are also observed in [[commodity market]]s.

As in quantum field theory the "fat tails" can be obtained by complicated "[[nonperturbative]]" methods, mainly by numerical ones, since they contain the deviations from the usual [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian approximations]], e.g. the [[Black-Scholes]] theory.  Fat tails can, however, also be due to other phenomena, such as a random number of terms in the central-limit theorem, or any number of other, non-econophysics models.   Due to the difficulty in testing such models, they have received less attention in traditional economic analysis.

'''Ectogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ecto'', "outer," and ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'') is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ectogenesis yourdictionary.com &gt; ectogenesis] In turn citing: Webster's New World College Dictionary, 2010 by Wiley Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] outside the mother's body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Ectogenesis ectogenesis]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by British scientist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artificial Wombs Are Coming, but the Controversy Is Already Here |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/artificial-wombs-are-coming-and-the-controversys-already-here |work=Motherboard |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=16 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ECTOGENESIS: A REPLY TO SINGER AND WELLS|first=DAVID N.|last=JAMES|date=1 January 1987|journal=Bioethics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=80–99|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.1987.tb00006.x|pmid = 11649763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human embryos and fetuses==
{{Further|Artificial uterus}}
Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an [[artificial uterus]]. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the [[placenta]]. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human [[reproductive rights]].

Ectogenesis could also be a means by which [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and single men could have genetic offspring without the use of [[surrogate pregnancy]] or a [[sperm donor]], and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle.

==Bioethical considerations==
The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few [[bioethics|bioethical]] and legal considerations, and also has important implications for [[reproductive rights]] and the [[abortion debate]].

Artificial uteri may expand the range of [[fetal viability]], raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within [[abortion law]]. Within severance theory, for example, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. If transferring the fetus from a woman's womb to an artificial uterus is possible, the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could provide an alternative to aborting the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Vernellia|author2=Randall, Tshaka C.|title=Built in Obsolescence: The Coming End to the Abortion Debate|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=22 March 2008|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1112367|url=https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=vernellia_randall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chessen|first1=Matt|title=Artificial Wombs Could Outlaw Abortion|url=http://www.mattlesnake.com/2013/03/02/artificial-wombs-could-outlaw-abortion/|website=Mattlesnake.com|date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack "some essential bond with their mothers that other children have";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smajdor|first=Anna|title=The Moral Imperative for Ectogenesis|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|date=Summer 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–45|pmid=17695628|url=http://annasmajdor.me.uk/ectogenesis_final.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0963180107070405}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secondary issue to woman's rights over their own body.

In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].
*[[Chuck E. Cheese's]] (U.S.-owned)
*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;&lt;!--Sources some but not all of this list, especially many of the dates and places. IT MUST BE CITED WHERE IT *DOES* SOURCE THE MATERIAL, not just at the top of the list! --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6475">'''Feedforward, Behavior and Cognitive Science''' is a method of [[teaching]] and learning that illustrates or indicates a desired future behavior or path to a goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creating-futures.org/keystosuccess/feedforward/&lt;/ref&gt; Feedforward provides information, images, etc. exclusively about what one could do right in the future, often in contrast to what one has done in the past. The feedforward method of teaching and learning is in contrast to its opposite, [[feedback]], concerning [[human behavior]] because it focuses on learning in the future, whereas feedback uses information from a past event to provide reflection and the basis for behaving and thinking differently. In isolation, feedback is the least effective form of instruction, according to [[US Department of Defense]] studies in the 1980s. Feedforward was coined in 1976 by Peter W. Dowrick in his dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1976). Self modelling: A videotape training technique for disturbed and disabled children. Doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedforward in behavioral and [[cognitive science]] may be defined as "images of adaptive future behavior, hitherto not mastered"; images capable of triggering that behavior in a challenging context.  Feedforward is created by restructuring current component behaviors into what appears to be a new skill or level of performance.

One concept of feedforward originated in [[behavioral science]]. Related concepts have emerged  in [[biology]], [[cybernetics]], and [[management science]]s. The understanding of feedforward help the understanding of [[brain function]] and [[rapid learning]]. The concept contributed to research and development of [[video self modeling]] (VSM).  The most productive advances in feedforward came from its association with videos that showed [[adaptive behavior]] (see Dowrick, 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;111, 121; 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;110–3, 120-2, 240-1; 1999, esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26).&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1983).  Self-modelling.  In P. W. Dowrick &amp; S. J. Biggs (Eds.),  Using video:  Psychological and social applications (pp.&amp;nbsp;105–124).  Chichester, UK: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1999).  A review of self modeling and related interventions.  Applied and Preventive Psychology, 8, 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a boy with [[autism]] role-plays squeezing a ball ([[stress management]] technique) instead of having a [[tantrum]] when his work is found imperfect by the teacher – or a [[selectively mute]] child is seen on video talking at school, by editing in footage of her talking at home (location disguised by use of a classroom backdrop). By selectively editing a video, a clip was made that demonstrated the desired behavior and allowed the children to learn from their future successes.

By reference to its historical context of [[Video self-modeling|VSM]], it became recognized that feedforward comprised component behaviors already in the [[repertoire]], and that it could exist in forms other than videos. In fact, feedforward exists as images in the brain, and VSM is just one of many ways to create these simulations. The videos are very short – the best are 1 or 2 minutes long, and achieve changes in behavior very rapidly. Under the right conditions, a very few viewings of these videos can produce [[skill acquisition]]s or changes in performance that typically take months and have been resistant to change by other methods. The boy with autism and the girl with selective mutism, mentioned above, are good examples.  Further examples can be found in journal articles,&lt;ref&gt;Bellini, S., Akullian, J., &amp; Hopf, A. (2007).  Increasing social engagement in young children with autism spectrum disorders using video self modeling.  School Psychology Review, 36, 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buggey, T. (2005).  Video self modeling applications with students with autism spectrum disorder in a small private school setting.  Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 20, 52-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W., Kim-Rupnow, W. S., &amp; Power, T. J. (2006). Video feedforward for reading.  Journal of Special Education, 39, 194-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the web (e.g., in sport&lt;ref&gt;http://keithlyons.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/feedforward/&lt;/ref&gt;).

The evidence for ultra-rapid learning, built from component behaviors that are reconfigured to appear as new skills, indicates the feedforward self model mechanism existing in the brain to control our future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (2011).  Self model theory: Learning from the future.  Article invited, WIREs for Cognitive Science.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, if the conditions of learning are right, the brain takes pieces of existing skills, puts them together in new ways or in a different context, to produce a future image and a future response. Thus we learn from the future – more rapidly than we learn from the past. Further evidence comes from [[cognitive process]]es dubbed "mental time travel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Suddendorf, T., &amp; [[Michael Corballis|Corballis]], M. C.|year=2007|title=The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=30|pages=299–313|pmid=17963565|doi=10.1017/s0140525x07001975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for parts of the [[hippocampus]] etc. where they occur.&lt;ref&gt;Addis, D.

Neuropsychologica, 45, 1363-1377.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the links between these hot spots in the brain and feedforward learning have yet to be confirmed.

Feedforward concepts have become established in at least four areas of science, and they continue to spread. Feedforward often works in concert with [[feedback loop]]s for [[guidance system]]s in cybernetics or [[self-control]] in biology {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

Feedforward in management theory enables the prediction and control of [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basso, D. |author2= Belardinelli, M.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Podofilija.jpg|thumb|Toe sucking and foot licking is a common way of expressing foot fetishism.]]
Foot fetishism has been defined as a pronounced sexual interest in feet. For a foot fetishist, points of attraction may include the shape and size of feet and toes (e.g. long toes, short toes, painted toenails, high arches, soles etc.), jewelry (e.g. [[toe ring]]s, [[ankle bracelet|anklets]], etc.), treatments (such as massaging, washing partner's feet or painting partner's toenails), state of dress ([[barefoot]], [[flip flops]], [[sandals]], [[high heels]], [[hosiery]], socked feet, etc.), [[foot odor]] and/or sensory interaction (e.g. rubbing the foot, tickling, smelling, kissing, biting, licking, sucking toes, [[Footjob|rubbing genitals on foot]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kippen |first1=Cameron |title=The History of Footwear – Foot Fetish and Shoe Retifism |url=http://podiatry.curtin.edu.au/fetish.html |accessdate=10 December 2014 |via=National Library of Australia |publisher=Department of Podiatry, Curtin University |date=July 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018035445/http://podiatry.curtin.edu.au/fetish.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensions of this fetish include [[shoe fetishism|shoes]], [[socks]] and [[tickling fetish|tickling]]. [[Sigmund Freud]] considered [[foot binding]] as a form of fetishism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacker|first1=Authur|title=China Illustrated|date=2012|publisher=Turtle Publishing|isbn=9781462906901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5JyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative frequency==
To estimate the relative frequency of fetishes, in 2006 researchers at the [[University of Bologna]] examined 381 internet discussions of fetish groups, in which at least 5,000 people had been participating. Researchers estimated the prevalences of different fetishes based on the following elements:
* (a) the number of discussion groups devoted to a particular fetish;
* (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups;
* (c) the number of messages exchanged.

It was concluded that the most common fetishes were for body parts or for objects usually associated with body parts (33% and 30% respectively). Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them. Among those people preferring objects related to body parts, 32% were in groups related to footwear (shoes, boots, etc.).&lt;ref name="scorolli" /&gt;

Foot fetishism is the most common form of sexual fetish related to the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish not Necessarily Unhealthy – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, [[AOL]] released a database of the search terms submitted by their subscribers. In ranking only those phrases that included the word "fetish", it was found that the most common search was for feet.&lt;ref&gt;''AOL's Accidental Release of Search Data – The Sexmind of America.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070221135508/http://www.aphrodisiology.com/aol-fetishes aphrodisiology.com], accessed June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example cases==
===Health and disease===
The first surviving mention of foot fetish is by [[Bertold of Regensburg]] in 1220.&lt;ref&gt;Coulton, G. G. (1923) ''Life in the Middle Ages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have hypothesized that foot fetishism increases as a response to epidemics of [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. In one study, conducted by Dr. A James Giannini at [[Ohio State University]], an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great [[gonorrhea]] epidemic of twelfth-century Europe, and the [[syphilis]] epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini et al., op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in [[pornographic literature]] was measured over a 30-year interval. An exponential increase was noted during the period of the current [[AIDS epidemic]]. In these cases, sexual footplay was viewed as a [[safe sex]] alternative. However, the researchers noted that these epidemics overlapped periods of relative female emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Giannini|first1=AJ|last2=Colapietro|first2=G|last3=Slaby|first3=AE|last4=Melemis|first4=SM|last5=Bowman|first5=RK|title= Sexualization of the female foot as a response to sexually transmitted epidemics: a preliminary study|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=83|issue=2|pages=491–8|year=1998|pmid=9819924|doi=10.2466/pr0.83.6.491-498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual focus on female feet was also hypothesized to have been a reflection of a more dominant posture of the woman in sexual-social relations.

===Causes===
{{See also|Sexual fetishism}}
Foot fetishism is caused by the feet and the genitals occupying adjacent areas of the [[Postcentral gyrus|somatosensory cortex]], possibly entailing some neural crosstalk between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Kringelbach, Morten. ''Bodily Illusions''. [http://www.kringelbach.dk/Preprint_Beagle_BodilyIllusions.html kringelbach.dk] last accessed Sept 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has noted amputees reporting orgasms in their feet.&lt;ref name="Ramachandran"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Blakeslee|first=Sandra|title=[[Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind]]|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|year=1999|isbn=9780688172176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]] considered foot fetishism the result of [[Imprinting (psychology)|mal-imprinting]] at an early age, the tactile pressure of a foot/shoe being important in this.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (1994) p. 279-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's reading of foot-fetishism also involved early imprinting; but he considered the smell of feet significant in this, as well as the foot as penis-symbol/surrogate ([[castration complex]], especially when encountered while voyeuristic exploring the female body from below).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 68n&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Otto Fenichel]] similarly saw castration fear as significant in foot fetishism, citing a future fetishist who as an adolescent said to himself "You must remember this throughout life – that girls, too, have legs", to protect himself from the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Where fear of the (castrated) female body is too great, desire is felt not for shoes on female feet but for women's shoes alone, without women.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fortsas hoax''' refers to an incident in [[Binche|Binche, Belgium]], in 1840.  That year, booksellers, librarians, and collectors of rare books throughout [[Europe]] received a catalogue describing a collection of rare books to be auctioned.

According to the message, "Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas", had been a collector of unique books — books of which only one copy was known to exist.  When he had died, on September 1, 1839, he had possessed 52 such books.  His heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection.  The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840.

On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books.  They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist — nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located.  Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library.  Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas.

It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer [[Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon]], who enjoyed playing elaborate [[prank]]s on intellectuals.

Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to his victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item.  It has since been reprinted several times.

In mathematics, a '''fractal''' is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly exceeds its [[topological dimension]]. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their tendency to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek"/&gt; Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales,&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''expanding symmetry''' or '''unfolding symmetry'''; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the [[Menger sponge]],&lt;ref name="Gouyet" /&gt; it is called a [[self-similar]] pattern.

One way that fractals are different from finite [[geometric figures]] is the way in which they [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. Doubling the edge lengths of a [[polygon]] multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its [[volume]] scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an [[integer]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |title=The fractal geometry of nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's [[topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mandelbrot | first=Benoît B. | title=Fractals and Chaos| publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | year=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20158-0 | quote=A fractal set is one for which the fractal (Hausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mathematical equations, fractals are usually nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line - although it is still [[topological dimension|1-dimensional]] its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;

The mathematical [[#history|roots]] of fractals have been traced throughout the years as a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of [[recursion]], then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=S. L.|title=Riemann's example of a continuous 'nondifferentiable' function continued|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|date=June 1978|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–82|doi=10.1007/BF03023065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on to the coining of the word ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin ''[[wikt:fractus#Latin|frāctus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional [[fractal dimension|dimensions]] to geometric [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical people : profiles and interviews|last1=Albers|first1=Donald J.|last2=Alexanderson|first2=Gerald L.|publisher=AK Peters|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-340-0|location=Wellesley, MA|page=214|chapter=Benoît Mandelbrot: In his own words|author2-link=Gerald L.

There is some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoit|title=24/7 Lecture on Fractals|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7HB5Oze4g#t=70|work=2006 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Improbable Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension]] strictly exceeds the [[topological dimension]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, B.B.: The Fractal Geometry of Nature. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1982); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Feder|title=Fractals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgvyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-2124-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use ''fractal'' without a pedantic definition, to use ''[[fractal dimension]]'' as a generic term applicable to ''all'' the variants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Edgar|title=Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk2vruTv0_gC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-74749-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Simple Fractals.png|thumb|right| A simple fractal tree created through javascript]]
The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laymen as opposed to mathematicians, where the layman is more likely to be familiar with [[fractal art]] than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|166; 18}}&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt;

This idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].

This also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are "nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] pondered [[recursion|recursive]] [[self-similarity]] (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the [[straight line]] was self-similar in this sense).&lt;ref name="Pickover"&gt;{{cite book |page=310 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=fractal+koch+curve+book#v=onepage&amp;q=fractal%20koch%20curve%20book&amp;f=false |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover

One of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch snowflake]].&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. By 1918, two French mathematicians, [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]], though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping [[complex numbers]] and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about [[strange attractors|attractors and repellors]] (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, [[Felix Hausdorff]] expanded the definition of "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]].&lt;ref group="notes" name="levy note" /&gt;

Different researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon

In 1975&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt; Mandelbrot solidified hundreds of years of thought and mathematical development in coining the word "fractal" and illustrated his mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images, such as of his canonical [[Mandelbrot set]], captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term "fractal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qDQjyuuDRxUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |page=1 |title=Fractal surfaces |volume= 1 |first=John C. |last=Russ |accessdate=2011-02-05 |year=1994 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-306-44702-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickover" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
One often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is "a rough or fragmented [[Shape|geometric shape]] that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole";&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of ''fractal'', but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and an unusual relationship with the space a fractal is embedded in.&lt;ref name="Gouyet"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gouyet | first=Jean-François | title=Physics and fractal structures | publisher=Masson Springer | location=Paris/New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-387-94153-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Falconer | first=Kenneth | title=Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2003 | pages=xxv | isbn= 978-0-470-84862-3 | nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Edgar | first=Gerald | title=Measure, topology, and fractal geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-74748-4 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s, but whereas these numbers quantify [[complexity]] (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karperien |first=Audrey |title=Defining microglial morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension |publisher=Charles Sturt University |year= 2004 |doi=10.13140/2.1.2815.9048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal", he did so to denote an object whose [[Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension]] is greater than its [[Lebesgue covering dimension|topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt; It has been noted that this dimensional requirement is not met by fractal [[space-filling curve]]s such as the [[Hilbert curve]].&lt;ref group=notes name="space filling note" /&gt;

According to Falconer, rather than being strictly defined, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a [[fractal dimension]], be generally characterized by a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] of the following features;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;

* Self-similarity, which may be manifested as:
:* Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales; e.g. [[#koch|Koch snowflake]]
:* Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the [[Mandelbrot set]]'s satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
:* Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern [[stochastic]]ally so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., [[#random|randomly generated fractals]]; the well-known example of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]], for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines, for example, the Koch snowflake&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;
:* Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series&lt;ref name="time series"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peters | first=Edgar | title=Chaos and order in the capital markets : a new view of cycles, prices, and market volatility | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-471-13938-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Multifractal]] scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule
* Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have [[emergent properties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John |last1=Spencer |first2=Michael S. C. |last2=Thomas |first3=James L. |last3=McClelland |title=Toward a unified theory of development : connectionism and dynamic systems theory re-considered |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford/New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-530059-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (related to the next criterion in this list).
* Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as "smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls".&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;
* Simple and "perhaps [[recursion|recursive]]" definitions ''see [[#algorithms|Common techniques for generating fractals]]''

As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]], and is fully defined without a need for recursion.&lt;ref name ="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;

* ''[[L-system]]s'' – use string rewriting; may resemble branching patterns, such as in plants, biological cells (e.g., neurons and immune system cells&lt;ref name="branching" /&gt;), blood vessels, pulmonary structure,&lt;ref name="modeling vasculature" /&gt; etc. or [[turtle graphics]] patterns such as [[space-filling curves]] and tilings

[[File:Apophysis-100303-104.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fractal flame]]]]
Fractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being "fractals" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

Modeled fractals may be sounds,&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; digital images, electrochemical patterns, [[circadian rhythm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fathallah-Shaykh | first1=Hassan M. | title=Fractal Dimension of the Drosophila Circadian Clock | doi=10.1142/S0218348X11005476 | journal=Fractals | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=423–430 | year=2011 | pmid= | pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
Fractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space&lt;ref name="medicine" /&gt;{{rp|10}} and virtually, often called "[[in silico]]" modeling.&lt;ref name="modeling vasculature" /&gt; Models of fractals are generally created using [[fractal-generating software]] that implements techniques such as those outlined above.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time series" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicine" /&gt; As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system,&lt;ref name="branching" /&gt; blood and lung vasculature,&lt;ref name="modeling vasculature"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fractal aspects of three-dimensional vascular constructive optimization

Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.

If a circle boundary is drawn around the two-dimensional view of a fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, this is due to the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Fractals-Useful-Beauty.htm|title=Introduction to Fractal Geometry|website=www.fractal.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of [[ion propulsion]], when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html|title=NASA – Ion Propulsion|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=August 18, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Germ-band extension.png|thumb|550px|alt=germ-band extension.|Schematic of ''Drosophila'' embryo at the start of germ-band elongation and 30 minutes later.  The germ-band (grey) is posterior to the cephalic furrow (curved-line) and folds dorsally (red arrow) upon cell intercalation.  Each rectangle represents a field of cells before (0 min) and after (30 min) convergent extension.  Colored nuclei arbitrarily mark rows of cells in order to visualize tissue morphogenesis.]]

'''Germ-band extension''' is a [[morphogenesis|morphological]] process widely studied in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' in which the [[germ layer|germ-band]], which develops into the segmented trunk of the embryo, approximately doubles in length along the [[anterior|anterior-posterior]] axis while subsequently narrowing along the dorsal-ventral axis.&lt;ref name="wie94"&gt;Irvine, K., and Wieschaus, E. (1994). Cell intercalation during Drosophila germ-band extension and its regulation by pair-rule segmentation genes. Development 120, 827–841.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germ-band extension begins shortly after [[gastrulation]] and is divided into two phases.  The fast phase, in which most of the extension occurs, takes about 25 minutes. The remaining extension continues during the slow phase and is completed in the following 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, S. M. &amp; Vincent, J. P. (2007). Oriented cell divisions in the extending germband of Drosophila. Development 134, 3049–3054.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this process the ventral germ-band extends around the posterior end of the embryo, effectively folding over onto the dorsal side of the egg. Multiple individual cells intercalating mediolateral to the anterior-posterior axis drive the resulting global elongation of the embryo. In addition, cell shape changes, and oriented cell divisions in the posterior germ-band are in part required for full elongation.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"&gt;Butler, L.C., et al. (2009). Cell shape changes indicate a role for extrinsic tensile forces in Drosophila germ-band extension. Nature Cell Biology 11, 859-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, elongation of the body axis seems to be primarily linked to changes in cell neighbor relations.

This article describes axis elongation in ''Drosophila''.   However, the basis of germ-band elongation is applicable to many organisms including other [[invertebrates]] and [[vertebrates]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, R. (2006). Mechanisms of elongation in embryogenesis. Development 133, 2291–2302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==
[[Image:T1Junction.png|thumb|550px|alt=T1 Junction Exchange.|Schematic of neighbor exchange or an elementary T1 process involving four cells.  T1-magenta cells are in direct contact.  T2-all cells share a common vertex. T3-resolution results in green cells sharing a common boundary.]]

In order for cells to intercalate between one another the [[adherens junctions]] that maintain the integrity of the [[epithelial]] tissue must be dynamically remodeled. [[Time-lapse microscopy]] has captured this process of cell neighbor exchange, which is schematically represented to the right. In the type 1 configuration, two cells contact each other along the anterior-posterior axis, whereas two dorsal-ventral cells do not directly contact. Next, the cell boundary between the two anterior-posterior neighbors selectively shrinks, resulting in an obligatory intermediate type 2 junction, where the four cells share a vertex. Upon resolution of the type 2 junction, a new type 3 junctions forms perpendicular to the original type 1 configuration. During this process the two dorsal-ventral cells have become neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Bertet, C., Sulak, L. &amp; Lecuit, T. (2004). Myosin-dependent junction remodelling controls planar cell intercalation and axis elongation. Nature 429, 667–671.&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple clusters of cells intercalate in the dorsal-ventral axis, through junctional neighbor exchange, the outcome is an extension of germ-band in the anterior-posterior axis.

In addition to the simple neighbor exchange, higher-ordered rosette formations have been observed in which five or more cells meet at a vertex. Multicellular rosettes form and resolve in a directional fashion that promotes germ-band elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Blankenship, J. T., Backovic, S. T., Sanny, J. S., Weitz, O. and Zallen, J. A. (2006). Multicellular rosette formation links planar cell polarity to tissue morphogenesis. Dev. Cell 11, 459-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbor exchange and multicellular rosette formation involve oriented junctional remodeling, which indicates that the intercalating cells are intrinsically polarized within the plane of the epithelium.

==Molecular basis==
[[Image:planarpolarity.png|thumb|450px|alt=Planar Polarity.|Asymmetric localization of proteins to reciprocal cell borders in the apical plane of a polarized epithelial.]]

The dorsal-ventral intercalation of cells during germ-band extension ultimately arises from the asymmetric localization of proteins within individual cells. [[Immunofluorescence]] reveals that non-muscle [[Myosin II]] localizes to the anterior-posterior boundaries of cells, destabilizing adherens junctions, whereas the Bazooka/Par-3 complex localizes to dorsal-ventral boundaries, stabilizing adherens junctions. Moreover, ''bazooka'' mutants are defective in germ-band extension, which supports the idea that polarized protein localization is critical for cell rearrangements.&lt;ref name="wie04"&gt;Zallen, J., and Wieschaus, E. (2004). Patterned gene expression directs bipolar planar polarity in Drosophila. Dev. Cell 6, 343–355.&lt;/ref&gt; One mechanism by which Myosin II might promote polarized cell remodeling is through contractile activity that creates tension orienting junctional disassembly.&lt;ref&gt;Baum  B. (2004). Animal development: crowd control. Curr Biol. 7;14, 716-718.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precise mechanism in which asymmetrically localized protein complexes encourage directed intercalation remains disputed.

The source that establishes planar polarity during germ-band extension remains elusive. Polarized intercalation is largely unaffected in mutant embryos that lack dorsal-ventral cell types. Yet, mutations that disrupt segmental patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, such as ''[[pair-rule gene|eve]]'' and ''[[pair-rule gene|runt]]'', decrease cell intercalation and subsequent germ-band elongation.&lt;ref name="wie94"/&gt; Furthermore, [[ectopic expression]] of eve or runt is sufficient to locally reorient the polarity of nearby cells. This evidence argues that planar polarity is established by cell-cell interactions, and not by a [[morphogen|long-range polarizing cue]]. Thus, polarizing information can spread from one cell to the next, downstream of an Eve-dependent signal that remains to be identified.&lt;ref name="wie04"/&gt;

==Tensile forces==
Researchers suggest that [[mesoderm]] [[invagination]] provides an anterior-posterior pulling force that contributes to germ-band extension through passive cell shape changes. Although anterior-posterior patterning mutants fail to fully extend their germ-bands, during the fast phase the elongation length is normal despite defects in polarized cell intercalation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that an increase in cell shape stretching in the anterior-posterior axis was compensating for aberrant cell intercalation, independent of anterior-posterior patterning. Furthermore, during [[wild type]] development, it has been suggested that intercalary cell behavior relaxes the stress imposed on the germ-band, allowing stretched cells to restore to isometric shapes.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"/&gt;

In addition, there is evidence that mechanical tension is necessary and sufficient for the cortical localization of Myosin II. Thus, not only can Myosin II generate tension but it may also be up-regulated by tensile forces, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop that allows cells to dynamically respond to fluctuations in their mechanical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Gonzalez R, Simoes Sde M, Röper JC, Eaton S, Zallen JA. (2009). Myosin II dynamics are regulated by tension in intercalating cells. Dev Cell. 17, 736–743.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1969 by a consortium of universities in Eastern Canada, and several government departments, who pooled their resources in order to provide field research and teaching facilities that would complement their programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. The Huntsman Marine Laboratory was established on {{convert|20|acres}} of land that was provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and included two residential buildings that were called the Ambridge Estate. The government assisted with the purchase of the Sir Thomas Tait Estate which included another 50 acres, and the large Anderson House, which provides accommodation for visiting students. A public [[aquarium]] opened in 1972. The name was changed to Huntsman Marine Science Centre in 1987.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/html/history.html |title=History |publisher=Huntsman Marine Science Centre |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429030114/http://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/html/history.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991 and again in 1999, the HMSC was awarded the [[Gulf of Maine]] Visionary Award.&lt;ref name="ic.gc.ca2011" /&gt;

'''ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 Computer graphics, image processing and environmental data representation''' is a [[standardization]] subcommittee of the joint subcommittee [[ISO/IEC JTC1|ISO/IEC JTC 1]] of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which develops and facilitates standards within the field of [[computer graphics]], [[image processing]], and environmental data representation. The international [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 is the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) located in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=countries&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2013-11-07| author=ISO| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=45252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=analysis&gt;{{cite journal| title=Standards Analysis: ICT Sector| author=ILNAS| accessdate=2014-07-14| url=http://www.portail-qualite.public.lu/fr/publications/confiance-numerique/etudes-nationales/Pub-standards-analysis-ict-v3-0/standards-analysis-ict-sector-march-2014.pdf| version=3| pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 was formed in 1987 from ISO/TC 97 as a result of Resolution 21 at the ISO/IEC JTC 1 plenary. The group’s origins began in computer graphics, the standardization of which was originally under ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2. However, when ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 was created, the standardization activity of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2 was carried over to the new subcommittee.&lt;ref name=PHIGS&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Robert Albert Hopgood|author2=David A. Duce|title=A primer for PHIGS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYlRAAAAMAAJ|date=1 August 1991|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-93043-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial five working groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 were titled, “Architecture,” “Application programming interfaces,” “[[Metafile]]s and [[interface (computing)|interfaces]],” “[[Language binding]]s,” and “Validation, testing and registration.” The work of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 began with the [[Graphical Kernel System]] (GKS), which was adopted from ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2. However, since GKS only addressed 2D functionality, attention turned to the standardization of 3D functionality. This resulted in two standards being published: GKS-3D in 1988 and PHIGS in 1989, both of which addressed 3D functionality.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Since 1991, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 has held plenaries in a number of countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, United States, France, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Korea, United Kingdom, Australia, and Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 Standing Document No. 2: History| year=2012| edition=2| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

Located in Potsdam, Germany, the '''Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS)''' aims to identify and promote development pathways for a global transformation towards a sustainable society. The IASS employs a transdisciplinary approach that encourages dialogue to understand sustainability issues and generate potential solutions in cooperation with partners from the sciences, politics, the economy, and civil society. A strong network of national and international partners supports the work of the Institute. Its central research topics include the energy transition, emerging technologies, climate change, air quality, systemic risks, governance and participation, and cultures of transformation in the Anthropocene.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwfk.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.263439.de|title=IASS Potsdam - MWFK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The IASS currently employs around 120 persons, including Fellows from over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iass-potsdam.de/sites/default/files/files/150203_activity_deutsch_interaktiv_doppelseiten.pdf IASS Activities 2012–2013], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the Board of Directors was composed of the Institute's three Scientific Directors – [[Mark G. Lawrence]], [[Patrizia Nanz]] and [[Ortwin Renn]] – and its Head of Administration, Katja Carson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/patrizia-nanz-joins-iass-scientific-director-new-leadership-team-takes-helm|title=Patrizia Nanz Joins IASS as Scientific Director – New Leadership Team Takes the Helm - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IASS receives funding from the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Education and Research]] (85%) and the [[Brandenburg|Federal State of Brandenburg]] (15%). The Institute's research programme currently spans five areas: [[Energy transition|Transformation of Energy Systems]], Air Quality in the Context of Global Change, [[Sustainability Governance]], [[Emerging Technologies and Social Transformations in the Anthropocene]], and [[Economics and Culture]]. These research areas are supported in their work by the Cross-cutting Unit on Transdisciplinarity and Transformation, which is tasked with driving the development of theory and methodology at the IASS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute/idea/structure-bodies|title=Structure &amp; Bodies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASS is a registered voluntary association under German law. The Institute's supervisory, governing, and advisory bodies are its General Assembly, Board of Directors and Advisory Board.

== History ==
The IASS was founded in [[Potsdam]], Germany, on 2 February 2009. Germany politician and environmental policy expert [[Klaus Töpfer]] was the Institute's founding director. He led the Institute as its executive director until September 2015, together with scientific directors [[Carlo Rubbia]] (June 2010 – May 2015) and [[Mark G. Lawrence]] (from October 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/klaus-topfer-bids-farewell-iass-established-platform-dialogue-between-science-and|title=Klaus Töpfer Bids Farewell: IASS Established as a Platform for Dialogue between Science and Society - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a founding symposium held under the patronage of Angela Merkel, the then [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Minister of Education and Research]] [[Annette Schavan]] stated: "Under Professor Töpfer's leadership, the Institute will be able to gain international prominence and underscore Germany's strong position in this field."

The idea for the IASS was born in 2007 at the Potsdam Nobel Laureate Symposium "Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause". The symposium brought together leading researchers and decision-makers and resulted in the publication of the widely regarded [[Potsdam Memorandum]], which called for a concerted effort to tap into "all sources of ingenuity" to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The memorandum urged the establishment of a new "global contract" between science and society to bring together relevant knowledge within and beyond the science system to meet challenges to sustainability arising in the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute-advanced-sustainability-studies|title=Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperation ==
The IASS collaborates with numerous partners in Germany and abroad. Its major regional partners include the University of Potsdam, [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]], a research centre operated by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], and [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]].

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

'''Joachim Ernst Adolphe Felix Wach''' ({{IPA-de|vaχ|lang}}; January 25, 1898&amp;nbsp;– August 27, 1955) was a [[Germany|German]] religious scholar from [[Chemnitz]], who emphasised a distinction between the history of [[religion]] (Religionswissenschaft) and the philosophy of religion.

Wach was descended on both sides from the famous [[Mendelssohn family]], both the philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn|Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. He shared the latter's love of music and was said to have inherited some important papers and relics of his ancestor. After schooling in Dresden, he enlisted in the German army in 1916, where he served as a cavalry officer. After World War I, he studied at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1922. He taught at Leipzig University. His ''Habilitationsschrift'', entitled ''Religionswissenschaft'', is widely considered a landmark document in the field of the History of Religions.

Though Wach's family had long since converted from Judaism to Christianity, he was nonetheless driven out of his teaching post by the Nazis in the early 1930s. He was able to emigrate to the United States, where he took up a post at Brown University, first as Visiting Professor of Biblical Literature (1935–1939) and then as Associate Professor (1939–1946). Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was granted United States citizenship in 1946.

Wach taught at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1945 to 1955, becoming the chair of the History of Religions area, which had just been moved to the Divinity School from its earlier home in the Division of the Humanities. In his lectures and his writings, he emphasized a comprehensive study of religion, focusing on a) religious experience, b) religious praxis, and c) religious communities.

According to the University of Chicago Archives, Wach used the methods of the social sciences to better understand religious thought. Developing the field known as the Sociology of Religion, he maintained that the founder of a new religion experienced a revelation illuminating the way the world worked. He then began to acquire disciples who became a closely knit circle directed towards the founder with whom they each had intimate contact. The solidarity of this relationship bound the disciples together and differentiated them from other forms of social organization. Membership in the group required a break with past life and its everyday pursuits in order to focus on the new knowledge to the extent that ties of family and kinship would be relaxed or severed.

Wach died unexpectedly of a heart attack (though he had had a history of heart trouble) on August 27, 1955, in Locarno, Switzerland.

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).

In [[flight dynamics]], '''longitudinal static stability''' is the stability of an aircraft in the longitudinal, or pitching, plane under [[steady flight]] conditions. This characteristic is important in determining whether a [[Aviator|human pilot]] will be able to control the aircraft in the pitching plane without requiring excessive attention or excessive strength.&lt;ref name=LJC16&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', Chapter 16, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static stability ==
[[File:Aircraft static longitudinal stability.svg|400px|thumbnail|Three cases for static stability: following a pitch disturbance, aircraft can be either unstable, neutral, or stable.]]

As any vehicle moves it will be subjected to minor changes in the forces that act on it, and in its speed.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to restore the vehicle to its original speed and orientation, without human or machine input, the vehicle is said to be statically stable. The aircraft has positive stability.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to drive the vehicle away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be statically unstable.  The aircraft has negative stability.
* If such a change causes no tendency for the vehicle to be restored to its original speed and orientation, and no tendency for the vehicle to be driven away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be neutrally stable.  The aircraft has zero stability.

For a vehicle to possess positive static stability it is not necessary for its speed and orientation to return to exactly the speed and orientation that existed before the minor change that caused the upset.  It is sufficient that the speed and orientation do not continue to diverge but undergo at least a small change back towards the original speed and orientation.

== Longitudinal stability ==
The longitudinal stability of an aircraft refers to the aircraft's stability in the pitching plane - the plane which describes the position of the aircraft's nose in relation to its tail and the horizon.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (Other stability modes are [[directional stability]] and lateral stability.)

If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, a small increase in [[angle of attack]] will cause the [[pitching moment]] on the aircraft to change so that the angle of attack decreases.  Similarly, a small decrease in angle of attack will cause the pitching moment to change so that the angle of attack increases.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

== The pilot's task ==
The pilot of an aircraft with positive longitudinal stability, whether it is a human pilot or an [[autopilot]], has an easy task to fly the aircraft and maintain the desired pitch attitude which, in turn, makes it easy to control the speed, angle of attack and [[fuselage]] angle relative to the horizon.  The pilot of an aircraft with negative longitudinal stability has a more difficult task to fly the aircraft.  It will be necessary for the pilot devote more effort, make more frequent inputs to the elevator control, and make larger inputs, in an attempt to maintain the desired pitch attitude.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

Most successful aircraft have positive longitudinal stability, providing the aircraft's [[center of gravity]] lies within the approved range.  Some acrobatic and combat aircraft have low-positive or neutral stability to provide high maneuverability.  Some advanced aircraft have a form of low-negative stability called [[relaxed stability]] to provide extra-high maneuverability.

== Center of gravity ==
The longitudinal static stability of an aircraft is significantly influenced by the distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the [[centre of gravity]] (c.g.) and the [[aerodynamic centre]] of the airplane.  The c.g. is established by the design of the airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc.  The aerodynamic centre (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself.  In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing.  In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the [[Rutan Quickie|Quickie]], it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large.  The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.

The a.c. of an airplane typically does not change with loading or other changes; but the c.g. does, as noted above.  If the c.g. moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable (greater moment arm between the a.c. and the c.g.), and if too far forward will cause the airplane to be difficult for the pilot to bring nose-up as for landing.  If the c.g. is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the a.c. diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable; see the diagram below.

Accordingly, the operating handbook for every airplane specifies the range over which the c.g. is permitted to move.  Inside this range, the airplane is considered to be inherently stable, which is to say that it will self-correct longitudinal (pitch) disturbances without pilot input.&lt;ref&gt;"The slope of the pitching moment curve [as a function of lift coefficient] has come to be the criterion of static longitudinal stability." Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, 1949, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
&lt;!-- The following material was cut from [[Pitching moment]] and pasted here when this article (Longitudinal static stability) was created on 10 Dec 2007.  To see the history of the following material go to [[Pitching moment]] and view the history prior to 10 Dec 2007.--&gt;
Near the cruise condition most of the lift force is generated by the wings, with ideally only a small amount generated by the fuselage and tail. We may analyse the longitudinal static stability by considering the aircraft in [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] under wing lift, tail force, and weight.  The moment equilibrium condition is called [[trim (aircraft)|trim]], and we are generally interested in the longitudinal stability of the aircraft about this trim condition.

[[File:AirStability.svg]]

Equating [[force]]s in the vertical direction:
:&lt;math&gt;W=L_w+L_t&lt;/math&gt;
where W is the weight, &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing lift and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force.  

For a thin airfoil at low [[angle of attack]], the wing lift is proportional to the angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;L_w=qS_w\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha} (\alpha-\alpha_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing area &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt; is the (wing) [[lift coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of attack.  The term &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is included to account for camber, which results in lift at zero angle of attack. Finally &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic pressure]]:
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[air density]] and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the speed.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, NY, 1949, p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This ref has been dropped in here as the best place for it, but somebody needs to check that it does bear out the above analysis --&gt;

===Trim===
The force from the tailplane is proportional to its angle of attack, including the effects of any elevator deflection and any adjustment the pilot has made to trim-out any stick force.  In addition, the tail is located in the flow field of the main wing, and consequently experiences  [[downwash]], reducing its angle of attack. 

In a statically stable aircraft of conventional (tail in rear) configuration, the [[tailplane]] force may act upward or downward depending on the design and the flight conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = BRA | last = Burns | title = Canards: Design with Care | newspaper = Flight International | date = 23 February 1985 | pages = 19–21 | quote = It is a misconception that tailed aeroplanes always carry tailplane downloads. They usually do, with flaps down and at forward c.g. positions, but with flaps up at the c.g. aft, tail loads at high lift are frequently positive (up), although the tail's maximum lifting capability is rarely approached.}}.[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200561.html p.19][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200562.html p.20][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200563.html p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical canard aircraft both fore and aft planes are lifting surfaces. The fundamental requirement for static stability is that the aft surface must have greater authority (leverage) in restoring a disturbance than the forward surface has in exacerbating it.  This leverage is a product of moment arm from the center of mass and surface area. Correctly balanced in this way, the partial derivative of pitching moment with respect to changes in angle of attack will be negative: a momentary pitch up to a larger angle of attack makes the resultant pitching moment tend to pitch the aircraft back down. (Here, pitch is used casually for the angle between the nose and the direction of the airflow; angle of attack.) This is the "stability derivative" d(M)/d(alpha), described below. 

The tail force is, therefore:
:&lt;math&gt; L_t=q S_t\left(\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}\left(\alpha-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\alpha\right)+\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \eta}\eta\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail area, &lt;math&gt;C_l\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\eta\!&lt;/math&gt; is the elevator deflection, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\!&lt;/math&gt; is the downwash angle.

A canard aircraft may have its foreplane rigged at a high angle of incidence, which can be seen in a canard catapult glider from a toy store; the design puts the c.g. well forward, requiring nose-up lift.

Violations of the basic principle are exploited in some high performance "relaxed static stability" combat aircraft to enhance agility; artificial stability is supplied by active electronic means.

There are a few classical cases where this favourable response was not achieved, notably some early T-tail jet aircraft. In the event of a very high angle of attack, the horizontal stabilizer became immersed in downwash from the wing and fuselage, causing excessive download on the stabilizer, increasing the angle of attack still further. The only way an aircraft could recover from this situation was by jettisoning tail ballast or deploying a special tail parachute.  The phenomenon became known as '[[Stall (flight)#Deep stall|deep stall]]'.

Taking moments about the [[center of gravity]], the net nose-up moment is:
:&lt;math&gt;M=L_w x_g-(l_t-x_g)L_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_g\!&lt;/math&gt; is the location of the center of gravity behind the [[aerodynamic center]] of the main wing, &lt;math&gt;l_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail moment arm.
For trim, this moment must be zero.  For a given maximum elevator deflection, there is a corresponding limit on center of gravity position at which the aircraft can be kept in equilibrium.  When limited by control deflection this is known as a 'trim limit'.  In principle trim limits could determine the permissible forwards and rearwards shift of the centre of gravity, but usually it is only the forward cg limit which is determined by the available control, the aft limit is usually dictated by stability.

In a missile context 'trim limit' more usually refers to the maximum angle of attack, and hence lateral acceleration which can be generated.

===Static stability===
The nature of stability may be examined by considering the increment in pitching moment with change in angle of attack at the trim condition.  If this is nose up, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable; if nose down it is stable.  Differentiating the moment equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=x_g\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}-(l_t-x_g)\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
Note: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Stability derivatives|stability derivative]].

It is convenient to treat total lift as acting at a distance h ahead of the centre of gravity, so that the moment equation may be written:
:&lt;math&gt;M=h(L_w+L_t)\!&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the increment in angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=h\left(\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Equating the two expressions for moment increment:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-l_t\frac {\frac {\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
The total lift &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; so the sum in the denominator can be simplified and written as the derivative of the total lift due to angle of attack, yielding:
:&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{x_g}{c}-\left(1-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\right)\frac{\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha}}\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
Where c is the [[mean aerodynamic chord]] of the main wing.  The term:
:&lt;math&gt;V_t=\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the tail volume ratio.  Its rather complicated coefficient{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- why is it complicated? --&gt;, the ratio of the two lift derivatives, has values in the range of 0.50 to 0.65 for typical configurations, according to Piercy.  Hence the expression for h may be written more compactly, though somewhat approximately, as:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-0.5 cV_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
h is known as the [[static margin]].  For stability it must be negative. (However, for consistency of language, the static margin is sometimes taken as &lt;math&gt;-h&lt;/math&gt;, so that positive stability is associated with positive static margin.)

== Neutral point ==
A mathematical analysis of the longitudinal static stability of a complete aircraft (including horizontal stabilizer) yields the position of center of gravity at which stability is neutral.  This position is called the neutral point.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (The larger the area of the horizontal stabilizer, and the greater the moment arm of the horizontal stabilizer about the aerodynamic center, the further aft is the neutral point.)

The static center of gravity margin (c.g. margin) or [[static margin]] is the distance between the center of gravity (or mass) and the neutral point.  It is usually quoted as a percentage of the [[Chord (aircraft)|Mean Aerodynamic Chord]].  The center of gravity must lie ahead of the neutral point for positive stability (positive static margin). If the center of gravity is behind the neutral point, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable (the static margin is negative), and active inputs to the control surfaces are required to maintain stable flight.  Some combat aircraft that are controlled by [[fly-by-wire]] systems are designed to be longitudinally unstable so they will be highly maneuverable.  Ultimately, the position of the center of gravity relative to the neutral point determines the stability, control forces, and controllability of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

For a [[tailless aircraft]] &lt;math&gt;V_t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the neutral point coincides with the aerodynamic center, and so for longitudinal static stability the center of gravity must lie ahead of the aerodynamic center.

== Longitudinal dynamic stability ==

An aircraft’s static stability is an important, but not sufficient, measure of its handling characteristics, and whether it can be flown with ease and comfort by a human pilot. In particular, the [[longitudinal dynamic stability]] of a statically stable aircraft will determine whether or not it is finally able to return to its original position.

==Background==
The Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC) studies of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936) are follow-up studies of, respectively, the Scottish Mental Surveys (SMSs) of 1932 (SMS1932) and 1947 (SMS1947).&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The Scottish Mental Surveys, which were undertaken by the [[Scottish Council for Research in Education]] (SCRE), are the only attempts to date of any country to measure the intelligence of a complete year-of-birth in its population.&lt;ref name="CCACE, 2015"&gt;CCACE (2015).

==Design and aims==
A core aim of the LBC studies is to explore causes of different cognitive ageing outcomes.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; They have also been used to facilitate a variety of psychosocial, medical and genetic investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

Each wave of data collection typically includes: cognitive tests; socio-demographic information; health behaviours and health status; fitness measures; and physical measures.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; Metabolic and inflammatory [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] have also been taken in both cohorts.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The studies have been funded by a variety of sources, including but not limited to the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]], the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], the Scottish Government's [[Chief Scientist Office (Scotland)|Chief Scientist Office]], [[Age UK]] and [[Research into Ageing]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;

===Lothian Birth Cohort 1921===
LBC1921 participant recruitment began in 1999.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt; Participants were mainly recruited by tracing SMS1932 participants in the Edinburgh area using the [[National Health Service Central Register#Community Health Index|Community Health Index]] (CHI), and then asking general practitioners to contact the traced potential LBC participants.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

The LBC1921 study's main initial aim was to find molecular genetic markers of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; This included the investigation of the influence of the E4 [[allele]] on the [[Apolipoprotein E]] (''APOE'') gene on cognitive ageing as well as testing the effects of other [[candidate gene]]s for cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; A later research focus was examining relationships involving [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) from genes linked to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; The third and fourth waves of data collection were conducted with the main objective of testing the common cause hypothesis of cognitive ageing,&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; which puts forward that age-related declines in physical and cognitive functioning share a common cause.&lt;ref name="Christensen et al., 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The "common cause hypothesis" of cognitive aging: Evidence for not only a common factor but also specific associations of age with vision and grip strength in a cross-sectional analysis.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2001|volume = 16|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.588|first = Helen|last = Christensen|first2 = Andrew J.|last2 = Mackinnon|first3 = Ailsa|last3 = Korten|first4 = Anthony F.|last4 = Jorm|pages=588–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LBC1936 study began with the wider objective of investigating a diverse range of influences on cognitive ageing, including the effects of economic, medical, psychological and social variables.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For Wave 2, a specific focus was placed on finding how the white matter of the brain becomes damaged and what relationship white matter damage has with age-related cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wardlaw et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain aging, cognition in youth and old age and vascular disease in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936: rationale, design and methodology of the imaging protocol*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x/abstract|journal = International Journal of Stroke|date = 1 December 2011|issn = 1747-4949|pages = 547–559|volume = 6|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1747-4949.2011.00683.x|first = Joanna M.|last = Wardlaw|first2 = Mark E.|last2 = Bastin|first3 = Maria C.|last3 = Valdés Hernández|first4 = Susana Muñoz|last4 = Maniega|first5 = Natalie A.|last5 = Royle|first6 = Zoe|last6 = Morris|first7 = Jonathan D.|last7 = Clayden|first8 = Elaine M.|last8 = Sandeman|first9 = Elizabeth|last9 = Eadie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
As well as being used to research the topics of major findings outlined below, LBC data has been used in a diverse range of other investigations.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2012" /&gt; For example, LBC1921 participants served as a [[control group]] in a study that validated of the use of the [[National Adult Reading Test]] as a measure of [[Morbidity|premorbid]] cognition in individuals with [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="McGurn et al., 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pronunciation of irregular words is preserved in dementia, validating premorbid IQ estimation|url = http://www.neurology.org/content/62/7/1184|journal = Neurology|date = 13 April 2004|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 15079021|pages = 1184–1186|volume = 62|issue = 7|doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000103169.80910.8B|first = B.|last = McGurn|first2 = J.

===Stability of intelligence===
[[File:Longitudinal correlations of Moray House Test scores in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921.png|alt=In the LBC1921, age 11 Moray House Test scores correlated .66, .51 and .55 with scores at ages 79, 87 and 90 respectively.

Age 87 scores correlated .87 with age 90 scores.|thumb|Path diagram of raw correlations&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; (displayed on the double-headed arrows) between Moray House Test scores at different ages (displayed within square boxes) in the LBC1921.]]

Studies of the LBC1921 have provided the longest-term estimates of the stability of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; They have found that intelligence in childhood is [[Effect size#Pearson r or correlation coefficient|strongly correlated]] with intelligence in old age, and that this correlation exists because intelligence is highly stable trait, rather than because childhood intelligence is linked to rates of cognitive change during adulthood.

The LBC1921 took the Moray House Test at ages 11, 79, 87 and 90, and results at all four sittings were strongly correlated. The raw correlations between test scores at age 11 and at ages 79, 87 and 90 were .66, .51 and .55 respectively, and they rose to .73, .61 and .67 respectively after correction for the restriction of [[Range (statistics)|range]] in the LBC1921 sample.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stability and change in intelligence from age 11 to ages 70, 79, and 87: The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0021072|journal = Psychology and Aging|date = 1 January 2011|volume = 26|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/a0021072|first = Alan J.|last = Gow|first2 = Wendy|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Alison|last3 = Pattie|first4 = Caroline E.|last4 = Brett|first5 = Beverly|last5 = Roberts|first6 = John M.|last6 = Starr|first7 = Ian J.|last7 = Deary|pages=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range restriction-corrected correlation coefficients represent the best estimate of the stability of intelligence across the entire population of SMS1932 participants, and indicate that intelligence is a very stable trait.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2013" /&gt; Even the corrected coefficients may underestimate the strength of the correlation, as the [[Test-retest reliability|reliability]] of the test is likely below 1.0.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2004" /&gt;

Although age 11 intelligence is related to old age intelligence, it has been reported to be unrelated to change in intelligence between ages 79 and 87 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt; This finding suggested that childhood intelligence is related to old age intelligence because of the stability of intelligence rather than because it protects against decline in old age.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;
 
The LBC1936 also re-sat the Moray House Test in old age. In this larger cohort, there was a strong correlation between scores at ages 11 and 70 of .67.&lt;ref name="Gow et al., 2011" /&gt;

===Genetic associations===
[[File:PBB Protein APOE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Apolipoprotein E.|Apolipoprotein E.]]

The most consistent genetic finding from the LBC studies has been that the E4 allele on the ''APOE'' gene, which had previously been known to be a risk factor for late-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref name="Corder et al., 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late onset families|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/261/5123/921|journal = Science|date = 13 August 1993|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 8346443|pages = 921–923|volume = 261|issue = 5123|doi = 10.1126/science.8346443|first = E.

D.|last7 = Roses|first8 = J. L.|last8 = Haines|first9 = M. A.|last9 = Pericak-Vance}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also adversely linked to non-pathological cognitive function and change.

In an early LBC1921 study, E4 allele status was unrelated to Moray House Test scores at age 11, but at age 80 those with an E4 allele scored lower than those without an E4 allele, indicating that the allele is a risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2002" /&gt; Later LBC1921 research found that possession of the E4 allele was associated with greater decline in abstract reasoning and verbal memory, but not verbal fluency, between age 79 and age 87.&lt;ref name="Schiepers et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiepers O.

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association (GWA) studies]] have confirmed the ''APOE'' E4 allele's association with worse cognitive decline and function. A GWA study of longitudinal cohorts, including the LBC1921 and the LBC1936, found that the ''APOE'' E4 allele was associated with deleterious cognitive change.&lt;ref name="Davies et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies G. |author2=Harris S.

===White matter integrity===

[[File:3DSlicer-KubickiJPR2007-fig6.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The structure of the white matter of the human brain.|The structure of the white matter of the human brain.]]

Structural [[magnetic resonance imaging]] brain scans from LBC1936 participants have been used to observe that the integrity of white matter tracts in the brain is linked to cognitive functioning and successful cognitive ageing. In one study, three general [[Factor analysis|factors]] of white matter tract integrity combined to explain 10% of the variance in general intelligence, and this effect was fully [[Mediation (statistics)|mediated]] through processing speed.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S.

E. |author3=Penke L. |author4=Maniega S. M. |author5=Murray C. |author6=Royle N. A. |author7=Deary I.

White matter integrity has also been shown to relate to cognitive change. Specifically, white matter integrity in the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum has been found to be a marker of healthy cognitive ageing.&lt;ref name="Penke et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Penke L. |author2=Maniega S.

Additionally, white matter integrity in some brain areas has been found to be weaker in ''APOE'' E4 allele carriers,&lt;ref name="Lyall et al., 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lyall D.

===Health, health behaviours and cognitive ageing===

In the LBC1921, smoking was linked to greater cognitive decline at age 80.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I. J. |author2=Pattie A. |author3=Taylor M.

Physical fitness, indexed by a general [[Principal component analysis|component]] extracted from measures of lung function, grip strength and walk time, was associated with successful cognitive ageing at age 79 in the LBC1921.&lt;ref name="Deary et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deary I.

One of the strengths of the LBC study designs is that they enable tests of [[reverse causation]] in associations between intelligence and other variables. Reverse causation is implied if a contemporaneous association in old age is attenuated or eliminated after childhood intelligence is controlled for, which would suggest that the association existed partially or wholly due to the effects of earlier intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1588">'''Mean time (to) first failure (MTFF''', sometimes '''MTTFF)''' is a concept in [[reliability engineering]].

It describes time to failure for [[consumable|non-repairable]] components like an [[integrated circuit]] soldered on a circuit board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For [[repairable]] components like
a replaceable light bulb the concept of [[mean time between failures]] is used to describe the [[failure rate]].

'''MTFF''' and '''MTTF''' (mean time to failure) have identical meanings.
The key is that this is a non-repairable and non-recoverable failure. For example, the failure of a TV typically isn't measured by this criterion because the TV can be repaired. However, if this failure was due to a burned out integrated circuit that circuit itself can't be repaired and must be replaced. The failure of that circuit is measured by mean time to failure. It's generally used to predict the first failure after manufacturing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weibull.com/SystemRelWeb/general_simulation_results.htm |title=Weibull General Simulation Results |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixsigmaspc.com/dictionary/MTTF-meantimetofailure.html |title=Sigma Six Quality Control Dictionary and Glossary

'''Mireia Boya Busquet''' (born 1979) is a Catalan scientist, activist, and politician. She is a councilor of the [[Val d'Aran|Aran]] municipality of [[Les, Catalonia|Les]]. Since February 2018 she has been part of the national secretariat of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy]] (CUP). She was a member of the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan Parliament]] from 2016 to 2017.

==Biography==
The daughter of Ernesto Boya and the politician {{ill|Maria Pilar Busquets|es}}, she has a degree in [[Environmental Science]]s from the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (2002), a master's degree in Landscape Design (2004), and a PhD in Land Management and Planning (2009) from the [[Université de Montréal]]. In the professional field, she is a consultant and associate professor of the Humanities Department of [[Pompeu Fabra University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/la-cup-renova-el-40-dels-diputats-al-parlament/ |title=La CUP renova el 40% dels diputats que té al parlament |trans-title=The CUP Renews 40% of MPs in Parliament |work=[[VilaWeb]] |language=Catalan |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mireia Boya Busquet has been a fighter for the recognition of [[Val d'Aran|Occitan]] identity of the Valley of Aran, and was the first member of the Catalan Parliament to use the [[Aranese dialect]] in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.esdiario.com/895533049/Rozando-el-esperpento-la-nueva-diputada-de-CUP-solo-hablara-en-aranes.html |title=Rozando el esperpento: la nueva diputada de CUP sólo hablará en aranés |trans-title=Grazing the Grotesque: The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese |work=ESDiario.com |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, {{ill|Jusèp Boya Busquet|es}}, has been general director of Archives, Libraries, Museum, and Heritage of the Generalitat beginning in January 2016, an office that he was dismissed from after the 2017 suspension of Catalonian self-government.

==Political career==
Boya is a founder and former coordinator of the [[Assemblea Nacional Catalana]] in Val d'Aran and councilor in the city of [[Les, Catalonia|Les]] for the [[Corròp]] party, framed in [[Occitan nationalism]]. In the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|2015 elections to the Parliament of Catalonia]], she was a candidate of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP]] for the district of [[Province of Lleida|Lleida]], after a vote in primaries. Boya, who was second in the list in her constituency, was not elected, but on 18 December 2015, during the tense negotiations between the CUP and the pro-independence coalition [[Junts pel Sí]], the CUP's number one, Ramon Usall, resigned for personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20151219/30915108732/diputado-cup-renuncia-ramon-usall.html |title=Voto secreto en la asamblea de la CUP para decidir si se inviste a Artur Mas |trans-title=Secret Vote in the CUP Assembly to Decide Whether to Invest Artur Mas |first=Àlex |last=Tort |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |language=Spanish |date=19 December 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Boya occupied the post of regional parliamentarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.naciodigital.cat/lleida/noticia/16111/mireia/boya/sera/diputada/cup/substitucio/ramon/usall |title=Mireia Boya serà diputada de la CUP en substitució de Ramon Usall |trans-title=Mireia Boya to be CUP Deputy as Substitute for Ramon Usall |first=Àlvar |last=Llobet |work=Nació Digital |language=Catalan |date=10 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jornalet.com/nova/5499/una-occitanista-aranesa-candidata-al-parlament-de-catalonha-per-la-cup |title=Una occitanista aranesa candidata al Parlament de Catalonha per la CUP |trans-title=An Occitan Aranese Candidate for the Parliament of Catalonia for the CUP |work=Jornalet |language=Catalan |date=31 July 2015 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in the plenary sessions of the Parliament that voted for the roadmap to independence for Catalonia, and voted the Unilateral declaration of Independence of Catalonia.

In the elections of 21 December 2017, of the 5,265 votes cast in Val d'Aran, the CUP received 174 – 3.3% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2017/autonomicas/09/25-39.html |title=Resultados Electorales en Aran: Elecciones Cataluña 2017 |trans-title=Electoral Results in Aran: Catalan Elections 2017 |work=[[El País]] |language=Spanish |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, she was elected a member of the CUP National Secretariat as an independent candidate with 662 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180216/44820594186/la-cup-renueva-su-cupula-con-equilibrios-internos-pese-al-exito-de-endavant.html |title=La CUP renueva su cúpula con equilibrios entre Endavant y Poble Lliure |trans-title=The CUP Renews its Leadership with Balances Between Endavant and Poble Lliure |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |agency=EFE |location=Barcelona |language=Spanish |date=16 February 2018 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occitan nationalism===
A defender of the [[Occitania|Occitan nation]], Boya upholds a "project of a country with two languages of its own", a country that looks "to the north, to Occitania".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160120/301542079265/diputada-cup-aranes-parlament.html |title=La nueva diputada de la CUP sólo hablará en aranés en la tribuna |trans-title=The New CUP Deputy Will Only Speak in Aranese at the Rostrum |first=Quico |last=Sallés |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |location=Barcelona |language=Spanish |date=20 January 2016 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial case==
On 22 December 2017, Judge Pablo Llarena of the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] agreed on the inquiry (previously charged) for rebellion against Mireia Boya (president of the CUP's parliamentary group), [[Artur Mas]] (president of the [[Catalan European Democratic Party|PDeCat]]), [[Marta Rovira]] (secretary general of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]]), [[Anna Gabriel i Sabaté|Anna Gabriel]] (spokesperson of the CUP), [[Marta Pascal]] (general coordinator of the CUP), and {{ill|Neus Lloveras|es}} (president of the [[Association of Municipalities for Independence|AMI]]), all for belonging to the organizing team of the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|Catalan independence referendum]] held on 1 October 2017 and with a decisive role in the secessionist plan, whose roadmap was annulled by the Spanish Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-supremo-investiga-mas-rovira-y-gabriel-rebelion-201712221105_noticia.html |title=El juez imputa a Marta Rovira, Artur Mas y Anna Gabriel en la causa por rebelión |trans-title=The Judge Accuses Marta Rovira, Artur Mas, and Anna Gabriel in the Case for Rebellion |first1=Nati |last1=Villanueva |first2=Luis P. |last2=Arechederra |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |language=Spanish |date=22 December 2017 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://okdiario.com/espana/cataluna/2017/12/22/imputada-boya-cup-sostiene-decision-del-supremo-venganza-1631314 |title=La imputada Boya (CUP) sostiene que la decisión del Supremo es una 'venganza' |trans-title=The Accused Boya (CUP) Maintains that the Supreme's Decision is a 'Revenge' |work=Okdiario |language=Spanish |date=22 December 2017 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boya was declared as investigated on 14 February 2018, being released without precautionary measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-mireia-boya-declara-ante-5733616839001-20180214011307_video.html |title=Mireia Boya declara ante el Tribunal Supremo |trans-title=Mireia Boya Testifies Before the Supreme Court |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |language=Spanish |date=14 February 2018 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography''' ({{lang-hr|Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža}} or '''LZMK''') is [[Croatia]]'s national [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] institution. Based in [[Zagreb]], it was originally established in 1950 as the national lexicographical institute of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It was renamed after the Croatian writer and its founder [[Miroslav Krleža]] in 1983.

== History ==

The institute was founded in 1950 as the Lexicographical Institute of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (''Leksikografski zavod FNRJ'') and was renamed the '''Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute''' (''Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod'', '''''JLZ''''') in 1964.

Its longtime director was [[Miroslav Krleža]], with [[Mate Ujević]] as the chief editor. It was based in [[Zagreb]], with branches in [[Ljubljana]] and [[Belgrade]].

After Krleža's death in 1981, the institute was renamed as the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute "Miroslav Krleža" (''Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod "Miroslav Krleža"'').

Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], it was renamed to its current name in 1991, becoming the national lexicographical institute of [[Croatia]], situated in 26 [[Frankopan]] Street of Zagreb.

== Publications ==
The institute employs numerous scientists in many areas of expertise and issues general and specific [[reference work]]s as well as [[map]]s and [[travel guide]]s. Some notable works started or completed by the institute:

* ''[[Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia]]'' (''Enciklopedija Jugoslavije'') – 1st ed. in 8 volumes (1955–71); 2nd ed. with only 6 out of the planned 12 volumes released (1980–90)

[[File:Ninian Smart.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ninian Smart]]
'''Roderick Ninian Smart''' (6 May 1927 – 9 January 2001) was a Scottish writer and university educator. He was a pioneer in the field of secular [[religious studies]]. In 1967 he established the first department of [[religious studies]] in the United Kingdom at the new [[University of Lancaster]] where he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor, having already chaired one of the largest and most prestigious departments of theology in Britain at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1976, he became the first J.F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Smart presented the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1979–80. In 1996, he was named the Academic Senate's Research Professor, the highest professorial rank at [[UC Santa Barbara]]. In 2000, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]], while simultaneously retaining his status as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. Smart held both titles at the time of his death.

Smart became widely known outside the Academy, at least in Britain, when he was editorial consultant for the major [[BBC]] television series, ''[[The Long Search]]'' (1977). His book ''The World's Religions'' (1989) also reached a considerable popular readership. His defence of religious studies as a secular discipline helped the formation of departments in many public universities, especially in the United States. He distanced religious studies from traditional theology in that evaluating truth claims and apology have no role but regarded investigation into the "truth and worth" of religion ''per se'' as a valid academic enterprise in the public arena of [[Public university|state-funded education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ninian Smart was born in [[Cambridge]], England, where his father, [[William Marshall Smart]] (1889–1975) was the [[John Couch Adams|John Couch Adams Astronomer]] in the [[University of Cambridge]].  His mother was Isabel (née Carswell). W. M Smart, who died in 1975, also served as President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1950).
Both parents were Scottish. They moved to Glasgow in 1937, when W. M. Smart became [[Regius Professor of Astronomy, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Astronomy]] (retiring in 1959).

Smart was one of three brothers, all of whom became professors: [[J. J. C. Smart|Jack]] (1920–2012) became a professor of philosophy; Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at the [[University of Nottingham]]. 

Smart attended the [[Glasgow Academy]] before joining the military in 1945, serving until 1948, in the [[British Army Intelligence Corps]] where he learned Chinese (via [[Confucian]] texts) mainly at the London School of Oriental and African Studies and had his first extended contact with Sri Lankan [[Buddhism]]. It was this experience that roused him from what he called his "Western slumber with the call of diverse and noble cultures."&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the army – as a captain – with a scholarship to Queen's College, [[University of Oxford]], he reverted to his Glasgow major, classics and philosophy, mainly because Chinese and Oriental studies in those days had "pathetic curricula". However, for his B.Phil. work he returned to world religions, writing what he later described as "the first dissertation in Oxford on philosophy of religion after World War II".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Lancaster University's Chaplaincy Centre]]

==Career==
After teaching in the [[University of Wales]] from 1952 until 1955, Smart spent a year as a visiting lecturer at [[Yale University]], where he also studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]], the language of the [[Buddhist scriptures]]. In 1956, he was appointed Lecturer in the [[University of London]], then in 1961 at the very young age of 34 – extraordinarily young for a full chair in the British system – he became the first H. G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]] – one of the largest departments of theology, where he also served as head of department. By now author of several publications, including ''Reasons and Faiths'' (1958), based on his B.Phil work and ''World Religions: A Dialogue'' (1960), Smart was a rising star in the newly developing field of Religious Studies, rather than in Theology, despite the name of the chair he occupied. Already known internationally, he received several offers to take up positions in North America, including as Chair of the [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] Departments, and an invitation to apply for a chair at Oxford. However, he was already involved in a consultative capacity in forming the first major department of Religious Studies at the new [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], and found himself "cajoled from being adviser to being candidate" for the Chair.

Despite the attraction of prestigious posts elsewhere, he chose [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] because it represented a "[[tabula rasa]], a new field" where he could practice his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up appointment in 1967, as Foundation Professor of Religious Studies. His tenure at [[Birmingham University]] had also done much to shift the department from an exclusive focus on [[Christianity]] to encompass [[world religions]]. His successor at Birmingham, [[John Hick]], would emerge as the most well-known exponent of a pluralist [[theology of religions]]. Between 1969 and 1972, he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor at Lancaster. In 1977, Smart started to divide his time between Lancaster and another new venture, the Religious studies department at the [[University of California|University of California, Santa Barbara]] (1976–98) where he became the first J. F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at Santa Barbara, from 1988 (he was a professor from 1976). As at Birmingham and Lancaster, he was again also department chair.  He spent six months of each year at each campus. In 1996, he was named Research Professor at Santa Barbara, the highest academic honour.  Toward the end of his career, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]].  Proud of his [[Scottish identity]], he often wore his [[kilt]] on campus at Santa Barbara, where he was renowned for riding his bicycle very slowly, for "his bow ties and the ever-present flower in his lapel, and most of all the twinkle in his eye."&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Hecht|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/roderickniniansmart.htm |title=In Memoriam: Roderick Ninian Smart |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ucsbuniversitycenterandstorketower.jpg|thumb|right|The University of California at Santa Barbara University Center and Lagoon]]At Lancaster he was respected by his students for being so accessible, for his willingness to engage his formidable intellect without pretension in informal debate over a pint in the bar.{{cn|date=June 2015}}&lt;!-- do not remove this unless you have a proper referenced source to replace it.--&gt;

===Visiting professorships and lectures===
Smart was also visiting professor at [[Varanasi]] in India, [[Yale]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Queensland|Queensland]], and the respected Religious Studies department at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|Lampeter]], in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Lectures delivered in Delhi were published as ''The Yogi and the Devotee'' (1968). In 1967, he presented the Heslington Lectures at the [[University of York]], in which he set out his ideas about secular Religious Studies subsequently published as ''Secular Education and the Logic of Religion'' (1967), further developing these in his inaugural lecture at Lancaster, published as ''Concept and Empathy'' (1986). In 1979–80, he presented the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]], published as ''Beyond Ideology'' (1981).

===Activism===
In addition to teaching, research, and writing, Smart was something of an activist in promoting improved cross-cultural understanding.  In the 1970s, he was involved in several initiatives in Britain to broaden the public [[religious education]] curriculum, previously purely [[Christian]], to include the range of [[world religions]].  He also served on the [[National Schools Council]] advising on broadening the religious education curriculum. The teaching of religion in the state school system in the United Kingdom, which is mandatory, distinguishes teaching about religion from faith-nurture, which is not properly part of the task.  Smart was involved in the Assembly of the World's Religions series of meetings (1985, 1990, 1992) sponsored by [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church|Unification movement]] and served as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. In 1999, he was co-convener of the First Assembly of the Inter-religious and International Federation for World Peace, established by Moon. Smart reiterated his conviction that without improved understanding of the religious and cultural [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], peace in the world would remain elusive. His concept of religions as [[worldviews]], and his value-free approach to religious studies – that is, refraining from elevating a single understanding of "truth" as some sort of evaluative criterion of religious authenticity-opened up for him the study of non-religious [[ideologies]] or worldviews (he preferred this term because it does not imply that theism is an essential element) as well as of new religious movements, which he saw as one result of globalisation.  He also wrote the foreword for the Unification publication, ''World Scripture,'' edited by [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], in which he stated that, "it is obvious that as we move toward a world civilization, in which so many cultures and spiritual traditions will impinge on one another, all of us should understand one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart was also a member of the International Board of the Global Ethics and Religion Forum, an educational, non-profit NGO dedicated to increasing global ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Ethics and Religion Forum, [http://www.gerforum.org/ The Global Religion and Ethics Forum.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic honours===
Smart received honorary doctorates from [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]] (1970), [[Glasgow University]] (1984), [[Stirling University]] (1986) [[University of Kelaniya]], Sri Lanka (1991), and Lancaster (1995) as well as an Honorary Fellowship from [[the Queen's College, Oxford]] (1999). He was made a Life Member of the International Association for the History of Religion (1995).

In 1994, the volume ''Aspects of Religion'', edited by Peter Masefield and Donald Wiebe, was published in his honour.

===Retirement and death===
Smart officially retired from Lancaster in 1982 (he was Honorary Professor from 1982 to 1989, then Professor Emeritus) and from Santa Barbara in 1998, but remained active as a professor emeritus in both universities, living mainly in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], where he died in 2001 from a massive stroke, aged 73.

==Scholarly contribution==
Smart is mainly noted for his contribution in the area of methodology, although he saw his contribution as conceptual as well as methodological, commenting that while expertise in languages was not to be dismissed, it should not be "rated above conceptual insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Religious Studies dates from the mid-1960s, when new departments were established, several in state universities in the United States. At the time, it was only just beginning to earn academic recognition and Smart was a pivotal figure in this process and, as Cunningham comments, "it is difficult not to recall that the emergence of Religious Studies as a higher education subject was then controversial."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cunningham, [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article34994.ece Professor Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's early work involved linguistic analysis, in which he had trained at Oxford. Later, he said that this came close to "cross-cultural study" but had stopped short, since he was still too captive to "our language" and "various assumptions of our culture".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"/&gt; However, when he came to publish this he included later conceptual ideas, expanding his dissertation. Interested in [[Rudolf Otto]]'s concept of the Holy as a key to understanding religion, he found this too restrictive, since [[Buddhism]] is [[non-theistic]]. Instead, he suggested that religious experience can be either [[numinous]] or [[mystical]].  He was also influenced by [[R.C. Zaehner]]'s interest in mysticism, having consulted him at Oxford. He then examined what he took as key religious concepts, such as [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and [[knowledge]] and analysed what these meant in Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and Buddhism without evaluating any belief in terms of truth or falsity. He was consciously attempting to break out of captivity to Western modes of thought so that for example theism is not taken as an essential component of religion, thus such ideas as [[theophany]] or a single ultimate focus or sacrifice do not necessarily translate from the Christian into other religious contexts.  "She who knows but one religion knows none," said Smart.&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"/&gt; Western concern for [[doctrine]] overlooked the importance of [[religious experience]]. Early in his career, he insisted that an [[ideology]] such as [[Marxism]] as well as [[nationalism]] and [[rationalism]] could be considered religious, because they resemble religious traditions in how they function, and therefore properly belong to Religious Studies, the subject matter of which was "non-finite".  

He situated Religious Studies in contrast to [[theology]] as [[agnostic]] on the truth of religious claims but he was critical of [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] for "assuming the non-existence of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies is, however, interested in why people believe that their religious statements or experience is true, thus description, although vital, must "transcend the informative" and engage in dialogue with "the para-historical claims of religions and anti-religious outlooks". It need not be hostile to the type of committed approach pursued in theology "provided it is open, and does not artificially restrict understanding and choice". It is not concerned with evangelising but with elucidating understanding, or meaning. Religious Studies, too, has a vital role to play in combating tribalism, that is, human captivity to its own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies as a non-confessional, methodologically agnostic discipline takes its place in the secular academy, where it draw heavily on [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], history, [[archaeology]], and other disciplines.  At bottom, it has a place in the public or state sector because, as an aspect of human experience, it is also the study of people – of what they believe, why they believe and act as they do, both individually and within society. It is a constantly changing field because religions change as religious people adapt to new circumstances.  Religious Studies is never exclusively interested in what might be termed orthodoxy—however a religion itself might enforce or police conformity to an official version – but with religion as it is lived, with "religion on the ground," a term he first used in 1978.&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; Responses to modernity, to globalisation, as well as trends towards religious eclecticism, properly concern Religious Studies. Smart did not anticipate a single, eclectic religion emerging but that religions would increasingly borrow from one another and that a global consensus on the value of religion in society would evolve. In interview with Scott London, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I … believe we are moving toward a global ideology that has a place for religion and recognizes the contributions of the different traditions. Hopefully, it will have an overarching view as to how we can work together for the promotion of human values and spirituality.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;Scott London, [http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/smart.html The Future of Religion: An Interview with Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dimensions of religion===
Smart is widely known for his seven-part definition of religion, or rather scheme of study; as this approach avoids the problem of defining altogether. Whatever else religion may or may not be – whether theistic or non-theistic, religions possess certain recognisable elements, which can be studied. These dimensions vary in importance but are almost always present. Smart divided these into "historical" and "para-historical," meaning by the latter those dimensions that take the investigation into the experience, or inner lives, or religious people. The "historical" can be studied empirically, the para-historical takes the student into the realm of belief and concepts and requires dialogue and participation; "since the study of man is in an important sense participatory – for one has to enter into men's intentions, beliefs, myths, desires, in order to understand why they act as they do – it is fatal if cultures including our own are described merely externally, without entering into dialogue with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Smart's sevenfold scheme of study:
#Doctrinal
#Mythological
#Ethical
#Ritual
#Experiential
#Institutional
#Material (added in his 1989 text, ''The World's Religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rennie|first1=Bryan S|title=The View of the Invisible World: Ninian Smart's Analysis of the Dimensions of Religion and of Religious Experience|url=http://www.westminster.edu/staff/brennie/RennieCSSR28.3.pdf|website=Westminster|publisher=ATLAS|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Note:  Smart categorised 1–3 as para-historical and 4–6 as historical.

==Legacy==
Smart’s contribution to Religious Studies continues to influence curricula, syllabi and methodology. In particular, his "dimensions of religion," a framework for comparing religions, has been influential within the academy. His willingness to take seriously what others saw as "illegitimate," such as ideologies and new religious movements, did much to allow Religious Studies to distinguish itself from theology and from any charge of privileging any particular faith or version of a faith. Hecht commented that, "When the definitive history of the study of religion in the 20th century is written..." Ninian Smart "will certainly be seen as a giant among his peers" since Smart's "many books opened religion to scholar and layperson alike".&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; The Ninian Smart Annual Memorial Lecture, created in his honour, alternates between Lancaster and Santa Barbara. At Loyola, he is honoured by the Ninian Smart Award for Excellence in Religious Studies. In April 2001, the Santa Barbara Templeton Research Lecture series was dedicated to the memory of Smart, and a commemorative plaque was presented to the Smart family. He had been due to deliver a Templeton lecture himself.

==Personal life==
Smart married [[Libushka Baruffaldi]] in 1954. Their children were Roderick, Luisabel, Caroline and Peregrine. Smart had eight grandchildren at the time of his death.

Libushka was originally from [[Lake Como]], [[Italy]], where Smart regularly spent his summer vacations at his family home. Ninian and Libushka were the first from the Western academy to have their marriage blessed by [[Sun Myung Moon]] and [[Hak Ja Han|Mrs. Moon]] in August 1992.

Towards the end of his life, Smart described himself as a "Buddhist-[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]", saying, "No religion, it seems to me, contains the whole truth. I think it's mad to think that there is nothing to learn from other traditions and civilizations. If you accept that other religions have something to offer and you learn from them, that is what you become: a Buddhist-Episcopalian or a Hindu-Muslim or whatever".&lt;ref name="London"/&gt;

'''Perception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''perceptio'') is the organization, identification, and interpretation of [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher = Worth Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All perception involves signals that go through the [[nervous system]], which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"&gt;Goldstein (2009) pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, vision involves [[photon|light]] striking the [[retina]] of the [[eye]], smell is mediated by [[Olfactory system#Peripheral|odor molecules]], and [[hearing]] involves [[sound wave|pressure waves]].

Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]], and [[attention]].&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010" /&gt;

Perception can be split into two processes, &lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Douglas A. |title = Essentials of Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=5 March 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-90693-3 |pages=123–124 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170102091148/https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) processing the sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition), (2) processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as [[attention]]) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. &lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;

Since the rise of [[experimental psychology]] in the 19th century, [[perceptual psychology|psychology's understanding of perception]] has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="mind_perception"&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard]]. "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp.&amp;nbsp;598–601.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychophysics]] quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]]. Elemente der Psychophysik. Leipzig 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensory neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied [[computation]]ally, in terms of the information they process. [[Philosophy of perception|Perceptual issues in philosophy]] include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

Although the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of [[illusion]]s and [[ambiguous image]]s has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt; There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of [[hypothesis]] testing, analogous to [[science]], or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

The [[perceptual system]]s of the [[brain]] enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a [[cognitive module|modular way]], with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of [[Sensory Maps|sensory maps]], mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, [[taste]] is strongly influenced by smell.&lt;ref name="DeVereCalvert2010_33" /&gt;

== Process and terminology ==
&lt;!-- linked from disambiguation: update or define {{Anchor|Process and terminology}} if changed --&gt;
The process of perception begins with an object in the real world, termed the ''distal stimulus'' or ''distal object''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; By means of light, sound or another physical process, the object stimulates the body's sensory organs. These sensory organs transform the input energy into neural activity—a process called ''transduction''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pomerantz" /&gt; This raw pattern of neural activity is called the ''proximal stimulus''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; These neural signals are transmitted to the brain and processed.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt; The resulting mental re-creation of the distal stimulus is the ''percept''.

An example would be a shoe. The shoe itself is the distal stimulus. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates the retina, that stimulation is the proximal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |title = Sensation and Perception |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510081956/http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |archivedate = 10 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the shoe reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept. Another example would be a telephone ringing. The ringing of the telephone is the distal stimulus. The sound stimulating a person's auditory receptors is the proximal stimulus, and the brain's interpretation of this as the ringing of a telephone is the percept. The different kinds of sensation such as warmth, sound, and taste are called ''[[stimulus modality|sensory modalities]]''.&lt;ref name="pomerantz"&gt;Pomerantz, James R. (2003): "Perception: Overview". In: Lynn Nadel (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, London: Nature Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;527–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillisCoggeshall2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=William D. |last2=Coggeshall |first2=Richard E. |title=Sensory Mechanisms of the Spinal Cord: Primary afferent neurons and the spinal dorsal horn |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=31 January 2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-306-48033-1 |page = 1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162356/http://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Jerome Bruner]] has developed a model of perception. According to him, people go through the following process to form opinions:&lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan S. &amp; Gary J. (2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are open to different informational cues and want to learn more about the target.
# In the second step, we try to collect more information about the target. Gradually, we encounter some familiar cues which help us categorize the target.
# At this stage, the cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.

According to [[Alan Saks]] and [[Gary Johns]], there are three components to perception.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;

# The Perceiver, the person who becomes aware about something and comes to a final understanding. There are 3 factors that can influence his or her perceptions: experience, motivational state and finally emotional state. In different motivational or emotional states, the perceiver will react to or perceive something in different ways. Also in different situations he or she might employ a "perceptual defence" where they tend to "see what they want to see".
# The Target. This is the person who is being perceived or judged. "Ambiguity or lack of information about a target leads to a greater need for interpretation and addition."
# The Situation also greatly influences perceptions because different situations may call for additional information about the target.

Stimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may be translated into multiple percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in what is called ''[[multistable perception]]''. And the same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. Ambiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept; for example the [[Rubin vase]] which can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. "'''Percept'''" is also a term used by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz' ''Monadology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bergson]], [[Deleuze]], and [[Guattari]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari's ''What is Philosophy?''&lt;/ref&gt; to define perception independent from perceivers.

==Reality==
In the case of visual perception, some people can actually see the percept shift in their [[mind's eye]].&lt;ref name=Wettlaufer2003&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wettlaufer | first = Alexandra K. | year = 2003 | title = In the mind's eye : the visual impulse in Diderot, Baudelaire and Ruskin, pg. 257 | isbn = 90-420-1035-5 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who are not [[Picture thinking|picture thinkers]], may not necessarily perceive the 'shape-shifting' as their world changes. The 'esemplastic' nature has been shown by experiment: an [[ambiguous image]] has multiple interpretations on the perceptual level.

This confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as [[camouflage]], and also in biological [[mimicry]], for example by [[European peacock|European peacock butterflies]], whose wings bear [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator.

There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight "delay", to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 The Secret Advantage Of Being Short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521081301/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 |date=21 May 2009 }} by Robert Krulwich. ''All Things Considered'', NPR. 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] – which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference – and [[Weber-Fechner law|Fechner's law]] which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (for example, testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] school of psychology, with its emphasis on [[Holism|holistic]] approach.

===Constancy===
{{main article|Subjective constancy|}}
''Perceptual constancy'' is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}}&lt;ref name="AtkinsonAtkinson1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rita L.|last2=Atkinson|first2=Richard C.|last3=Smith|first3=Edward E.|title=Introduction to psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=March 1990|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-543689-3|pages=177–183|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162907/http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individual people can be recognized from views, such as frontal and profile, which form very different shapes on the retina. A coin looked at face-on makes a circular image on the retina, but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt; In normal perception these are recognized as a single three-dimensional object. Without this correction process, an animal approaching from the distance would appear to gain in size.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonderegger |first=Theo |title = Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=16 October 1998 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8220-5327-9 |pages=43–46 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162741/http://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; One kind of perceptual constancy is ''[[color constancy]]'': for example, a white piece of paper can be recognized as such under different colors and intensities of light.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein|first=E.

The brain compensates for this, so the speed of contact does not affect the perceived roughness.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; Other constancies include melody, odor, brightness and words.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roeckelein |first=Jon E. |title = Elsevier's dictionary of psychological theories |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA126 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-51750-0 |page=126 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162549/http://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA126 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These constancies are not always total, but the variation in the percept is much less than the variation in the physical stimulus.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; The perceptual systems of the brain achieve perceptual constancy in a variety of ways, each specialized for the kind of information being processed&lt;ref name="Yantis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yantis|first=Steven|title=Visual perception: essential readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpGvYSTk9gYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-598-7|page=7|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162254/http://books.google.com/books?id=GpGvYSTk9gYC&amp;pg=PA7|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[phonemic restoration effect|phonemic restoration]] as a notable example from hearing.

===Grouping===
{{main article|Principles of grouping}}

[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of Closure. The human brain tends to perceive complete shapes even if those forms are incomplete.]]

The ''principles of grouping'' (or ''Gestalt laws of grouping'') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to [[perceive]] patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]: ''proximity, similarity, closure, good continuation, common fate'' and ''good form''.

The principle of ''proximity'' states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. The principle of ''similarity'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[visual]] texture and resemblance. The principle of ''closure'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of ''good continuation'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of ''common fate'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured.

===Contrast effects===
{{main article|Contrast effect}}

A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context. If one object is extreme on some dimension, then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme. "Simultaneous contrast effect" is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time, whereas "successive contrast" applies when stimuli are presented one after another.&lt;ref name="Corsini2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=The dictionary of psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-58391-328-4|page=219|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162655/http://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast effect was noted by the 17th Century philosopher [[John Locke]], who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold, depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=Laura H. |title=Contrast in judgments of mental health |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-91314-6 |page=1 |deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163219/http://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008" /&gt; These effects shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including how heavy an object feels.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plous|first=Scott|title=The psychology of judgment and decision making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050477-6|pages=38–41|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162735/http://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment found that thinking of the name "Hitler" led to subjects rating a person as more hostile.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B.|title=Social cognition: understanding self and others |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2 |page=421|deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163155/http://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was pleasant or unpleasant.&lt;ref name="Popper2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Arthur N.|title=Music Perception |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=30 November 2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-6113-6 |page=150 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163046/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem smaller when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"/&gt; In the brain, brightness contrast exerts effects on both neuronal firing rates and neuronal synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biederlack|first1=J.|first2=M.|last2=Castelo-Branco |first3=S.|last3=Neuenschwander|first4=D.W.|last4=Wheeler|first5= W.|last5=Singer|first6=D.|last6=Nikolić |year=2006 |title=Brightness induction: Rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |pages=1073–1083 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.012 |pmid=17178409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of experience==
{{main article|Perceptual learning}}

With experience, [[organism]]s can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions, and learn new kinds of categorization. Wine-tasting, the reading of X-ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the [[human]] sphere. [[Research]] has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of [[learning]], and whether it takes place in peripheral [[sensory perception|sensory]] systems or in the brain's processing of sense information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sumner|first=Meghan|title=The Effect of Experience on the Perception and Representation of Dialect Variants|work=Journal of Memory and Language|publisher=Elsevier Inc., 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url = http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202011511/http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Empirical]] [[research]] show that specific practices (such as [[yoga]], [[mindfulness]], [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]], [[meditation]], Daoshi and other mind-body disciplines) can modify human perceptual modality. Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception]]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiori| first1=Francesca |last2=David|first2=Nicole |last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |date=2014|volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=537&amp;name=human_neuroscience&amp;ART_DOI=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of motivation and expectation==
{{main article|Set (psychology)}}
A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of how perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"/&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J.

They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"/&gt;

Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience is more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of [[playing cards]] reversed the color of the [[Suit (cards)|suit]] symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).&lt;ref&gt;"On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm" by Jerome S. Bruner and Leo Postman. ''Journal of Personality'', 18, pp. 206-223. 1949. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Bruner/Cards/ Yorku.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215174339/http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Bruner/Cards/ |date=15 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] explains that perception, although it occurs quickly, is not simply a bottom-up process (where minute details are put together to form larger wholes). Instead, our brains use what he calls '[[predictive coding]]'. It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world, and as expectations are met, it makes more detailed predictions (errors lead to new predictions, or [[learning]] processes). Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely "unbiased, unfiltered" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title= Predictive Coding|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate= 5 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.

==Theories==

===Perception as direct perception===
[[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive theories]] of perception assume there is a poverty of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. This (with reference to perception) is the claim that [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] are, by themselves, unable to provide a unique description of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, James V. (2012): "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HZf6AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vision and Brain: How we perceive the world]", Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 155-178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensations require 'enriching', which is the role of the mental model. A different type of theory is the perceptual [[Ecological psychology|ecology]] approach of [[James J. Gibson]]. Gibson rejected the assumption of a [[poverty of stimulus]] by rejecting the notion that perception is based upon sensations&amp;nbsp;– instead, he investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems. His theory "assumes the existence of stable, unbounded, and permanent stimulus-information in the [[ambient optic array]]. And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (2002): "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f594/23f1a766380ff945fc401b976618a2b2a92a.pdf A Theory of Direct Visual Perception]". In: Alva Noë/Evan Thompson (Eds.), ''Vision and Mind. Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'', Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the psychologists who work within this [[paradigm]] detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile, exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|title=Phenomenology of the Human Person|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521717663|pages=199–200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925011659/https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Specification" would be a 1:1 mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array; given such a mapping, no enrichment is required and perception is [[direct perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Robert J.|title=James Gibson's Passive Theory of Perception: A Rejection of the Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energies|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=December 1976|volume=37|issue=2|pages=218–233|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|doi=10.2307/2107193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613180128/http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception-in-action===
An ecological understanding of perception derived from Gibson's early work is that of "perception-in-action", the notion that perception is a requisite property of animate action; that without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, and perception and movement can be described as "two sides of the same coin, the coin is action". Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls "invariants", already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is to home in upon them. A view known as [[Constructive perception|constructivism]] (held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]) regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the "entity", which is therefore far from being invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasersfeld considers an "invariant" as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not and need not represent an actuality, and Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.) (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_EsHHxHYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Certainty of Uncertainty: Dialogues Introducing Constructivism],'' Exeter: Imprint Academic; Wright. Edmond (2005). ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the [[General Tau Theory]]. According to this theory, tau information, or time-to-goal information is the fundamental 'percept' in perception.

===Evolutionary psychology (EP) and perception===
Many philosophers, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 4, pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prospagnosia).&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

===Closed-loop perception===
Here perception is proposed to be a dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops&lt;ref name="Dewey1"&gt; Dewey, J.

==Physiology==
{{main article|Sensory system}}
A ''sensory system'' is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing [[sense|sensory]] information. A sensory system consists of [[sensory receptor]]s, [[neural pathway]]s, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for [[vision (sense)|vision]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[somatic sensation]] (touch), [[taste]] and [[olfaction]] (smell). It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bedford|first=F. L. | year = 2011 | title = The missing sensory modality: the immune system | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 1265–1267 | doi = 10.1068/p7119|pmid=22308900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, senses are [[transducers]] from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The [[receptive field]] is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]] can see, is its receptive field.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Receptive fields have been identified for the [[visual system]], [[auditory system]] and [[somatosensory system]], so far.
Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to "Interoception", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism’s well being and survival. Interoception is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation. Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals, history, and environment, shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farb N. |author2=Daubenmier J. |author3=Price C.

==Types==

===Vision===
{{main article|Visual perception}}

In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina | first1=Tim|last1=Gollisch|first2=Markus|last2=Meister | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages=150–164 | date= 28 January 2010 | journal = Neuron | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009| pmid=20152123| pmc=3717333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated in this image)]]
{{main article|Hearing (sense)}}
Hearing (or ''audition'') is the ability to perceive [[sound]] by detecting [[vibration]]s. Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|audio]] or ''sonic''. The range is typically considered to be between 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | title = Frequency Range of Human Hearing | work = The Physics Factbook | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | archivedate = 21 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[infrasound|infrasonic]]. The [[auditory system]] includes the [[ear|outer ears]] which collect and filter sound waves, the [[ear|middle ear]] for transforming the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]), and the [[ear|inner ear]] which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, which is where the auditory information arrives in the [[cerebral cortex]] and is further processed there.

Sound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are superimposed as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out the sources of interest, often estimating their distance and direction as well as identifying them.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt;

===Touch===
{{main article|Haptic perception}}

''Haptic perception'' is the process of recognizing objects through touch. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V. A. |year=1985 |title=Identifying objects by touch: An "expert system." |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |issue = 4 |pages=299–302 |doi=10.3758/BF03211351 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lederman|first1=S. J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=R. L. |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9 |volume=19 |pmid=3608405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref name=Robles-de-la-torre2001&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Robles-de-la-torre | first1 = Gabriel | last2 = Hayward | first2 = Vincent | year = 2001 | title = Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch | journal = Nature | pmid = 11473320 | volume = 412 | issue = 6845 | pages = 445–448 | doi = 10.1038/35086588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson defined the haptic system as "The sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and others emphasized the close link between haptic perception and body movement: haptic perception is active exploration. The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]] according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

===Taste===
{{main article|Taste}}

Taste (or, the more formal term, ''gustation'') is the ability to perceive the [[flavor]] of substances including, but not limited to, [[food]]. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called ''[[taste bud]]s'', or ''gustatory calyculi'', concentrated on the upper surface of the [[tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 Human biology (Page 201/464)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102150409/https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 |date=2 January 2017 }} Daniel D.

===Social===
{{main article|Social perception}}
''Social perception'' is the part of perception that allows people to understand the individuals and groups of their social world, and thus an element of [[social cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith, D. M. Mackie (2000). ''Social Psychology''. Psychology Press, 2nd ed., p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech====
{{main article|Speech perception}}
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|right|thumb|Though the phrase "I owe you" can be heard as three distinct words, a [[spectrogram]] reveals no clear boundaries.]]
''Speech perception'' is the process by which spoken languages are heard, interpreted and understood. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. The sound of a word can vary widely according to words around it and the tempo of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and mood of the speaker. Listeners manage to perceive words across this wide range of different conditions. Another variation is that [[reverberation]] can make a large difference in sound between a word spoken from the far side of a room and the same word spoken up close. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian C.

The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of [[Hearing (sense)|audition]]. The initial auditory signal is compared with visual information — primarily lip movement — to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. It is possible other sensory modalities are integrated at this stage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Lawrence D.|last=Rosenblum | editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Pisoni|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Remez | chapter = Primacy of Multimodal Speech Perception | page = 51 | title = The Handbook of Speech Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EwY15naRiFgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Primacy+of+Multimodal+Speech+Perception%22&amp;ots=0OZ7x69V2R&amp;sig=EqQJlEfphDzrJA32aI1DD4Ku50I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Primacy%20of%20Multimodal%20Speech%20Perception%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

Speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. That is, higher-level language processes connected with [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]] may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It may be the case that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. In one experiment, Richard M. Warren replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty and what is more, they were not able to identify accurately which phoneme had been disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren|first=R. M. |year=1970 |title=Restoration of missing speech sounds |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages=392–393 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3917.392 |pmid=5409744 |issue=3917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faces====
{{main article|Face perception}}
''Facial perception'' refers to cognitive processes specialized for handling human faces, including perceiving the identity of an individual, and facial expressions such as emotional cues.

====Social touch====
{{main article | Somatosensory system#Neural processing of social touch}}
The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. [[Affective touch]] is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex, but the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood oxygen level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27225773 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1130-15.2016 | pmc=4879201 | volume=36 | title=Encoding of Touch Intensity But Not Pleasantness in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex | journal=J Neurosci | pages=5850–60 | last1 = Case | first1 = LK | last2 = Laubacher | first2 = CM | last3 = Olausson | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = B | last5 = Spagnolo | first5 = PA | last6 = Bushnell | first6 = MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other senses===
{{main article|Sense}}
Other senses enable perception of body balance, acceleration, gravity, position of body parts, temperature, pain, time, and perception of internal senses such as suffocation, gag reflex, intestinal distension, fullness of rectum and urinary bladder, and sensations felt in the throat and lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5136">In computing, especially [[computational geometry]], a '''real RAM''' ([[random access machine]]) is a mathematical model of a computer that can compute with exact [[real number]]s instead of the binary numbers used by most actual computers.
The real RAM was formulated by [[Michael Ian Shamos]] in his 1978 Ph.D. dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael Ian|last=Shamos|authorlink=Michael Ian Shamos|year=1978|title=Computational Geometry|publisher=Yale University|series=Ph.D. dissertation}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The "RAM" part of the real RAM model name stands for "[[random access machine]]". This is a model of computing that resembles a simplified version of a standard computer architecture. It consists of a [[stored program]], a [[computer memory]] unit consisting of an array of cells, and a [[central processing unit]] with a bounded number of [[Processor register|registers]]. Each memory cell or register can store a real number. Under the control of the program, the real RAM can transfer real numbers between memory and registers, and perform arithmetic operations on the values stored in the registers.

The allowed operations typically include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as comparisons, but not modulus or rounding to integers. The reason for avoiding integer rounding and modulus operations is that allowing these operations could give the real RAM unreasonable amounts of computational power, enabling it to solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

When analyzing algorithms for the real RAM, each allowed operation is typically assumed to take [[constant time]].

==Implementation==
[[Software library|Software libraries]] such as [[Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms|LEDA]] have been developed which allow programmers to write computer programs that work as if they were running on a real RAM.
These libraries represent real values using [[data structure]]s which allow them to perform arithmetic and comparisons with the same results as a real RAM would produce. The time analysis of the underlying real RAM algorithm
can be interpreted as counting the number of library calls needed by a given algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The real RAM closely resembles the later  [[Blum–Shub–Smale machine]], which however lacks the memory unit that gives the real RAM the "RAM" part of its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Blum | first1=Lenore | author1-link=Lenore Blum | last2=Shub | first2=Mike | author2-link=Michael Shub | last3=Smale | first3=Steve | author3-link=Stephen Smale | zbl=0681.03020 | pages=1–46 | doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1989-15750-9 | year=1989|title=On a theory of computation and complexity over the real numbers: NP-completeness, recursive functions and universal machines|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=21|issue=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the real RAM is typically used for the analysis of concrete algorithms in [[computational geometry]], while the Blum–Shub–Smale machine instead forms the basis for extensions of the theory of [[NP-completeness]] to real-number computation.

An alternative to the real RAM is the [[word RAM]], in which both the inputs to a problem and the values stored in memory and registers are assumed to be integers with a fixed number of bits. The word RAM model can perform some operations more quickly than the real RAM; for instance, it allows fast [[integer sorting]] algorithms, while sorting on the real RAM must be done with slower [[comparison sort]]ing algorithms. However, some computational geometry problems have inputs or outputs that cannot be represented exactly using integer coordinates; see for instance the [[Perles configuration]], an arrangement of points and line segments that has no integer-coordinate representation.

The '''safety testing of explosives''' involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and 
safety in use.

It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of [[explosives]]. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, [[PETN]] is considered to be a [[primary explosive]] by some individuals, and a [[secondary explosive]] by others. As a general rule, PETN is considered to be either a relatively insensitive primary explosive, or one of the most sensitive secondary explosives. PETN may be detonated by striking with a hammer on a hard steel surface (a very dangerous thing to do), and is generally considered the least sensitive explosive with which this may be done. For these facts and other reasons, PETN is considered one standard by which other explosives are gauged.

Another explosive that is used as a calibration standard is [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], which was afforded the arbitrary [[Figure of Insensitivity]] of 100. Other explosives could then be compared against this standard.

==Types of safety testing==
Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives:

* Impact testing. The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is released, impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the [[Bruceton analysis]] and [[Neyer d-optimal test]]. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will "go"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells.
* Friction testing. There are several techniques through which explosives may be tested to determine their sensitivity to friction. One of the most popular is the ABL friction test, which uses a line of explosives on a prepared metal plate, placed in front of a specially prepared metal wheel that is forced down upon the plate with a hydraulic press. The metal plate is then struck with a pendulum to move it, squeezing the explosives between plate and wheel as the plate moves. Initiation is determined, and analyzed by the [[Bruceton analysis]] or [[Neyer d-optimal test]], as above. BAM friction testing is similar, except that the sample is placed on a ceramic plate which is then moved side-to-side as a ceramic peg exerts force on the sample.
* [[Electrostatic discharge]]. Testing for ESD, or [[electric spark|"spark"]] sensitivity of explosives is performed with a machine designed to discharge from a capacitor through a prepared sample. The [[Sandia National Labs]] design employs a dipping needle that punctures a sample cell and discharges the spark simultaneously. The amount of energy discharged into the cell becomes the variable in which [[Bruceton analysis]] or [[Neyer d-optimal test]] is performed to determine spark sensitivity.
* [[Thermal sensitivity]]. Determining the point at which a compound is capable of detonating under confinement with thermal stress is useful. A fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world.  Thermal safety testing may also be performed via [[differential scanning calorimetry]], in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the [[melting point]], [[phase transition]]s and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined.

Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that these figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.

== Fireworks ==

A '''satellite system''' is a set of gravitationally bound objects in orbit around a [[planetary mass object]] or [[minor planet]]. Generally speaking, it is a set of [[natural satellites]] (moons), although such systems may also consist of bodies such as circumplanetary disks, [[Planetary ring|ring systems]], [[moonlet]]s, [[minor-planet moon]]s and [[artificial satellites]] any of which may themselves have satellite systems of their own. Some bodies also possess [[quasi-satellite]]s that have orbits gravitationally influenced by their primary, but are generally not considered to be part of a satellite system. Satellite systems can have complex interactions including magnetic, tidal, atmospheric and orbital interactions such as [[orbital resonance]]s and [[libration]].  Individually major satellite objects are designated in Roman numerals.  Satellite systems are referred to either by the possessive adjectives of their primary (e.g. "Jovian system"), or less commonly by the name of their primary (e.g. "Jupiter system").  Where only one satellite is known, or it is a binary orbiting a common centre of gravity, it may be referred to using the hyphenated names of the primary and major satellite (e.g. the "Earth-Moon system").

Many Solar System objects are known to possess satellite systems, though their origin is still unclear.  Notable examples include the largest satellite system, the Jovian system, with [[Moons of Jupiter|79 known moons]]&lt;ref name="shep-main"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sheppard |first=Scott S. |title=The Jupiter Satellite and Moon Page |url=https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/moons |website=[[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism]] |access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including the large [[Galilean moons]])  and the Saturnian System with [[Moons of Saturn|62 known moons]] (and the most visible ring system in the Solar System).  Both satellite systems are large and diverse.  In fact all of the giant planets of the Solar System possess large satellite systems as well as planetary rings, and it is inferred that this is a general pattern.  Several objects farther from the Sun also have satellite systems consisting of multiple moons, including the complex Plutonian system where multiple objects orbit a common [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|center of mass]], as well as many asteroids and plutinos.  Apart from the Earth-Moon system and Mars' system of two tiny natural satellites, the other terrestrial planets are generally not considered satellite systems, although some have been orbited by artificial satellites originating from Earth.

Little is known of satellite systems beyond the Solar System, although it is inferred that natural satellites are common. [[J1407b]] is an example of an extrasolar satellite system.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthew A. Kenworthy, Eric E. Mamajek |title=Modeling giant extrasolar ring systems in eclipse and the case of J1407b: sculpting by exomoons?|arxiv=1501.05652|date=2015-01-22 |language=en |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/126 |volume=800 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=126 |bibcode=2015ApJ...800..126K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also theorised that [[Rogue planet]]s ejected from their planetary system could retain a system of satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0945 The Survival Rate of Ejected Terrestrial Planets with Moons] by J. H. Debes, S. Sigurdsson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural formation and evolution==
Satellite systems, like planetary systems, are the product of gravitational attraction, but are also sustained through [[fictitious force]]s.  While the general consensus is that most planetary systems are formed from an accretionary disks, the formation of satellite systems is less clear.  The origin of many moons are investigated on a case by case basis, and the larger systems are thought to have formed through a combination of one or more processes.

===System stability===
[[File:L4 diagram.svg|thumb|right|200px|Gravitational accelerations at {{L4|nolink=yes}}]]
The [[Hill sphere]] is the region in which an astronomical body dominates the attraction of satellites. Of the Solar System planets, Neptune and Uranus have the largest Hill spheres, due to the lessened gravitational influence of the Sun at their far orbits, however all of the giant planets have Hill spheres in the vicinity of 100 million kilometres in radius. By contrast, the Hill spheres of Mercury and Ceres, being closer to the Sun are quite small.  Outside of the Hill sphere, the Sun dominates the gravitational influence, with the exception of the [[Lagrangian point]]s.

Satellites are stable at the {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}} Lagrangian points.  These lie at the third corners of the two [[equilateral triangle]]s in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses, such that the point lies behind ({{L5|nolink=yes}}) or ahead ({{L4|nolink=yes}}) of the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass.   The triangular points ({{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}}) are stable equilibria, provided that the ratio of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than 24.96.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&lt;big&gt;Actually &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{25+\sqrt{621}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ≈ 24.9599357944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf |title=''[http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf The Lagrange Points]'' }}''[http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf The Lagrange Points]'', Neil J. Cornish with input from Jeremy Goodman&lt;/ref&gt; When a body at these points is perturbed, it moves away from the point, but the factor opposite of that which is increased or decreased by the perturbation (either gravity or angular momentum-induced speed) will also increase or decrease, bending the object's path into a stable, [[Common bean#Red or kidney beans|kidney-bean]]-shaped orbit around the point (as seen in the corotating frame of reference).

It is generally thought that natural satellites should orbit in the same direction as the planet is rotating (known as prograde orbit).  As such, the terminology [[regular moon]] is used for these orbit.  However a retrograde orbit (the opposite direction to the planet) is also possible, the terminology [[irregular moon]] is used to describe known exceptions to the rule, it is believed that irregular moons have been inserted into orbit through gravitational capture.&lt;ref name="Academic Press"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Accretion theories===
Accretion disks around giant planets may occur in a similar way to the occurrence of disks around stars, out of which planets form (for example, this is one of the theories for the formations of the satellite systems of Uranus,&lt;ref name="Mousis 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20031515|bibcode=2004A&amp;A...413..373M|pages=373&amp;ndash;380 |volume=413 | first=O.|title=Modeling the thermodynamical conditions in the Uranian subnebula – Implications for regular satellite composition|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|last=Mousis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn, and Jupiter). This early cloud of gas is a type of circumplanetary disk&lt;ref name=dangelo_podolak_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Podolak, M. |title=Capture and Evolution of Planetesimals in Circumjovian Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=806|issue=1|pages=29pp|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/203|arxiv = 1504.04364 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..203D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardCanup2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=William R.|last2=Canup|first2=Robin M.|title=CIRCUMPLANETARY DISK FORMATION|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=140|issue=5|year=2010|pages=1168–1193|issn=0004-6256|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/140/5/1168|bibcode=2010AJ....140.1168W}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as a proto-satellite disk (in the case of the Earth-Moon system, the proto-lunar disk). Models of gas during the formation of planets coincide with a general rule for planet-to-satellite(s) mass ratio of 10,000:1&lt;ref&gt;Bate et al 2003 (Monthly Notices of RSA, vol. 341, pp. 213-229)&lt;/ref&gt; (a notable exception is Neptune).  Accretion is also proposed by some as a theory for the origin of the Earth-Moon system,&lt;ref name="burro.cwru.edu"&gt;http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/lunaform.html&lt;/ref&gt; however the angular momentum of system and the Moon's smaller iron core can not easily be explained by this.&lt;ref name="burro.cwru.edu"/&gt;

====Debris disks====
Another proposed mechanism for satellite system formation is accretion from debris.  Scientists theorise that the Galilean moons are thought by some to be a more recent generation of moons formed from the disintegration of earlier generations of accreted moons.&lt;ref name="newsci"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126984.300-cannibalistic-jupiter-ate-its-early-moons.html|title=Cannibalistic Jupiter ate its early moons|last=Chown|first=Marcus|date=7 March 2009|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ring systems are a type of circumplanetary disk that can be the result of satellites disintegrated near the [[Roche limit]].  Such disks could, over time, coalesce to form natural satellites.

===Collision theories===
{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
[[File:Creation of the moons of Pluto.jpg|thumb|Formation of Pluto's moons. 1: a [[Kuiper belt object]] nears [[Pluto]]; 2: the KBO impacts Pluto; 3: a [[dust ring]] forms around Pluto; 4: the [[debris]] aggregates to form Charon; 5: Pluto and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] relax into spherical bodies.]]
Collision is one of the leading theories for the formation of satellite systems, particularly those of the Earth and Pluto. Objects in such a system may be part of a [[collisional family]] and this origin may be verified comparing their [[orbital elements]] and composition.  Computer simulations have been used to demonstrate that [[giant impact]]s could have been the [[origin of the Moon]].  It is thought that early Earth had multiple moons resulting from the giant impact. Similar models have been used to explain the creation of the Plutonian system as well as those of other [[Kuiper belt object]]s and asteroids.

====Temporary capture====
Evidence for the natural process of satellite capture has been found in direct observation of objects captured by Jupiter.  Five such captures have been observed, the longest being for approximately twelve years. Based on computer modelling, the future capture of comet [[111P/Helin-Roman-Crockett]] for 18 years is predicted to begin in 2068.&lt;ref name="Ohtsukaetal2008"&gt;{{cite journal

===Controversial theories===
Some controversial early theories, for example [[Spaceship Moon Theory]] and Shklovsky's "Hollow Phobos" hypothesis have suggested that moons were not formed naturally at all. These theories tend to fail [[Occam's razor]]. While artificial satellites are now a common occurrence in the Solar System, the largest, the [[International Space Station]] is 108.5 metres at its widest, is tiny compared to the several kilometres of the smallest natural satellites.

==Features and interactions==
Natural satellite systems, particularly those involving multiple planetary mass objects can have complex interactions which can have effects on multiple bodies or across the wider system.

===Ring systems===
{{Main|Ring system}}
[[Image:R08 satorb full.jpg|thumb|right|Model for formation of Jupiter's rings]]
Ring systems are collections of [[cosmic dust|dust]], [[moonlet]]s, or other small objects. The most notable examples are [[Rings of Saturn|those around Saturn]], but the other three [[gas giant]]s ([[Rings of Jupiter|Jupiter]], [[Rings of Uranus|Uranus]] and [[Rings of Neptune|Neptune]]) also have ring systems. Studies of exoplanets indicate that they may be common around giant planets. The 90 million km (0.6 [[astronomical unit|AU]] circumplanetary ring system discovered around [[J1407b]] has been described as "[[Saturn]] on steroids"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.discovery.com/space/saturn-on-steroids-exoplanet-discovered-120111.htm | first=Ian | last=O'Neill | title='Saturn on Steroids' Exoplanet Discovered? | work=[[Discovery News]] | date=January 12, 2012 | accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or “[[Super Saturn]]”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/gigantic-ring-system-around-j1407b/ Gigantic ring system around J1407b much larger, heavier than Saturn’s], on ''University of Rochester'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenworthy" /&gt; Luminosity studies suggest that an even larger disk exists in the [[PDS 110]] system.&lt;ref name=osborn&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1705.10346 |title=Periodic Eclipses of the Young Star PDS 110 Discovered with WASP and KELT Photometry |last1=Osborn |first1=H.

Most rings were thought to be unstable and to dissipate over the course of tens or hundreds of millions of years. Studies of Saturn's rings however indicate that they may date to the early days of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 12, 2007|title=Saturn's Rings May Be Old Timers|publisher=NASA (News Release 2007-149)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini20071212.html|accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current theories suggest that some ring systems may form in repeating cycles, accreting into natural satellites that break up as soon as they reach the Roche limit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2132906-saturns-moons-could-reassemble-after-a-cosmic-smash-up/&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been used to explain the longevity of Saturn's rings as well the moons of Mars.

An exception is Earth's moon, which orbits in to the planet's [[equatorial plane]].&lt;ref name="Beletskii2"&gt;{{cite book |author=V V Belet︠s︡kiĭ |title=Essays on the Motion of Celestial Bodies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byWZusmVSecC |date=2001 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-7643-5866-2 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other is known as orbital resonance.  Orbital resonances are present in several satellite systems: 
* 2:4 [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]]–[[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] (Saturn’s moons)
* 1:2 [[Dione (moon)|Dione]]–[[Enceladus]] (Saturn’s moons)
* 3:4 [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]–[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (Saturn's moons)
* 1:2:4 [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]–[[Europa (moon)|Europa]]–[[Io (moon)|Io]] (Jupiter’s moons)
* 1:3:4:5:6 near resonances - [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] (Pluto's moons) (Styx approximately 5.4% from resonance, Nix approximately 2.7%, Kerberos approximately 0.6%, and Hydra approximately 0.3%).&lt;ref name="Matson"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible orbital interactions include libration and co-orbital configuration. The Saturnian moons Janus and Epimetheus share their orbits, the difference in semi-major axes being less than either's mean diameter. Libration is a perceived oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other.  The Earth-moon satellite system is known to produce this effect.

Several systems are known to orbit a common centre of mass and are known as binary companions.  The most notable system is the Plutonian system, which is also dwarf planet binary.  Several minor planets also share this configuration, including "true binaries" with near equal mass, such as [[90 Antiope]] and [[(66063) 1998 RO1]].  Some orbital interactions and binary configurations have been found to cause smaller moons to take non-spherical forms and "tumble" chaotically rather than rotate, as in the case of Nix, Hydra (moons of Pluto) and [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] (moon of Saturn).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/29559-pluto-moons-weird-orbit-chaos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tidal interaction====
[[Image:Tidal braking.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the [[Earth–Moon system]] showing how the tidal bulge is pushed ahead by [[Earth]]'s rotation. This offset bulge exerts a net torque on the [[Moon]], boosting it while slowing Earth's rotation.]]
Tidal energy including tidal acceleration can have effects on both the primary and satellites. The Moon's tidal forces deform the Earth and hydrosphere, similarly heat generated from tidal friction on the moons of other planets is found to be responsible for their geologically active features. Another extreme example of physical deformity is the massive [[equatorial ridge]] of the asteroid [[(66391) 1999 KW4]] created by the tidal forces of its moon, such deformities may be common among near-Earth asteroids.&lt;ref name="OstroMargot2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostro|first1=Steven. J.|last2=Margot|first2=J.-L.|last3=Benner|first3=L. A. M.|last4=Giorgini|first4=J. D.|last5=Scheeres|first5=D. J.|last6=Fahnestock|first6=E. G.|last7=Broschart|first7=S.

Tidal interactions also cause stable orbits to change over time.  For instance, Triton's orbit around Neptune is decaying and 3.6&amp;nbsp;billion years from now, it is predicted that this will cause Triton to pass within Neptune's [[Roche limit]]&lt;ref name="Chyba"&gt;

====Perturbation and instability====

While tidal forces from the primary are common on satellites, most satellite systems remain stable.  [[perturbation (astronomy)|Perturbation]] between satellites can occur, particularly in the early formation, as the gravity of satellites affect each other, and can result in ejection from the system or collisions between satellites or with the primary.  Simulations show that such interactions cause the orbits of the inner moons of the Uranus system to be chaotic and possibly unstable.&lt;ref name="Showalter Lissauer 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1122882| last1 = Showalter| first1 = Mark R.| last2 = Lissauer| first2 = Jack J.| date = 2006-02-17| title = The Second Ring-Moon System of Uranus: Discovery and Dynamics| journal = Science| volume = 311| issue = 5763| pages = 973–977| pmid = 16373533| bibcode = 2006Sci...311..973S| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Io's active can be explained by perturbation from Europa's gravity as their orbits resonate.Perturbation has been suggested as a reason that Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and collective moons as seen in all other known giant planets.&lt;ref name=Naeye2006b&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|date=September 2006|title=How Moon Mass is Maintained|volume=112|first=R.|issue=3|last=Naeye|page=19|bibcode=2006S&amp;T...112c..19N}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory of the Earth-Moon system suggest that a second companion which formed at the same time as the Moon, was perturbed by the Moon early in the system's history, causing it to impact with the Moon.&lt;ref name="JutziAsphaug2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jutzi|first1=M.|last2=Asphaug|first2=E.|title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon|journal=Nature|volume=476|issue=7358|year=2011|pages=69–72|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature10289|pmid=21814278|bibcode = 2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric and magnetic interaction===
{{main|Gas torus}}
[[Image:PIA04433 Jupiter Torus Diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Gas toruses in the Jovian system generated by [[Io (moon)|Io]] (green) and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (blue)]]
Some satellite systems have been known to have gas interactions between objects. Notable examples include the Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto systems. The [[Io plasma torus]] is a transfer of oxygen and sulfur from the tenuous atmosphere of [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] volcanic moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]] and other objects including Jupiter and Europa.  A torus of oxygen and hydrogen produced by [[Saturn|Saturn's]] moon, [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] forms part of the E ring around Saturn.  Nitrogen gas transfer between Pluto and Charon has also been modelled&lt;ref name="TuckerJohnson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=O.J.|last2=Johnson|first2=R.E.|last3=Young|first3=L.A.|title=Gas transfer in the Pluto–Charon system: A Charon atmosphere|journal=Icarus|volume=246|year=2015|pages=291–297|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.05.002|bibcode=2015Icar..246..291T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be observable by the [[New Horizons]] space probe. Similar tori produced by Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (nitrogen) and Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (hydrogen) is predicted.

[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.mod.svg|thumb|left|Image of Jupiter's northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the interaction with Jupiter's natural satellites]]
Complex magnetic interactions have been observed in satellite systems.  Most notably, the interaction of Jupiter's strong magnetic field with those of Ganymede and Io.  Observations suggest that such interactions can cause the stripping of atmospheres from moons and the generation of spectacular auroras.

==History==
[[File:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|200px|thumb|An illustration from [[al-Biruni]]'s astronomical works, explains the different [[phases of the moon]], with respect to the position of the [[sun]].]]
The notion of satellite systems pre-dates history.  The Moon was known by the earliest humans.  The earliest models of astronomy were based around celestial bodies (or a "celestial sphere") orbiting the Earth. This idea was known as [[geocentrism]] (where the Earth is the centre of the universe).  However the geocentric model did not generally accommodate the possibility of celestial objects orbiting other observed planets, such as Venus or Mars.

[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BCE) made observations which may have included the phenomenon of [[tide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the [[Moon]] and by the revolution of the [[Earth]] around an [[Earth]]-[[Moon]] 'center of mass'.

As [[heliocentrism]] (the doctrine that the Sun is the centre of the universe) began to gain in popularity in the 16th century, the focus shifted to planets and the idea of systems of planetary satellites fell out of general favour.  Nevertheless, in some of these models, the Sun and Moon would have been satellites of the Earth.

Nicholas Copernicus published a model in which the Moon orbited around the Earth in the ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), in the year of his death, 1543.

It was not until the discovery of the Galilean moons in either 1609 or 1610 by [[Galileo]], that the first definitive proof was found for celestial bodies orbiting planets.

The first suggestion of a ring system was in 1655, when [[Christiaan Huygens]] thought that Saturn was surrounded by rings.&lt;ref name="ff.saturn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=A. F. O'D. |title=The Planet Saturn |date=1962 |place=London |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |pages=108–109 |doi=10.1002/qj.49708837730 |isbn=0-486-23927-6 |bibcode = 1962QJRMS..88..366D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first probe to explore a satellite system other than Earth was Mariner 7 in 1969, which observed Phobos.  The twin probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were the first to explore the Jovian system in 1979.

==Zones and habitability==
{{See also|Habitability of natural satellites}}
[[File:UpsilonAndromedae D moons.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a moon with surface water oceans orbiting within the circumstellar habitable zone]]
Based on tidal heating models, scientists have defined zones in satellite systems similarly to those of planetary systems.  One such zone is the circumplanetary habitable zone (or "habitable edge"). According to this theory, moons closer to their planet than the habitable edge cannot support liquid water at their surface. When effects of eclipses as well as constraints from a satellite's orbital stability are included into this concept, one finds that — depending on a moon's orbital eccentricity — there is a minimum mass of roughly 0.2 solar masses for stars to host habitable moons within the stellar HZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heller|first=René|title=Exomoon habitability constrained by energy flux and orbital stability|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=September 2012|volume=545|pages=L8|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201220003|arxiv = 1209.0050 |bibcode = 2012A&amp;A...545L...8H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetic environment of exomoons, which is critically triggered by the intrinsic magnetic field of the host planet, has been identified as another effect on exomoon habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heller|first=René|title=Magnetic shielding of exomoons beyond the circumplanetary habitable edge|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=September 2013|arxiv = 1309.0811 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...776L..33H|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/776/2/L33|volume=776|pages=L33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, it was found that moons at distances between about 5 and 20 planetary radii from a giant planet can be habitable from an illumination and tidal heating point of view, but still the planetary magnetosphere would critically influence their habitability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">[[File:Yamnuska bottom cliff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Talus at the bottom of [[Mount Yamnuska]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].]]
'''Scree''' is a collection of broken [[Rock (geology)|rock]] fragments at the base of [[cliff|crag]]s, mountain [[cliff]]s,  [[volcano]]es or [[valley shoulder]]s that has accumulated through periodic [[rockfall]] from adjacent cliff faces. Landforms associated with these materials are often called '''talus deposits'''.  Talus deposits typically have a concave upwards form, while the maximum inclination corresponds to the [[angle of repose]] of the mean [[debris]] size.

The term ''scree'' comes from the [[Old Norse]] term for [[landslide]], ''skriða'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|scree|accessdate=2006-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''talus'' is a French word meaning a slope or embankment.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|talus|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talus|work=bab.la language portal|url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-french/talus|accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Formation ==
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|right|Talus cones on north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]].]]
Formation of scree or talus deposits is the result of physical and chemical [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] acting on a rock face. The predominant processes that degrade a rock slope depend largely on the regional [[climate]] (temperature, amount of rainfall, etc.). Examples are:
* [[Weathering#Physical weathering|Physical weathering]] by ice
* [[Weathering#Chemical weathering|Chemical weathering]] by mineral hydration, dissolution, and salt deposition
* [[Thermal stress]]es
* [[Erosion#Mass_movement|Topographic stresses]]
* [[Biotic component|Biotic]] processes

Scree formation is commonly attributed to the formation of ice within mountain rock slopes. During the day, water can flow into [[Joint (geology)|joints]] and discontinuities in the rock wall. If the temperature drops enough, for example in the evening, this water may freeze. Since water expands by 9% when it freezes, it can generate large forces that either create new cracks or wedge blocks into an unstable position. Special boundary conditions (rapid freezing and water confinement) may be required for this to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=WB|year=1984|chapter=Rockfalls|title=Slope Instability|editor1-last=Brunsden|editor1-first=D.|editor2-last=Prior|editor2-first=DB|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Chichester|pages=217–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frost weathering|Freeze-thaw]] scree production is thought to be most common during the spring and fall, when the daily temperatures fluctuate around the freezing point of water, and snow melt produces ample free water.

The efficiency of freeze/thaw processes in scree production is debated by scientists. Many researchers believe that ice formation in large open crack systems cannot generate high pressures, and instead suggest that the water and ice simply flow out of the cracks as pressure builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=B|year=2006|title=Why do freezing rocks  break?|journal=Science|volume=314|pages=1092–1093|doi=10.1126/science.1135200|pmid=17110559|issue=5802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue that [[frost heaving]], like that known to act in soil in [[permafrost]] areas, may play an important role in cliff degradation in cold places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walder|first1=J|last2=Hallet|first2=B|year=1985|title=A theoretical model of the fracture of rock during freezing|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=96|pages=336–346|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1985)96&lt;336:ATMOTF&gt;2.0.CO;2|issue=3|bibcode = 1985GSAB...96..336W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murton|first1=JB|last2=Peterson|first2=R|last3=Ozouf|first3=J-C|year=2006|title=Bedrock fracture by ice segregation in cold regions|journal=Science|volume=314|pages=1127–1129|doi=10.1126/science.1132127|pmid=17110573|issue=5802|bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1127M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lech dl Dragon bis.JPG|thumb|right|Scree-covered [[glacier]], [[Lech dl Dragon]], [[Italy]] ]]
Scree can conceal a glacier. For example, [[Lech dl Dragon]], in the [[Sella group]] of the [[Dolomites]], derives from the melting waters of a glacier, hidden under a thick layer of scree. The melting process of the underlying glacier is slowed by the protective layer of scree. 

Eventually, a rock slope may be completely covered by its own scree, so that production of new material ceases. The slope is then said to be "mantled" with debris.{{Clear}}

A '''sliding door operator''' (or '''sliding door opener''' or '''automatic sliding door operator''') is a device that operates a [[sliding door]] for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.
[[File:Oorlogsmuseum Overloon.JPG|thumb|Sliding door with opener in a museum]]

== Uses ==
Sliding door operators are typically used on the outside doors of large retail businesses. (smaller retail businesses prefer [[swing door operator]]s.)
They are also used in [[elevator|elevators (lifts)]]

== Triggering ==
A door operator may be triggered in various ways:
* Approach Sensor (such as a [[radar sensor]]) - the door opens when a user approaches it.
* Pushbutton - the door opens when a user presses a button.
* Access control - the door opens when an [[Access control|Access Control System]] determines the user is authorized to go through.
* Automatically (in the case of elevators)
A trigger from any of the above requests that the door be opened (or reopened if it was closing).

== Safety sensors ==
Sensors can be used to detect obstacles in the path of closing doors. The simplest sensor consists of a light beam aimed across the opening: when the beam is broken by an obstacle, the operator prevents the door from closing. [[Infrared]] and [[radar]] safety sensors are also commonly used.

Other sensors such as resistance-sensing motors can be used to reverse the closing action of the door after an obstacle is encountered.

==Technology==
The operator is placed in the space above the sliding door. 

An [[electric motor]], geared down to get a lower speed and a higher [[torque]], drives a [[pulley]] at one end of a belt. The door is clamped to the belt. To open the door, the motor turns the pulley, which in turn turns the belt, which in turn drags the door. To close the door, the reverse occurs.

Historically, elevator doors were opened by a set of mechanical linkages; the motor, geared down, would rotate linked arms, which in turn would drive the door.

==Types==
There are several types of sliding doors, these are:

* Standard sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* Telescopic sliding door (two wings or four wings) 
* Circular sliding door (segment circular, semi-circular or full circular)
* Sliding folding door (two wings or four wings)
* Hermetic sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* All glass sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* [[Clean room]] sliding door (single wing or double wings)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6121">'''Soil and Water Bioengineering''' is a discipline of [[civil engineering]]. It pursues technological, ecological, economic as well as design goals and seeks to achieve these primarily by making use of living materials, i.e. seeds, plants, part of plants and plant communities, and employing them in near–natural constructions while exploiting the manifold abilities inherent in plants.
Soil [[bioengineering]] may sometimes be a substitute for classical engineering works; however, in most cases it is a meaningful and necessary method of complementing the latter.
Its application suggests itself in all fields of soil and [[hydraulic engineering]], especially for [[slope stabilization|slope]] and embankment stabilization and [[erosion control]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H. M. (Trans. N.K. Horstmann, 1980). Bioengineering for Land Reclamation and Conservation. University of Alberta Press. Edmonton. Alberta. 404 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to provide some engineering function. Soil bioengineering is an effective tool for treatment of a variety of unstable and / or eroding sites. Soil bioengineering techniques have been used for many centuries. More recently Schiechtl (1980) has encouraged the use of soil bioengineering with a variety of European examples. Soil bioengineering is now widely practiced throughout the world for the treatment of erosion and unstable slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, D.H. and A.T. Leiser. 1982. Biotechnical Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. Scarborough, Ontario, 271 pp. reprinted by Krieger Publishing Co. Malabar, Florida).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. and J. Hellin. 1996. Bio-engineering for Effective Road Maintenance in the Caribbean. Natural Resources Institute. The University of Greenwich. United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of Application and Plants for Soil Bioengineering Control Works ==
Soil Bioengineering methods can be applied wherever the plants which are used as living building materials are able to grow well and develop.
This is the case in tropical, subtropical and [[temperate zone]]s whereas there are obvious limits in dry and cold regions, i.e. where arid, semi–arid and frost zones prevail. In exceptional cases, lack of water may be compensated for by watering or [[irrigation]].
In Europe, dry conditions limiting application exist in the Mediterranean as well as in some inner alpine and eastern European snowy regions. However, limits are most frequently imposed in alpine and arctic regions. These can usually be clearly noticed by the limited growth of woody plants ([[forest line|forest]], tree and shrub lines) and the upper limits of closed [[turf]] [[vegetative cover|cover]]. The more impoverished a region is in species, the less suited it is for the application of bioengineering methods.

== Functions and Effects of Soil Bioengineering Structures ==
===Technical functions===
*protection of soil surface from erosion by wind, precipitation, frost and flowing water
*protection from rock fall
*elimination or binding of destructive mechanical forces
*reduction of flow velocity along banks
*surface and/or deep soil cohesion and stabilization
*drainage
*protection from wind
*aiding the deposition of snow, drift sand and sediments
*increasing soil roughness and thus preventing avalanche release

Apart from these, ecological functions are gaining in importance, particularly as these can be fulfilled to a very limited extent only by classical engineering constructions.

===Ecological functions===
*improvement of water regime by improved soil interception and storage capability as well as water
*consumption by plants
*[[soil drainage]]
*protection from wind
*protection from ambient [[air pollution]]
*mechanical [[soil amelioration]] by the roots of plants
*balancing of temperature conditions in near–ground layers of air and in the soil
*[[shading]]
*improvement of nutrient content in the soil and thus of soil fertility on previously raw soils
*balancing of snow deposits
*[[noise protection]]
*yield increase on neighbouring cropland

===Landscaping functions===
*healing of wounds inflicted on the landscape by disasters and humans (exploitation of mineral resources, construction work, deposition of overburden, tunnel excavation material, industrial and domestic waste)
*integration of structures into the landscape
*concealment of offending structures
*enrichment of the landscape by creating new features and structures, shapes and colours of vegetation

===Economic effects===

Bioengineering control works are not always necessarily cheaper in construction when compared to classical engineering structures. However, when taking into account their lifetime including their service and maintenance, they will normally turn out to be more economical.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Their special advantages are:

*lower construction costs compared to “hard” constructions
*lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs
*creation of useful green areas and woody plant populations on previously derelict land
*Useful for income generation 
The result of soil bioengineering protection works are living systems which develop further and maintain their balance by natural succession (i.e. by dynamic self–control, without artificial input of energy). If the right living but also non–living building materials and the appropriate types of construction are chosen, exceptionally high sustainability requiring little maintenance effort can be achieved. &lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H.M. and R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19774">'''Stratospheric sulfur aerosols''' are [[sulfur]]-rich [[particulate|particles]] which exist in the [[stratosphere]] region of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].  The layer of the atmosphere in which they exist is known as the Junge layer, or simply the stratospheric aerosol layer.  These particles consist of a mixture of [[sulfuric acid]] and water.  They are created naturally, such as by [[photochemical]] decomposition of sulfur-containing gases, e.g. [[carbonyl sulfide]].  When present in high levels, e.g. after a strong volcanic eruption such as [[Mount Pinatubo]], they produce a cooling effect, by reflecting sunlight, and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere.&lt;ref name=bala2008&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = G. | last1 = Bala| last2 = Duffy| first2 = B.| last3 = Taylor | first3 = E.| title = Impact of geoengineering schemes on the global hydrological cycle| format = Free full text| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]| url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18505844| volume = 105| issue = 22| pages = 7664–7669| date=June 2008 | issn = 0027-8424| pmid = 18505844| pmc = 2409412| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711648105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.7664B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out.

An [[aerosol]] is a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of fine [[solid]] [[particulate|particles]] or [[liquid]] droplets in a [[gas]].  
The [[sulfate]] particles or [[sulfuric acid]] droplets in the atmosphere are about 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) in diameter.

Sulfur aerosols are common in the [[troposphere]] as a result of [[pollution]] with [[sulfur dioxide]] from burning [[coal]], and from natural processes.  [[Volcano]]s are a major source of particles in the stratosphere as the force of the [[volcanic eruption]] propels sulfur-containing gases into the stratosphere.  The relative influence of volcanoes on the Junge layer varies considerably according to the number and size of eruptions in any given time period, and also of quantities of sulfur compounds released.  Only [[stratovolcanoes]] containing primarily [[granitic]] rocks are responsible for these fluxes, as [[basaltic]] rock erupted in [[shield volcanoes]] doesn't result in plumes which reach the stratosphere.

Creating stratospheric sulfur aerosols deliberately is a proposed [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] technique which offers a possible solution to some of the problems caused by [[global warming]].  However, this will not be without side effects &lt;ref name=wigley2006&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1131728 | year = 2006 | author = Wigley, T.M. | title = A combined mitigation/geoengineering approach to climate stabilization | volume = 314 | issue = 5798 | pages = 452–4 | pmid = 16973840 | journal = Science | bibcode=2006Sci...314..452W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that the cure may be worse than the disease.&lt;ref name=Robock08/&gt;

Natural sulfur aerosols are formed in vast quantities from the [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] ejected by [[volcanoes]],&lt;ref name="nasa-aerosols"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/s02aerosols.php |title=Volcanic Sulfur Aerosols Affect Climate and the Earth's Ozone Layer |accessdate=17 February 2009 |publisher=United States Geological Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be injected directly into the stratosphere during very large ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], VEI, of 4 or greater) eruptions. A comprehensive analysis, dealing largely with tropospheric sulfur compounds in the [[atmosphere]], is provided by Bates et al.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/bate1229/estimate.shtml |title=Sulfur emissions to the atmosphere from natural sources | journal=Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry |volume=14 |issue=1–4 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF00115242 |pages=315–337 |author=Bates, T.S., B.K. Lamb, A. Guenther, J. Dignon and R.E. Stoiber |bibcode=1992JAtC...14..315B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC AR4 says ''explosive volcanic events are episodic, but the stratospheric aerosols resulting from them yield substantial transitory perturbations to the radiative energy balance of the planet, with both shortwave and longwave effects sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the aerosols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During periods lacking volcanic activity (and thus direct injection of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the stratosphere), oxidation of COS ([[carbonyl sulfide]]) dominates the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Aero_Ed_Center/Category/A_sulfate.html |title=Sulfate Aerosols }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{main|Sulfur cycle}}

The chemistry of stratospheric sulfur aerosols varies significantly according to their source.  Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH3-4D2FG64-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1c4665fbf2e86907a5353ec113b2f610 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2004.06.017 |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=38 |issue=33 |year=2004 |pages=5637–5649 |title=Aerosol chemistry of emissions from three contrasting volcanoes in Italy |author=Mathera, T.A., C. Oppenheimer, A.G. Allen and A.J.S. McGonigle |bibcode=2004AtmEn..38.5637M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical reactions affecting both the formation and elimination of sulfur aerosols are not fully understood.  It is difficult to estimate accurately, for example, whether the presence of ash and water vapour is important for aerosol formation from volcanic products, and whether high or low atmospheric concentrations of precursor chemicals (such as SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) are optimal for aerosol formation.  This uncertainty makes it difficult to determine a viable approach for geoengineering uses of sulfur aerosol formation.

Understanding of these aerosols comes in large part from the study of [[volcanic eruption]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/315/5808/84 |journal=Science |title=Mass-Independent Sulfur Isotopic Compositions in Stratospheric Volcanic Eruptions |author=Baroni, M., M.H.

The formation of the aerosols and their effects on the atmosphere can also be studied in the lab.  Samples of actual particles can be recovered from the [[stratosphere]] using balloons or aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsa.uniparthenope.it/dsa/LinkClick.aspx?link=DUSTER_Summary.pdf&amp;tabid=926&amp;mid=4373&amp;language=it-IT |title=The DUSTER experiment: collection and analysis of aerosol in the high stratosphere |author=Palumbo, P., A.

Zona |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer models can be used to understand the behaviour of aerosol particles, and are particularly useful in modelling their effect on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914182715.htm |title=Stratospheric Injections Could Help Cool Earth, Computer Model Shows | accessdate=19 February 2009 |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological experiments in the lab, and field/ocean measurements can establish the formation mechanisms of biologically derived volatile sulfurous gases.&lt;ref name="bates" /&gt;

== Effects ==

It has been established that emission of precursor gases for sulfur aerosols is the principal mechanism by which volcanoes cause episodic [[global cooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Rampino MR, Self S |title=Sulphur-rich volcanic eruptions and stratospheric aerosols |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=677–9 |date=23 August 1984 |doi=10.1038/310677a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v310/n5979/abs/310677a0.html |issue=5979|bibcode = 1984Natur.310..677R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] AR4 regards stratospheric sulfate aerosols as having a low level of scientific understanding.

This creates a [[global dimming]] effect, where less of the sun's radiation is able to reach the surface of the Earth. This leads to a [[global cooling]] effect. In essence, they act as the reverse of a [[greenhouse gas]], which tends to allow visible light from the sun through, whilst blocking [[infrared light]] emitted from the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. The particles also radiate infrared energy directly, as they lose heat into space.

[[file:Mauna Loa atmospheric transmission.png|thumb|Solar radiation reduction due to volcanic eruptions]]

All aerosols both [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] and [[scattering|scatter]] [[sunlight|solar]] and terrestrial [[radiation]]. This is quantified in the ''Single Scattering Albedo'' (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (''extinction'') of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.

Aerosols, natural and [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]], can affect the climate by changing the way [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] is transmitted through the atmosphere. Direct observations of the effects of aerosols are quite limited so any attempt to estimate their global effect necessarily involves the use of computer models. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], IPCC, says: ''While the radiative forcing due to [[greenhouse gas]]es may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | contribution=Chapter 6 Radiative Forcing of Climate Change | url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/237.htm#678 | title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

These holes in the ozone layer have the potential to expand to cover inhabited and vegetative regions of the planet, leading to catastrophic environmental damage.

Ozone destruction occurs principally in [[polar region]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.theozonehole.com/ozonedestruction.htm |title=The Ozone Hole-Ozone Destruction |accessdate=19 February 2009 |publisher=Theozonehole.com |author=Charles Welch }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the formation of ozone occurs principally in the [[tropics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.solcomhouse.com/ozone.htm |publisher=Solcomhouse.com |author=Charles Welch |accessdate=19 February 2009 |title=Ozone }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone is distributed around the planet by the [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/MAM/jones_Brewer_Dobson.pdf |format=PDF |title=Brewer-Dobson Circulation |author=Dylan Jones |work=GCC Summer School }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the source and dispersal pattern of aerosols is critical in understanding their effect on the ozone layer.

[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|Turner was inspired by dramatic sunsets caused by volcanic aerosols]]

Aerosols scatter light, which affects the appearance of the sky and of [[sunset]]s. Changing the concentration of aerosols in the [[atmosphere]] can dramatically affect the appearance of [[sunset]]s. A change in sky appearance during 1816, [["The Year Without A Summer"]] (attributed to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]]), was the inspiration for the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Further volcanic eruptions and [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] projects involving sulfur aerosols are likely to affect the appearance of sunsets significantly,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=Olson, D.

Aerosol particles are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean. Depending on the volume of particles descending, the effects may be significant to ecosystems, or may not be. Modelling of the quantities of aerosols used in likely geoengineering scenarios suggest that effects on terrestrial ecosystems from deposition is not likely to be significantly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference |bibcode=2008AGUFM.U43A0041K |title=Acid Deposition From Stratospheric Geoengineering With Sulfate Aerosols |author=Kravitz, B., A.

The ability of stratospheric sulfur aerosols to create this [[global dimming]] effect has made them a possible candidate for use in [[climate engineering]] projects to limit the effect and impact of [[climate change]] due to rising levels of [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/84j11614488142u8/ |journal=Phil.

'''Vascular tissue''' is a complex conducting [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], formed of more than one cell type, found in [[vascular plant]]s. The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two [[meristem]]s associated with vascular tissue: the [[vascular cambium]] and the [[cork cambium]].  All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the '''vascular tissue system''' of that plant.

The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes.  The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue [[cellular differentiation|differentiates]] in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant.
The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called [[vascular bundles]].  These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells.  In [[plant stem|stems]] and [[root]]s, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem.  In the stems of some Asterales [[dicot]]s, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.

Between the xylem and phloem is a [[meristem]] called the vascular cambium.  This tissue divides off [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length.  As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout.  In [[tree]]s and other plants that develop [[wood]], the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the stem, woody plants also have a [[cork cambium]] that develops among the phloem.  The cork cambium gives rise to thickened [[cork (tissue)|cork]] cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.  Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of [[secondary growth]].

In [[leaf|leaves]], the vascular bundles are located among the spongy [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]]. The xylem is oriented toward the [[adaxial]] surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the [[abaxial]] surface of the leaf.  This is why [[aphid]]s are typically found on the undersides of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3151">'''Vector optimization''' is a subarea of [[mathematical optimization]] where [[Optimization problem|optimization problems]] with a vector-valued [[objective function]]s are optimized with respect to a given [[partial ordering]] and subject to certain constraints.  A [[multi-objective optimization]] problem is a special case of a vector optimization problem: The objective space is the finite dimensional [[Euclidean space]] partially ordered by the component-wise "less than or equal to" ordering. 

== Problem formulation ==
In mathematical terms, a vector optimization problem can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;C\operatorname{-}\min_{x \in S} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Z&lt;/math&gt; for a partially ordered [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The partial ordering is induced by a cone &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq Z&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary set and &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is called the feasible set.

== Solution concepts ==
There are different minimality notions, among them:
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} \in S&lt;/math&gt; is a ''weakly efficient point'' (weak minimizer) if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt; one has &lt;math&gt;f(x) - f(\bar{x}) \not\in -\operatorname{int} C&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} \in S&lt;/math&gt; is an ''efficient point'' (minimizer) if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt; one has &lt;math&gt;f(x) - f(\bar{x}) \not\in -C \backslash \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} \in S&lt;/math&gt; is a ''properly efficient point'' (proper minimizer) if &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a weakly efficient point with respect to a [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] [[convex cone|pointed convex cone]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C \backslash \{0\} \subseteq \operatorname{int} \tilde{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every proper minimizer is a minimizer.  And every minimizer is a weak minimizer.&lt;ref name="scalar2vector"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ginchev | first1 = I. | last2 = Guerraggio | first2 = A. | last3 = Rocca | first3 = M. | title = From Scalar to Vector Optimization | doi = 10.1007/s10492-006-0002-1 | journal = Applications of Mathematics | volume = 51 | pages = 5 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = https://irinsubria.uninsubria.it/bitstream/11383/1500550/1/am51-5-GinI-GueA-RocM-06.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern solution concepts not only consists of minimality notions but also take into account [[infimum]] attainment.&lt;ref name="Lohne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vector Optimization with Infimum and Supremum|author=Andreas Löhne|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9783642183508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution methods ==

== Relation to multi-objective optimization ==
Any multi-objective optimization problem can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d_+\operatorname{-}\min_{x \in M} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d_+&lt;/math&gt; is the non-negative [[orthant]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the minimizer of this vector optimization problem are the [[Pareto efficient]] points.
