'''''Asterix''''' or '''''The Adventures of Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|Astérix}} or ''Astérix le Gaulois'' {{IPA-fr|asteʁiks lə ɡolwa|}}) is a series of [[French comics]]. The series first appeared in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on 29 October 1959. It was written by [[René Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. In 2013, a new team consisting of [[Jean-Yves Ferri]] (script) and [[Didier Conrad]] (artwork) took over. As of 2017, 37 volumes have been released.

The series follows the adventures of a village of [[Gauls]] as they resist [[Roman Republic|Roman]] occupation in 50 BC. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]] Panoramix (named Getafix in the English translations), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] and his friend [[Obelix]], have various adventures. The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) alludes to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as [[Vercingetorix]], [[Orgetorix]] and [[Dumnorix]]. In many of the stories, they travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The ''Asterix'' series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|title=Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World|date=November 19, 2009|newspaper=Time|first=Leo|last=Cendrowicz|access-date=7 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908022648/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|archive-date=8 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into [[List of Asterix films|13 films]]: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, ''[[Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]'', was [[Lists of highest-grossing films in France|a major box office success in France]]). There have also been a number of [[List of Asterix games|games]] based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, [[Parc Astérix]]. The very first French satellite, [[Astérix (satellite)|Astérix]], launched in 1965, was also named after the comics character. As of 2017, 370{{nbsp}}million copies of ''Asterix'' books have been sold worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ye |first1=Sonia |title=With the crazy 'Italics', Asterix returns for 37th adventure |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-asterix/with-the-crazy-italics-asterix-returns-for-37th-adventure-idUSKBN1CO10X |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=October 19, 2017 |access-date=6 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195620/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-asterix/with-the-crazy-italics-asterix-returns-for-37th-adventure-idUSKBN1CO10X |archive-date=6 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo being France's best-selling authors abroad.&lt;ref name="Volumes-sold"&gt;{{cite news | last= volumes-sold | title= Asterix the Gaul rises sky high | url= http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-43015020091008 | work= Reuters | date= 8 October 2009 | access-date= 9 October 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010020156/http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-43015020091008 | archive-date= 10 October 2009 | dead-url= no | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buzz.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2004-54995.asp |title=Goscinny and Uderzo |author=Sonal Panse |date= |website= |publisher=Buzzle.com |accessdate=11 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101142444/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-3-2004-54995.asp |archive-date=1 November 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prior to creating the ''Asterix'' series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was published in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Comic creator"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lambiek.net/home.htm|title=René Goscinny|author= |date= |website= |publisher=Comic creator |accessdate=9 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324201421/http://lambiek.net/home.htm| archivedate= 24 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Astérix'' was originally serialised in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959.&lt;ref name="Pilote-1959"&gt;{{cite web | last =BDoubliées | title =Pilote année 1959 | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | language =French | access-date =28 April 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110525075208/http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm | archive-date =25 May 2011 | dead-url =no | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the first book was put together, titled ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth ''Asterix'' volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.

Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.&lt;ref name="Kessler Peter"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kessler |first1= Peter |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Asterix Complete Guide |trans-title= |edition= First |series= |volume= |date=2 November 1995 |origyear= |publisher=Hodder Children's Books;  |location= |isbn=978-0-340-65346-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter= |chapter= |url= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing popularity of ''Asterix'' with the readers, the financial backing for ''Pilote'' ceased. ''Pilote'' was taken over by [[Dargaud|Georges Dargaud]].&lt;ref name="Kessler Peter"/&gt;

When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums.&lt;ref name="beeb"/&gt; Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions [[Albert-René]], which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.&lt;ref name="Kessler Peter"/&gt; However, [[Dargaud]], the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

In December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.&lt;ref&gt;Lezard, Nicholas (January 16, 2009), "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde Asterix has sold out to the Empire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819074148/https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde |date=19 August 2016 }}," [[The Guardian]] (retrieved June 21, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''Astérix'' adventures after his death. She said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[…] the co-creator of ''Astérix'', France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shirbon | first=Estelle | work=[[Reuters]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | title=Asterix battles new Romans in publishing dispute | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525025049/http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE50D46K20090114 | archive-date=25 May 2009 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm | title=Divisions emerge in Asterix camp | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=16 January 2009 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119011222/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7831375.stm| archivedate= 19 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, René Goscinny's daughter, Anne, also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that "''Asterix'' has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it. Why not a third?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodoi.info/magazine/2009-01-20/anne-goscinny-%C2%ABasterix-a-eu-deja-eu-deux-vies-du-vivant-de-mon-pere-et-apres-pourquoi-pas-une-troisieme%C2%BB/10581 |title=Anne Goscinny: "Astérix a eu déjà eu deux vies, du vivant de mon père et après.

In January 2015, after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|murders]] of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', ''Astérix'' creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two ''Astérix'' pictures honouring the memories of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/charlie-hebdo-asterix-creator-albert-uderzo-comes-out-of-retirement-to-draw-je-suis-charlie-cartoon-9968835.html|title=Asterix creator comes out of retirement to declare 'Moi aussi je suis un Charlie'|date=2015-01-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719011653/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/charlie-hebdo-asterix-creator-albert-uderzo-comes-out-of-retirement-to-draw-je-suis-charlie-cartoon-9968835.html|archive-date=19 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Asterix Conquers Rome]]'' is a comics adaptation of the animated film ''[[The Twelve Tasks of Asterix]]''. It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the ''[[Asterix Annual 1980]]'' and never an English standalone volume. A picture-book version of the same story was published in English translation as ''The Twelve Tasks of Asterix'' by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1978.

In 1996, a tribute album in honour of Albert Uderzo was released titled "[[Uderzo Croqué par ses Amis]]", a volume containing 21 short stories with Uderzo in Ancient Gaul. This volume was published by [[Soleil Productions]] and has not been translated into English

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled ''[[Astérix et ses Amis]]'', a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. {{as of|2016}}, it has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |title=Les albums hors collection - Astérix et ses Amis - Hommage à Albert Uderzo |publisher=Asterix.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607234005/http://www.asterix.com/edition/albums-hors-collection/asterix-et-ses-amis.html |archive-date=7 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the publisher French Hachette along with Anne Goscinny and Albert Uderzo decided to make the special issue album ''[[The XII Tasks of Asterix]]'' for the 40th anniversary of the film ''The Twelve Tasks of Asterix''.

==Synopsis and characters==
{{Main|List of Asterix characters}}
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village (rumoured to be inspired by [[Erquy]]) in [[Armorica]] (present-day [[Brittany]]), a province of [[Gaul]] (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Republic. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]]. His chief is [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]].

The main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by [[List of Asterix characters#Dogmatix|Dogmatix]], his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of [[Gaul]] ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations ([[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]] etc.), and far away lands ([[North America]], [[Middle East]], [[India]] etc.).

The series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.

==Humour==

The humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics often centers around puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous "''Ils sont fous ces romains''" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as "Sono pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as "hips", but in English as "hic", allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc"). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |author= |date=18 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208100111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm| archivedate= 8 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character names===
All the fictional characters in ''Asterix'' have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife [[List of Asterix characters#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]] (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in [[List of Asterix characters#Romans|Gluteus Maximus]], a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the [[gluteus maximus|butt]] of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and [[Theoderic]], for example [[Rhetoric]] the interpreter. Greek names end in "-os" or "-es";  for example, [[Thermos]] the restaurateur. British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the [[taxation]] associated with the later [[United Kingdom]], such as [[Value added tax|Valuaddedtax]] the druid and [[Selective employment tax|Selectivemploymentax]] the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to [[Pidgin]] translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning [[eggs and bacon]], is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like [[List of Asterix characters#Caricatures|Dubbelosix]] (a reference to [[James Bond]]'s codename 007).

Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]] is ''Panoramix'' in the original French and ''Miraculix'' in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|publisher=Asterix the official website|title=A to Z of Asterix: Getafix|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111204808/http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|archive-date=11 January 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as ''Idéfix'' (from ''idée fixe'', a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called ''Dogmatix'' in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.

The name ''Asterix'', [[French language|French]] ''Astérix'', comes from ''{{lang|fr|astérisque}}'', meaning "[[asterisk]]", which is the typographical symbol '''*''' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ (''aster''), meaning a "star". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s. For example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'' (in Turkish he was first named ''Bücür'' meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed). Two exceptions include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], in which he is known as ''Ástríkur'' ("Rich of love") and [[Sinhalese Language|Sinhalese]], where he is known as සූර පප්පා (''Soora Pappa''), which can be interpreted as "[[Hero]]".

For explanations of some of the other names, see [[List of Asterix characters|List of ''Asterix'' characters]].

===Ethnic stereotypes===

Many of the Asterix adventures take place in other countries aside from their homeland, Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, they meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country as seen by the French.

* Italics (Italians) are the inhabitants of Italy. In the adventures of Asterix, the term "Romans" is used by non-Italics to refer to all inhabitants of Italy, who at that time had extended their dominion over a large part of the Mediterranean basin. But as can be seen in [[Asterix and the Chariot Race]], in the Italic peninsula this term is used only to the people from the capital, with many Italics preferring to identify themselves as Umbrians, Etruscans, Venetians, etc. Various topics from this country are explored, as in this case the Italian gastronomy (pasta, pizza, wine), art, famous people (Pavarotti, Berlusconi, Mona Lisa) and even the controversial issue of political corruption.
* Goths (Germans) are disciplined and militarists, they are composed of many races that fight each other (which is a reference to Germany before [[Otto von Bismarck]] and to East and West Germany after the Second World War) and they wear the [[Pickelhaube]] helmet common during the [[German Empire]].
* Helvetians (Swiss) are neutral, eat [[fondue]], and are obsessed with cleaning, accurate time-keeping, and banks.
* The Britons (English) are [[phlegmatic]] and speak with early 20th century aristocratic slang (like [[Bertie Wooster]]). They stop for [[Tea (drink)|Tea]] every day (making it with hot water and a drop of milk until Asterix brings them actual [[tea]] leaves), drink lukewarm beer ([[Bitter (beer)|Bitter]]), eat tasteless foods with mint sauce ([[Rosbif]]) and live in streets containing rows of identical houses.
* Hibernians (Irish) are the inhabitants of Hibernia, the Latin name of Ireland. They fight against the Romans alongside the Britons to defend the British Isles.
* Hispania (Spain) is a place [[tourism in Spain|full of tourists]]. Hispania is the country where people of northern Europe go on vacation (and ask to eat the same food they eat at their homelands), causing tremendous traffic jams in the Roman roads while traveling. Other recurring topics are flamenco, bullfighting and olive oil. Reference is also made to the famous character of [[Don Quixote]].
* When the Gauls visited North America in [[Asterix and the Great Crossing]], Obelix punches one of the attacking Native Americans with a [[knockout]] blow. The warrior sees first American-style emblematic eagles; the second time he sees stars in the formation of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]; the third time, he sees stars shaped like the [[United States military aircraft national insignia|United States Air Force roundel]]. Asterix's idea for getting the attention of a [[L'Anse aux Meadows|nearby Viking ship]] (which could take them back to Gaul) by holding up a torch refers to the Statue of Liberty (which was a gift from France).
* Corsicans are proud, patriotic, and easily aroused, but lazy and make decisions by using [[political corruption|pre-filled]] [[ballot box]]es. They harbour vendettas against each other and always take their [[siesta]]. 
* Greeks are [[chauvinism|chauvinists]] and consider Romans to be [[barbarians]]. They eat [[dolma|stuffed grape leaves]], drink [[retsina]] and always have a cousin for the appropriate job.
* Normans ([[Vikings]]) drink endlessly, they don't know what fear is (which they're trying to discover) and in their country ([[Scandinavia]]) night lasts for 6 months.
* Cimbres (Danes) are very similar to the Normans. But while Asterix and Obelix were unable to communicate with them, they are perfectly able to understand the Cimbres. Their names end in -ten, perhaps similar to those of the Normans, whose names end in -sen.
* Belgians speak with a funny accent, snub the Gauls and always eat sliced roots deep-fried in bear fat. They also tell [[Belgian joke]]s.
* Lusitanians (Portuguese) are short in stature and polite (Uderzo said all the Portuguese who he had met were like that).
* Sumerians, Assyrians, Hittites, Akkadians, and Babylonians are at war with each other and attack strangers because they confuse them for their enemies, but they apologize when they realize that the strangers are not their enemies. This is likely a criticism of the constant conflicts between the Middle Eastern peoples.
* The Jews are all depicted as [[Yemenite Jews]], with dark skin and black eyes and beards, a tribute to [[Marc Chagall]], the famous painter whose painting of [[King David]] hangs at the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament). Asterix's and Obelix's visit to [[Jerusalem]] is full of references to the [[Bible]].
* Numidians, contrary to the Berber inhabitants of ancient Numidia, located in North Africa, are obviously Africans from sub-Saharan Africa. The names end in -tha after the historical king [[Jugurtha]] of Numidia.
* The Picts (Scots) wear a typical dress with kilt (skirt), have the habit of drinking "malt water" (whisky) and throwing logs (caber tossing) as a popular sport and, of course, the names of the characters all start with Mac.
* Sarmatians (Russians). Inhabitants of the North Black Sea, who represent present-day Russia. Their names end in -ov, like many Russian surnames

When the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representation in the speech bubbles:

*Iberian: Same as Spanish, inversion of exclamations ('¡') and questions ("¿")
*Goth language: Gothic script (incomprehensible to the Gauls) (except Getafix)
*Viking (Normans and Cimbres): Ø and Å instead of O and A (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Amerindian: Pictograms and sign language (generally incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Egyptians and Kushites: Hieroglyphics with footnotes (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
*Greek: Straight letters, carved
*Sarmatian: In their speech balloons, some letters (E, F, N, R ...) are written in a mirrored form, which evokes somewhat the current Cyrillic alphabet.

In the former Yugoslavia, the "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican text in "[[Asterix in Corsica]]" into the Montenegrin dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]] (today called [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]).

In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], a Germanic language spoken in the province of [[Friesland]], into [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], a regional language spoken not only in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]] but also in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]] and into [[Tweants dialect|Tweants]], a dialect in the region of [[Twente]] in the eastern province of [[Overijssel]]. Hungarian-language books have been published in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] for the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority living in [[Serbia]]. Although not a fully autonomous dialect, the books differ slightly from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] (''Singhalese'') as ''Sura Pappa''.&lt;ref name="Asterix.com"/&gt;

Most volumes have been translated into [[Latin]] and [[Attic Greek|Ancient Greek]] with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

===English translation===
{{Main|English translations of Asterix}}
Before Asterix became famous, translations of some strips were published in British comics including ''Valiant'', ''Ranger'', and ''Look &amp; Learn'', under names ''Little Fred and Big Ed''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comictrip.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/asterix-le-breton-little-fred-big-ed-part-1/ |title=Astérix le Breton: Little Fred &amp; Big Ed (part 1) |website=ComicOrama en Français|date=  2015-04-21|author= |accessdate= 11 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601033832/https://comictrip.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/asterix-le-breton-little-fred-big-ed-part-1/|archive-date=1 June 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Beric the Bold'', set in Roman-occupied Britain.

===Games===
{{Main|List of Asterix games}}

Many [[gamebook]]s, [[board game]]s and [[video game]]s are based upon the ''Asterix'' series. In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.

===Theme park===

{{Main|Parc Astérix}}

[[Parc Astérix]], a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989. It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors per year.

==Influence in popular culture==

*The first French satellite, which was launched in 1965, was named ''[[Astérix (satellite)|Astérix-1]]'' in honour of Asterix. Asteroids [[29401 Asterix]] and [[29402 Obelix]] were also named in honour of the characters. Coincidentally, the word Asterix/Asterisk originates from the Greek for ''Little Star''.
*During the campaign for Paris to host the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], Asterix appeared in many posters over the [[Eiffel Tower]].
*The French company [[Kraft Foods|Belin]] introduced a series of ''Asterix'' [[crisps]] shaped in the forms of [[scutum (shield)|Roman shields]], [[gourd]]s, [[wild boar]], and [[bone]]s.
* In the UK in 1995, ''Asterix'' coins were presented free in every [[Nutella]] jar.
* In 1991, Asterix and Obelix appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' for a special edition about France, art directed by [[Mirko Ilić|Mirko Ilic]]. In a 2009 issue of the same magazine, Asterix is described as being seen by some as a symbol for France's independence and defiance of globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html |work=TIME |title=Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2009 |first=Leo |last=Cendrowicz |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024031144/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0%2C8599%2C1931169%2C00.html |archivedate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Asterix has made several promotional appearances for fast food chain McDonald's, including one advertisement which featured members of the village enjoying the traditional story-ending feast at a McDonald's restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/asterix-the-gaul-seen-feasting-at-mcdonald-s-restaurant |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2010 |title=Asterix the Gaul seen feasting at McDonald's restaurant |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110249/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/asterix-the-gaul-seen-feasting-at-mcdonald-s-restaurant |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Action Comics]]'' Number 579, published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986, written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier|Lofficier]] and Illustrated by [[Keith Giffen]], featured an homage to ''Asterix'' where [[Superman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] are drawn back in time to a small village of indomitable Gauls.
* In 2005, the Mirror World ''Asterix'' exhibition was held in [[Brussels]]. The Belgian post office also released a set of stamps to coincide with the exhibition.

[[File:Batsheva theater crowd in Tel Aviv by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|An audience in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]] waiting to see the [[Batsheva Dance Company]]]]
[[File:2013 World Championships in Athletics (August, 10) by Dmitry Rozhkov 137.jpg|thumb|Audiences at the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].]]
An '''audience''' is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called "readers"), theatre, music (in which they are called "listeners"), video games (in which they are called "players"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.

Media audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. [[Audience theory]] offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. The biggest art form is the mass media. Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations.

In the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, "Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don't give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html |title=The People Formerly Known as the Audience |accessdate=August 5, 2012 |last=Rosen |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Rosen |date=June 27, 2006 |publisher=Press Think |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830232111/http://archive.pressthink.org/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html |archivedate=2016-08-30 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, "The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be — what application, what device, what time, what place."&lt;ref name= "Rosen" /&gt;

==Types==

===Particular (real)===
In rhetoric, some audiences depend on circumstance and situation, and are characterized by the individuals that make up the audience. Sometimes these audiences are subject to persuasion and engage with the ideas of the speaker. Ranging in size and composition, this audience may come together and form a "composite" of multiple groups.

====Immediate====
An immediate audience is a type of audience that is composed of individuals who are face-to-face subjects with a speaker and a speaker's rhetorical text or speech. This audience directly listens to, engages with, and consumes the rhetorical text in an unmediated fashion. In measuring immediate audience reception and feedback, (audience measurement), one can depend on personal interviews, applause, and verbal comments made during and after a rhetorical speech.

====Mediated==== &lt;!-- [[Television viewer]] redirects here --&gt;
In contrast to immediate audiences, mediated audiences are composed of individuals who consume rhetorical texts in a manner that is different from the time or place in which a speaker presents text. Audiences who consume texts or speeches through television, radio and internet are considered mediated audiences because those mediums separate the rhetor and the audience. Such audiences are physically away from the audience and the message is controlled. Understanding the size and composition of mediated audiences can be difficult because mediums such as television, radio, and Internet can displace the audience from the time and circumstance of a rhetorical text or speech. In measuring mediated audience reception and feedback (a practice called [[audience measurement]]), one can depend on opinion polls and ratings, as well as comments and forums that may be featured on a website. This applies to may fields such as movies, songs and much more. There are companies that specialise in audience measurement. 

===Theoretical (imagined)===
Theoretical audiences are imagined for the purpose of helping a speaker compose, practice, or a critic to understand, a rhetorical text or speech.

====Self (self-deliberation)====
When a rhetor deeply considers, questions, and deliberates over the content of the ideas they are conveying, it can be said that these individuals are addressing the audience of self, or self-deliberating. Scholars Chaim Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca, in their book ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation'',&lt;ref name= Perelman&gt;{{cite book |last=Perelman |first=Chaim |authorlink= Chaim Perelman |author2= L. Olbrechts-Tyteca |title=The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation |location= Notre Dame, Indiana |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |year= 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the rhetor "is in a better position than anyone else to test the value of his own arguments." The audience of self, while not serving as the ends to all rhetorical purpose or circumstance, nevertheless acts as a type of audience that not only operates as a function of self-help, but as instrument used to discover the available means of persuasion.

====Universal====
The universal audience is an imagined audience that serves as an ethical and argumentative test for the rhetor. This also requires the speaker to imagine a composite audience that contains individuals from diverse backgrounds and to discern whether or not the content of the rhetorical text or speech would appeal to individuals within that audience. Scholars [[Chaïm_Perelman|Perelman]] and [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca|Olbrechts-Tyteca]] ascertain that the content addressed to a universal audience "must convince the reader that the reasons adduced are of a compelling character, that they are self-evident, and possess an absolute and timeless validity".&lt;ref name= Perelman /&gt; The concept of the universal audience has received criticism for being idealistic because it can be considered as an impediment in achieving persuasive effect with particular audiences. Yet, it still may be useful as an ethical guide for a speaker and a critical tool for a reader or audience.

====Ideal====
An ideal audience is a rhetor's imagined, intended audience. In creating a rhetorical text, a rhetor imagines is the target audience, a group of individuals that will be addressed, persuaded, or affected by the speech or rhetorical text. This type of audience is not necessarily imagined as the most receptive audience, but as the future particular audience that the rhetor will engage with. Imagining such an audience allows a rhetor to formulate appeals that will grant success in engaging with the future particular audience. In considering an ideal audience, a rhetor can imagine future conditions of mediation, size, demographics, and shared beliefs among the audience to be persuaded.

====Implied====
An implied audience is an imaginary audience determined by an auditor or reader as the text's constructed audience. The implied audience is not the actual audience, but the one that can be inferred by reading or analyzing the text. Communications scholar Edwin Black, in his essay, The Second Persona,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Black |first=Edwin |chapter= The Second Persona |editor1 = John Lucaites|editor2= Celeste Michelle Condit|editor3= Sally Caudill|title = Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader |year = 1998 |publisher = Guilford | location = New York |isbn = 1-572-30401-4 |pages = 331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents the theoretical concept of the implied audience using the idea of two personae. The first persona is the implied rhetoric (the idea of the speaker formed by the audience) and the second persona is the implied audience (the idea of the audience formed by and utilized for persuasion in the speech situation). A critic could also determine what the text wants that audience to become or do after the rhetorical situation.

===== On the web =====
Through the Internet, every person is given the opportunity to participate in different ways. The Internet gives people a platform to write and reach the people who are interested in what they are writing about. When writers write online, they are able to form communities with the people they share common interests with. The audiences that people are trying to reach can be general or specific, all depending on what the writer is discussing in their online posts. Audiences have to go and check into what the writers are writing to stay on top of the latest information. Writers have to find their niche and try hard to work their way into an already formed community. The audience the writer is reaching is able to respond to the writers posts and can give feedback. The Internet allows these connections to be formed and fostered. In the ''Here Comes Everybody'' book by Clay Shirky, there are various examples of how audience is not only receiving content but actually creating it. Internet creates a chance of being part of an audience and a creator at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Here Comes Everybody|last = Shirky|first = Clay|publisher = Penguin Group|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-59420-153-0|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience participation==
[[File:Brooklyn Book Festival crowd by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|An audience at the [[Brooklyn Book Festival]] in [[New York City]].]]
Audience participation is commonly found in performances which break the [[fourth wall]]. Examples include the traditional British [[pantomime]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[stand-up comedy]], and creative stage shows such as [[Blue Man Group]].

Audience participation can be uncomfortable for certain people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/article/why-audience-participation-is-so-terrifying.html|title=Why Audience Participation Is So Terrifying|last=Ro|first=Christine|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-08-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is growing and evolving as a new tool of brand activation and [[brand engagement]]. In a bid to create and reinforce a special bond between brands and their consumers, companies are increasingly looking towards events that involve active audience participation. Often, organizations provide branded objects to event attendees that will involve the audience in the show as well as act as souvenirs of the event, creating a lasting link with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4189295 Cornwell, T. B., Weeks, C. S., &amp; Roy, D. P. (2005). Sponsorship-linked marketing: Opening the blackbox. Journal of Advertising, 34, 21-42.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], the audience was incorporated in the Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show as part of the lighting effects. Pepsi involved the spectators by giving them "video ski hats" that produced visual effects across the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Lampert-Greaux (February 3, 2014) [http://livedesignonline.com/news/pixmob-brings-led-technology-super-bowl-xlviii-halftime-show PixMob Brings LED Technology To The Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show] Live Design Online&lt;/ref&gt;
By appealing more directly to people and emotions, brands can obtain feedback from their consumers. Companies that provide or seek such experiences refer to the term "crowd activation". For example, Tangible Interaction named one of its branches Crowd Activation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowdactivation.com/about Crowd Activation by Tangible Interaction - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; and PixMob refers to itself as a crowd activation company on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pixmob.com/ PixMob - Crowd Activation]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known examples of popular audience participation accompanies the motion picture and music ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' and its earlier stage incarnation ''The [[Rocky Horror Show]]''. The audience participation elements are often seen as the most important part of the picture, to the extent that the audio options on the DVD version include the option.

[[File:20090814 Pritzker Pavilion on Beethoven's 9th Day crop.JPG|thumb|Some of this audience at the [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]] provided their own seating to hear [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] at the [[Grant Park Music Festival]]]]

===Examples===
[[Image:Audience Frontier Fiesta.jpg|thumb|Audience at a Frontier Fiesta show, 1950s]]
[[Image:HK Ocean Park Audience.JPG|right|thumb|Audience at a show in Hong Kong.]]

In the audience participation for the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]], the audience will make "call backs", and yell at the screen at certain parts of the movie. Also, a number of props are thrown and used by the audience during certain parts of the film. 

In British pantomime performances, the audience is a crucial aspect of the show and is expected to perform certain tasks such as:
* Interacting with an "audience friend", a character often designed to be comedic and sympathetic, such as [[Buttons (pantomime)|Buttons]] from [[Cinderella]].  Typical interactions include [[call and response]] (e.g. Buttons: "Hiya gang!" Audience: "Hiya Buttons!")
* Booing and hissing at the villain
* Back and forth arguments, usually composed of simple, repetitive phrases (e.g. Character: "No there isn't!" Audience: "Yes there is!")
* "Ghost gags", where the audience yells loudly to inform the character of imminent danger, usually whilst the character is completely aloof.

''[[The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)]]'' divides the audience into groups assigned to call out the concerns of three components of a character's psyche. 

In ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (musical)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', a [[Broadway theatre]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on [[Charles Dickens]]'s last, unfinished work, the audience must vote for whom they think the murderer is, as well as the real identity of the detective and the couple who end up together.

The 1984 Summer Olympics included [[card stunt]]s at the Olympic Stadium. 

[[Tony and Tina's Wedding]] engages the entire audience at once, staging a narrative set during a wedding in which the audience performs the role of "guests".

The British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'' often allows the audience to try to answer questions. Currently, the audience have won one show, and have come last in another.

Magic shows often rely on some audience participation. Psychological illusionist [[Derren Brown]] relies heavily on audience participation in his live shows.

During performances of the [[Radetzky March]], it is traditional for the audience to clap along with the beat of the second (louder) repetitions of the chorus. This is particularly notable at the [[Neujahrskonzert]].

[[Blog]]gers often allow their readers moderated or unmoderated comments sections.

Some musical groups often heavily incorporate audience participation into their live shows. The [[superhero]]-themed comedy rock band [[The Aquabats]] typically do so within their [[The Aquabats#Live performances|theatrical stage shows]] through such antics as "pool floatie races", where members of the band race across the venue on inflatable rafts via [[crowd surfing]], or providing the audience with projectiles (such as [[ball pit|plastic balls]] or [[beach ball]]s) to throw at costumed "bad guys" who come out on stage. [[Koo Koo Kanga Roo]], a comedy dance-pop duo, write their music solely for audience participation, utilizing [[call and response (music)|call and response]] style [[sing-along]] songs which are usually accompanied by a simple [[dance move]] that the band encourage the audience to follow along with.

===Faux participation===

The television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' featured a man and his robots who were held as imprisoned audience members and tortured by being forced to view "bad" movies; to retain their sanity, they talked throughout and [[Heckler|heckled]] each one.

In a similar vein, the online site [[Television Without Pity]] has a stable of reviewers and [[:wikt:recapitulation|recappers]] who speak the [[Jargon|lingo]] of audience members rather than of scholars, and who sometimes act as though they, too, are being tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/recaps.php |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': We fall to pieces |publisher=Television Without Pity |date=May 6, 2002 |quote=[[Everybody Hurts|Everybody hurts...sometimes]]. The only question remaining is: who's hurting the most? Is it Anya, Xander, Buffy, and Spike for having to live this crap, or [recapper] Ace for having to watch it? |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802071907/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/recaps.php |archivedate=August 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further information|Studio audience}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4037">'''Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre''' (BBC or BSBC) is a [[butterfly zoo]] near [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia. Founded in 2009, it is the largest enclosed butterfly centre in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3053505/Cambodian-hearts-aflutter-struggling-butterflies.html "Cambodian hearts aflutter over struggling butterflies"]. ''Daily Mail'', 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is sometimes referred to as the Angkor Butterfly Center.

Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre has been designed and financed by Ben Hayes and Mike Baltzer, two British butterfly enthusiasts, who had previously set up the [[Zanzibar Butterfly Centre]] in Tanzania, East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/siem-reap-insider/angkor-butterfly-ctr-set-launch "Angkor Butterfly Ctr set to launch"]. ''Phnom Penh Post'', Peter Olszewski | Publication date 09 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zanzibarbutterflies.com/ Zanzibar Butterfly Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; It is financed as a tourist attraction, generating income for running the centre and local charity projects. BBC is part of the [[ConCERT project]], a Cambodian project connecting responsible tourism with environmental conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concertcambodia.org/ ConCERT - Connecting Communities, Environment &amp; Responsible Tourism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientifically, butterflies belong to the insect group of [[lepidopterans]], which also includes moths, and moths also have the attention of Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre. The centre showcase examples of the large variety of lepidopterans in Cambodia, preferably local varieties, in large netted garden environment. As butterflies have a short lifespan of no more than a few weeks and because many species are seasonal, there are twice as many species present around the centre during November and December.&lt;ref&gt;See Cambodian Butterfly Farming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre also works as a sustainable butterfly farm, providing training for locals.&lt;ref name="Turner2017"&gt;T Turner.

'''Barbie''' is a [[fashion doll]] manufactured by the American toy company [[Mattel|Mattel, Inc.]] and launched in March 1959. American businesswoman [[Ruth Handler]] is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called [[Bild Lilli doll|Bild Lilli]] as her inspiration.

Barbie is the figurehead of a brand of Mattel dolls and accessories, including other family members and collectible dolls. Barbie has been an important part of the toy [[fashion]] doll market for over fifty years, and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits, often involving parodies of the doll and her lifestyle.

Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company’s largest and most profitable line. However, sales have declined sharply since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ziobro, "Mattel to Add Curvy, Petite, Tall Barbies: Sales of the doll have fallen at double-digit rate for past eight quarters," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-to-add-curvy-petite-tall-barbies-1453991134 ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 28, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  The doll transformed the toy business in affluent communities worldwide by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends of Barbie, etc.). She had a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale life-style that can be shared with affluent friends.&lt;ref&gt;Don Richard Cox, "Barbie and her playmates." ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 11.2 (1977): 303-307.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1987, Barbie has expanded into a [[media franchise]], including [[Barbie (film series)|animated films]], [[television special]]s, [[:Category:Barbie video games|video games]], and [[Barbie Girl|music]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:MattelBarbieno1br.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Barbie doll was introduced in both blonde and brunette in March 1959.]]
Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband [[Elliot Handler|Elliot]], a co-founder of the [[Mattel]] toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.

During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview with M.G.Lord, the author of ''Forever Barbie'', Ruth Handler said that she saw the doll in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, the book points out that on other occasions Handler said that she saw the doll in Zurich or Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;  The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a [[comic strip]] drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper ''[[Bild]]''. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Lilli, the High-end German Call Girl Who Became America’s Iconic Barbie Doll|url=http://www.messynessychic.com/2016/01/29/meet-lilli-the-high-end-german-call-girl-who-became-americas-iconic-barbie-doll/|website=Messy Nessy|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Upon her return to the United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from engineer [[Jack Ryan (designer)|Jack Ryan]]) and the doll was given a new name, ''Barbie'', after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in New York on March 9, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/mar/09/1959/ruth-mosko-handler | title=Ruth Mosko Handler unveils Barbie Doll | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date is also used as Barbie's official birthday.

The first Barbie doll wore a black and white [[zebra]] striped swimsuit and signature topknot [[ponytail]], and was available as either a [[blond]]e or [[Brown hair|brunette]]. The doll was marketed as a "Teen-age Fashion Model," with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese [[homeworker]]s. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production.

[[Louis Marx and Company]] sued Mattel in March 1961. After licensing Lilli, they claimed that Mattel had “infringed on Greiner &amp; Hausser's patent for Bild-Lilli’s hip joint, and also claimed that Barbie was "a direct take-off and copy" of Bild-Lilli. The company additionally claimed that Mattel "falsely and misleadingly represented itself as having originated the design". Mattel counter-claimed and the case was settled out of court in 1963. In 1964, Mattel bought Greiner &amp; Hausser's copyright and patent rights for the Bild-Lilli doll for $21,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toy monster: the big, bad world of Mattel|last = Oppenheimer|first = Jerry|publisher = Wiley|year = 2009|isbn = 007140211X|location = Hoboken, N.J.|pages = 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/23/business/fi-barbie23| title=Mattel Wins Ruling in Barbie Dispute | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Handler believed that it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, and early [[market research]] showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll's chest, which had distinct breasts. Barbie's appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll's eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model.

Barbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5370398.stm |work=BBC News | title=Vintage Barbie struts her stuff | date=September 22, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately [[1:6 scale modeling|1/6 scale]], which is also known as ''playscale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm |title=Playscale per About.com |publisher=Miniatures.about.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 23, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075027/http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm| archivedate= July 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard dolls are approximately 11½ inches tall.

==Media franchise==
{{See|Barbie (film series)}}

Barbie products include not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a large range of Barbie branded goods such as books, apparel, cosmetics, and [[:Category:Barbie video games|video games]]. Barbie has had a [[media franchise]] starting in 1987, when she began appearing in a [[Barbie (film series)|series of animated films]].

Barbie's [[direct-to-DVD]] animated films have sold more than {{formatnum:27 million}} units worldwide, as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brandweek |journal=[[Brandweek]] |date=April 2006 |volume=47 |issue=14-26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d74iAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=27+million |page=8 |publisher=[[Adweek]] |quote=To date, the Barbie brand's seven released, animated direct-to- DVDs have collectively sold more than 27 million units worldwide.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the brand has had two [[television special]]s, ''[[Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World]]'' and ''[[Barbie and the Sensations: Rockin' Back to Earth]]'', as well as a hit song, "[[Barbie Girl]]" (1997) by [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]. She is also a supporting character in the [[Pixar]] films ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.

==Legacy and influence==
Barbie has become a [[cultural icon]] and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of [[Times Square]] in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. The [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris]] at the Louvre held a Barbie exhibit in 2016.  The exhibit featured 700 Barbie dolls over two floors as well as works by contemporary artists and documents (newspapers, photos, video) that contextualize Barbie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musée des Arts Décoratifs|url=http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/en/exhibitions/current-events-1322/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/barbie/|website=Musée des Arts Décoratifs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the artist [[Andy Warhol]] created a painting of Barbie. The painting sold at auction at Christie’s, London for $1.1 million.  In 2015, The Andy Warhol Foundation then teamed up with Mattel to create an Andy Warhol Barbie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Limited Edition Andy Warhol Barbie Hits the Shelves|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/andy-warhol-barbie-doll-383987|website=Artnet|publisher=Artnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Hannah|title=Why Warhol painted Barbie|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34407991|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsider artist [[Al Carbee]] took thousands of photographs of Barbie and created countless collages and dioramas featuring Barbie in various settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gómez|first1=Edward|title=Al Carbee’s Art of Dolls and Yearning: "Oh, for a real, live Barbie!"|url=http://hyperallergic.com/125248/al-carbees-art-of-dolls-and-yearning-oh-for-a-real-live-barbie/|website=Hyperallergic|publisher=Hyperallergic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbee was the subject of the feature-length documentary [[Magical Universe]]. Carbee's collage art was presented in the 2016 Barbie exhibit at the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris]] in the section about visuals artists who have been inspired by Barbie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bender|first1=Silke|title=Widerlegt!

In 2013, in [[Taiwan]], the first Barbie-themed restaurant called "Barbie Café" opened under the Sinlaku group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2013\story_31-1-2013_pg9_1 |title=First Barbie-themed restaurant opens in Taiwan |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economist'' has emphasized the importance of Barbie to children's imagination:{{quote|From her early days as a teenage fashion model, Barbie has appeared as an astronaut, surgeon, Olympic athlete, downhill skier, aerobics instructor, TV news reporter, vet, rock star, doctor, army officer, air force pilot, summit diplomat, rap musician, presidential candidate (party undefined), baseball player, scuba diver, lifeguard, fire-fighter, engineer, dentist, and many more....When Barbie first burst into the toy shops, just as the 1960s were breaking, the doll market consisted mostly of babies, designed for girls to cradle, rock and feed. By creating a doll with adult features, Mattel enabled girls to become anything they want.&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'' 21 Dec 2002, Vol. 365 Issue 8304, pp 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===50th anniversary===

==Fictional biography==
{{See also|List of Barbie's friends and family}}
Barbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. In a series of novels published by [[Random House]] in the 1960s, her parents' names are given as George and Margaret Roberts from the fictional town of [[Willows, Wisconsin|Willows]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lawrence | first = Cynthia |author2=Bette Lou Maybee | title = Here's Barbie| publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 1962 | oclc = 15038159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Random House novels, Barbie attended Willows High School; while in the ''Generation Girl'' books, published by [[Western Publishing|Golden Books]] in 1999, she attended the fictional Manhattan International High School in New York City (based on the real-life [[Stuyvesant High School]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Marcia |last=Biederman |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/family/features/2033/ |title=Generation Next: A newly youthful Barbie takes Manhattan. |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=September 20, 1999 |accessdate=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has an on-off romantic relationship with her boyfriend [[Ken (doll)|Ken]] ("Ken Carson"), who first appeared in 1961. A [[Press release|news release]] from Mattel in February 2004 announced that Barbie and Ken had decided to split up,&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.shareholder.com/mattel/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=128705 The Storybook Romance Comes To An End For Barbie And Ken] Mattel February 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but in February 2006, they were hoping to rekindle their relationship after Ken had a makeover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/02/09/ken.barbie.reut/ Madeover Ken hopes to win back Barbie] CNN February 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbie has had over 40 pets including cats and dogs, horses, a [[Giant panda|panda]], a lion cub, and a [[zebra]]. She has owned a wide range of vehicles, including pink [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] [[convertible]]s, trailers, and [[Jeep]]s. She also holds a [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]]'s license, and operates commercial airliners in addition to serving as a [[flight attendant]].
[[Barbie's careers]] are designed to show that women can take on a variety of roles in life, and the doll has been sold with a wide range of titles including ''Miss Astronaut Barbie'' (1965), ''Doctor Barbie'' (1988), and ''Nascar Barbie'' (1998).

Mattel has created a range of companions for Barbie, including [[Hispanic]] [[Teresa (Barbie)|Teresa]], [[Midge (Barbie)|Midge]], African American Christie, and Steven (Christie's boyfriend). Barbie's siblings and cousins were also created including [[Skipper (Barbie)|Skipper]], [[List of Barbie's friends and family#Barbie family and other principal characters|Todd]] and [[List of Barbie's friends and family#Barbie family and other principal characters|Stacie]] (twin brother and sister), [[Kelly (Barbie)|Kelly]], [[Krissy (Barbie)|Krissy]], and [[Francie (Barbie)|Francie]].

==Controversy==
{{Redirect|Black Barbies|the Nicki Minaj song|Black Barbies (song)}}

'''Body Image'''

From the start, some have complained that "the blonde, plastic doll conveyed an unrealistic body image to girls."&lt;ref&gt;Ziobro, "Mattel to Add Curvy, Petite, Tall Barbies: Sales of the doll have fallen at double-digit rate for past eight quarters." ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]].&lt;ref&gt;Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive, "Does Barbie make girls want to be thin? The effect of experimental exposure to images of dolls on the body image of 5-to 8-year-old girls." ''Developmental psychology'' 42#2 (2006): 283.&lt;/ref&gt;   A standard Barbie doll is 11.5&amp;nbsp;inches tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9&amp;nbsp;inches at [[1:6 scale modeling|1/6 scale]]. Barbie's vital statistics have been estimated at 36&amp;nbsp;inches (chest), 18&amp;nbsp;inches (waist) and 33&amp;nbsp;inches (hips).

'''Diversity'''

Complaints also point to a lack of diversity in the line.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Tosa, ''Barbie: Four decades of fashion, fantasy, and fun'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mattel responded to these criticisms. Starting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced "Cinco de Mayo Barbie" wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress (echoing the Mexican flag). ''Hispanic'' magazine reports that:
{{quote|[O]ne of the most dramatic developments in Barbie's history came when she embraced multi-culturalism and was released in a wide variety of native costumes, hair colors and skin tones to more closely resemble the girls who idolized her. Among these were Cinco De Mayo Barbie, Spanish Barbie, Peruvian Barbie, Mexican Barbie and Puerto Rican Barbie. She also has had close Hispanic friends, such as Teresa.&lt;ref&gt;"A Barbie for Everyone" ''Hispanic'' (February–March 2009), Vol. 22, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Colored [[Francie (Barbie)|Francie]]" made her debut in 1967, and she is sometimes described as the first African American Barbie doll. However, she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked African characteristics other than a dark skin. The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercollector.com/articles/dolls/dollnews31301.shtml |title=African American Fashion Dolls of the 60s |publisher=Mastercollector.com |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822175140/http://www.mastercollector.com/articles/dolls/dollnews31301.shtml |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kattisdolls.net/faces/christie.htm |title=Faces of Christie |publisher=Kattisdolls.net |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091540/http://kattisdolls.net/faces/christie.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features. In 1990, Mattel created a focus group with African American children and parents, early childhood specialists, and clinical psychologist, Darlene Powell Hudson.  Instead of using the same molds for the Caucasian Barbies, new ones were created. In addition, facial features, skin tones, hair texture, and names were all altered. The body shapes looked different, but the proportions were the same to ensure clothing and accessories were interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ducille|first=Ann|date=1994|title=Dyes and Dolls: Multicultural Barbie and the merchandising of difference|url=|journal=A Journal of Feminist of Cultural Studies|volume=6|pages=46|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2009, Mattel introduced the [[List of Barbie's friends and family#S.I.S./So In Style characters|So In Style]] range, which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of African American people than previous dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,562706,00.html |title=Mattel introduces black Barbies, to mixed reviews |publisher=Fox News |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011234536/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C562706%2C00.html |archivedate=October 11, 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Mattel expanded this line to include seven skin tones, twenty-two eye colors, and twenty-four hairstyles.

Mattel teamed up with [[Nabisco]] to launch a cross-promotion of Barbie with [[Oreo]] [[cookie]]s.  ''Oreo Fun Barbie'' was marketed as someone with whom young girls could play after class and share "America's favorite cookie." As had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a [[White people|white]] and a [[Black people|black]] version. Critics argued that in the African American community, ''Oreo'' is a derogatory term meaning that the person is "black on the outside and white on the inside," like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself. The doll was unsuccessful and Mattel recalled the unsold stock, making it sought after by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authentichistory.com/diversity/african/images/2001_Oreo_Barbie.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012041355/http://www.authentichistory.com/diversity/african/images/2001_Oreo_Barbie.html|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, Mattel introduced ''Share a Smile Becky'', a doll in a pink [[wheelchair]]. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old high school student in [[Tacoma, Washington]] with [[cerebral palsy]], pointed out that the doll would not fit into the [[elevator]] of Barbie's $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html|title=Barbie's Disabled Friend Can't Fit|agency=Associated Press|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=November 6, 2010|location=EL SEGUNDO, Calif.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001040037/http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html| archivedate= October 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallery.bcentral.com/GID4729088P1681774-COLLECTIBLES/BARBIE/SHARE-A-SMILE-BECKY.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617002332/http://gallery.bcentral.com/GID4729088P1681774-COLLECTIBLES/BARBIE/SHARE-A-SMILE-BECKY.aspx |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Bad Influence Concerns'''

In July 1992, Mattel released ''[[Teen Talk Barbie]]'', which spoke a number of phrases including "Will we ever have enough clothes?", "I love shopping!", and "Wanna have a pizza party?"  Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two given dolls were likely to be the same. One of these 270 phrases was "Math class is tough!". Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it led to criticism from the [[American Association of University Women]]. In October 1992, Mattel announced that ''Teen Talk Barbie'' would no longer say the phrase, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/21/business/company-news-mattel-says-it-erred-teen-talk-barbie-turns-silent-on-math.html?scp=1|title=COMPANY NEWS: Mattel Says It Erred; Teen Talk Barbie Turns Silent on Math|date=October 21, 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, the Middle Eastern country of [[Saudi Arabia]] outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls, saying that she did not conform to the ideals of Islam. The [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]] stated "Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, [[fashion accessory|accessories]] and tools are a symbol of decadence to the [[Perversion|perverted]] West.

Fulla is not manufactured by the Mattel Corporation (although Mattel still licenses Fulla dolls and franchises for sale in some countries), and the "Jewish" Barbie dolls are still available in other [[Sunni Islam|Muslim]]-majority countries including [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/797/li1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Living &amp;#124; Move over, Barbie|date=June 7, 2006|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513181613/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/797/li1.htm|archivedate=May 13, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Iran]], [[Sara and Dara dolls]], introduced in March 2002, are available as an alternative to Barbie, even though they have not been as successful as Barbie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1856558.stm|title=Muslim dolls tackle 'wanton' Barbie|date=March 5, 2002|work=BBC News|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the launch of a ''Totally Tattoos Barbie'' with a range of [[tattoo]]s that could be applied to the doll, including a [[lower-back tattoo]], led to controversy. Mattel's promotional material read "Customize the fashions and apply the fun temporary tattoos on you too", but Ed Mayo, chief executive of Consumer Focus, argued that children might want to get tattooed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1175039/Chav-Barbie-gets-tattoos-mimic-high-profile-celebs-like-Amy-Winehouse.html|title=Barbie given tattoos by makers to mimic high-profile celebrities like Amy Winehouse|author=Sean Poulter|date=April 30, 2009|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=May 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110605145201/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1175039/Chav-Barbie-gets-tattoos-mimic-high-profile-celebs-like-Amy-Winehouse.html|archivedate=June 5, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Mattel received criticism over the book ''[[Computer Engineer Barbie|I Can Be a Computer Engineer]]'', which depicted Barbie as being inept at computers and requiring that her two male friends complete all of the necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she downloads a virus onto both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/barbie-f-cks-it-up-again-1660326671|title=Barbie F*cks It Up Again|last1=Ribon|first1=Pamela|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics complained that the book was sexist, as other books in the ''I Can Be...'' series depicted Barbie as someone who was competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/barbie-engineer-book-girls-game-developers/|title=Barbie book about programming tells girls they need boys to code for them|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|publisher=Daily Dot|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattel later removed the book from sale on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in response to the criticism.&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/mattel-pulls-sexist-barbie-book-i-can-be-a-computer-engineer-off-amazon/|title=Mattel Pulls Sexist Barbie Book "I Can Be A Computer Engineer" Off Amazon|last1=Buhr|first1=Sarah|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety Concerns'''

In March 2000, stories appeared in the media claiming that the hard [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] used in vintage Barbie dolls could leak toxic chemicals, causing danger to children playing with them. The claim was described as an overreaction by Joseph Prohaska, a professor at the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]]. A modern Barbie doll has a body made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic, while the head is made from soft [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectdolls.about.com/library/ucbarbieresponse.htm |title=Kiss That Barbie!

In July 2010, Mattel released "Barbie Video Girl", a Barbie doll with a pinhole video camera in its chest, enabling clips of up to 30 minutes to be recorded, viewed, and uploaded to a computer via a [[USB]] cable. On November 30, 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] issued a warning in a private memo that the doll could be used to produce [[child pornography]], although it stated publicly that there was "no reported evidence that the doll had been used in any way other than intended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11930727 |work=BBC News | title=FBI memo raises Barbie child pornography fears | date=December 6, 2010 | accessdate=December 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101208044552/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11930727| archivedate= December 8, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/03/fbi.barbie.porn/ |publisher=CNN | title=FBI: New Barbie 'Video Girl' doll could be used for child porn | date=December 4, 2010 | accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, concerns were raised about a version of the doll called "Hello Barbie", which can hold conversations with a child using [[speech recognition]] technology. The doll transmits data back to a service called ToyTalk, which according to ''[[Forbes]]'', has a terms of service and privacy policy that allow it to “share audio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition,” and states that “recordings and photos may also be used for research and development purposes, such as to improve speech recognition technology and artificial intelligence algorithms and create better entertainment experiences.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2015/03/20/this-new-toy-records-your-childrens-private-moments-buyer-beware/ |work=Forbes | title=This New Toy Records Your Children's Private Moments -- Buyer Beware | date=March 20, 2015 | accessdate=March 20, 2015 |author=Joseph Steinberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting==
Mattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year. Forty-five percent of them spend upwards of $1000 a year.
Vintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at [[auction]], and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on [[eBay]] in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=6539&amp;si=123|title=1959 Blonde Ponytail Barbie Brings Over $3,000!|date=October 16, 2004|work=Scoop|accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 [[pound sterling|sterling]]  (US $17,000) at [[Christie's]] in London.

In recent years, Mattel has sold a wide range of Barbie dolls aimed specifically at collectors, including [[porcelain]] versions, vintage reproductions, and depictions of Barbie as a range of characters from film and television series such as ''[[The Munsters]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=1001084&amp;t=modern |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173241/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=1001084&amp;t=modern |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=150303&amp;t=modern |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173251/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=150303&amp;t=modern |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also collector's edition dolls depicting Barbie dolls with a range of different ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/gallery.aspx?t=modern&amp;y=tmp1 |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173304/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/gallery.aspx?t=modern&amp;y=tmp1 |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Mattel introduced the Color Tier system for its collector's edition Barbie dolls including pink, silver, gold, and platinum, depending on how many of the dolls are produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbiecollector.com/collecting/tiers/ BarbieCollector.com – Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828201824/http://www.barbiecollector.com/collecting/tiers/ |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition from Bratz dolls==
In June 2001, [[MGA Entertainment]] launched the [[Bratz]] series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although [[Mattel]] maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3640958.stm |work=BBC News | title=Bratz topple Barbie from top spot | date=September 9, 2004 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4350846.stm |work=BBC News | title=Barbie blues for toy-maker Mattel | date=October 17, 2005 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, researchers Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive conducted an experiment testing how dolls, including Barbie, effect self-image in young girls. Dittmar, Halliwell, and Ive gave picture books to girls age 5&amp;ndash;8, one with photos of Barbie and the other with photos of Emme, a doll with more realistic physical features. The girls were then asked about their ideal body size. Their research found that the girls who were exposed to the images of Barbie had significantly lower self-esteem than the girls who had photos of Emme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dittmar, Halliwell, Ive|first=Helga, Emma, Suzanne|date=2006|title=Does Barbie Make Girls Want to Be Thin?

'''''Barrel of Monkeys''''' is a [[toy]] game released by Lakeside Toys in 1965. It was created by Leonard Marks and Milton Dinhofer in 1961, and in 1964, Herman Kesler partnered to sell it to Lakeside Toys.  Lakeside Toys released it in 1965 and today it is produced by the [[Milton Bradley Company]] within the [[Hasbro]] corporation.  Milton Bradley's editions consist of a toy [[barrel]] in either blue, yellow, red, purple, orange, gray or green.  The barrel contains 12 [[monkey]]s but can hold 24, their color usually corresponding to the barrel's color.  The instructions state, "Dump monkeys onto table.  Pick up one monkey by an arm.  Hook other arm through a second monkey's arm.  Continue making a chain.  Your turn is over when a monkey is dropped."  In addition to these basic instructions, the barrel also contains instructions for playing alone or with two or more players.

''Time'' magazine ranked ''Barrel of Monkeys'' at #53 on their 2011 ''All-Time 100 Greatest Toys'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All-TIME 100 Greatest Toys - TIME |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048656_2049099,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=2011-02-16 |access-date=2015-10-22 |issn=0040-781X |first=Allie |last=Townsend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1961, a greeting cards salesman, Leonard Marks, was in a small mom-and-pop shop to sell his line of cards.  As he waited for Robert Gilbert, the shop owner, he fiddled with an open box of snow tire replacement chain links.  Marks was so interested in playing, he hadn’t realized so much time had passed.  When he told Gilbert that the links would make a great toy, Gilbert referred Marks to a successful local toy inventor, Milton Dinhofer.  Marks already knew Dinhofer from his high school days and immediately reached out to his old friend.  Dinhofer asked Marks to bring him a plastic sample of the hooks to their meeting.

At the time, Milton Dinhofer was a graduate of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] and a successful importer.  Prior to meeting with Marks, Dinhofer already had two major toy achievements to his credit.  He created the first full-size wearable toy space helmet.  The helmet made the covers of both ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (November 8, 1952) and ''[[Collier's|Collier’s]]'' magazine (April 18, 1953).  He also designed and brought to market Sip-n-See.  Sip-n-See was the first plastic [[drinking straw]] on the market and the first twisted straw, selling over 5 million pieces.  The straws had different characters on them, and it was the cowboy character’s s-shaped arms that would inspire the shape of the monkeys.

When Marks met Dinhofer at his home in [[Roslyn, New York]], he brought a pile of red s-shaped 1/4” rod plastic hooks.  Dinhofer immediately imagined monkeys and envisioned them with arms like those on his cowboy straw.  Marks and Dinhofer agreed to form a partnership that night.  It was decided that Dinhofer would design the toy, and Marks would sell it.  It then took Dinhofer three months to go from sketch to functional monkey.  He made a sketch for a face and one for a body.  The biggest challenge was the monkeys' balance.  Once that was achieved, Dinhofer hired A. Santore of A. S. Plastic Model Company to carve a sample under his supervision.  Dinhofer took Santore's sample to a company that could make a beryllium mold of it.  Finding a mold maker was quite a challenge and very expensive, as working with [[plastic]] was still relatively new.  The initial run of monkeys were in many assorted colors, but their shape was just like those that Lakeside would release in 1965.  (Lakeside would eventually add a little more hair to the bodies.)  [[File:Chimp_to_Chimp.jpg|thumb|Barrel of Monkeys (game)]]Marks and Dinhofer named their game Chimp to Chimp and chose three colors for their monkeys - four were yellow, four were green and four were red.   Twelve total monkeys allowed three to twelve year old children to link them without needing to stand on stools.  The Chimp to Chimp prototype came in a flat expensive-to-make packaging, which the [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] chain offered to carry in their stores.  Woolworths stipulated that Marks and Dinhofer must provide 13 weeks of television advertising.  Neither Dinhofer nor Marks could afford a television advertising campaign, and there were no other buyers found.  It seemed the game would never come to market.  Then in 1964, Herman Kesler agreed to join the partnership and pitch Barrel of Monkeys to Lakeside Toys where he had connections.

In 1964, Kesler called Zelman Levine, the CEO and President of Lakeside Toys for a meeting.  They met in November of that year at the [[JW Marriott Essex House|Essex House]] New York City.  Also present were Lakeside's vice president, James R. Becker, who would eventually become president, and Stanley Harfenist, Lakeside’s future General Manager who was in the process of bringing [[Gumby]] to Lakeside.  Kesler walked into Levine’s room, dropped the monkeys on the table, and began to link them together.  Becker said the phrase, “more fun than a barrel of monkeys” was brought up at that meeting by Becker himself.  Levine immediately approved the toy and took all the samples back with him to his headquarters in Minneapolis.  ''Barrel of Monkeys'' was quickly released in 1965 as a Lakeside toy allowing Marks, Dinhofer and Kesler to receive ongoing royalties. ''Barrel of Monkeys'' initially came in a cardboard tube with a plastic monkey attached to the lid.  This tube packaging was similar to Lakeside’s already successful [[Pick-up sticks|Pick-Up-Sticks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Tale More Fun Than A Barrel Of Monkeys|last = Leshay|first = Tracy|date = February 2015|journal = The Toy Book|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 31| issue =  1|pages = 250–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Monkey Business|last = |first = |date = Spring 2015|journal = Rensselaer Alumni Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.liveauctioneers.com/news/features/freelancewriter/barrel-of-monkeys-opens-up-about-turning-50/|title = An American Classic, Barrel Of Monkeys Opens Up About Turning 50|date = December 24, 2014|accessdate = |website = LiveAuctioneers|publisher = |last = Leshay|first = Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1967, Barrel of Monkeys in a plastic barrel was #2 on ''Toy and Hobby World’s'' Toy Hit Parade chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Toy Hit Parade|last = |first = |date = April 3, 1967|journal = Toy &amp; Hobby World|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially sold in a [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] tube, Lakeside quickly produced a two-piece plastic barrel that completely replaced the cardboard version by 1966.  Unlike the later mono-colored ''Giant Barrel of Monkeys'', this original version included 12 plastic monkeys in three colors; four each in red, blue and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The current Hasbro version is sold with ten monkeys in the barrel.

==Use in models==
These Monkeys have also been used for modeling of [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] structures, including [[virus]] particles and other [[protein]] structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=N. Michael |last=Green |coauthors= |title=Monkeys Ape Molecules |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/monkey_molecules |work=Nature (London) Vol.217 |pages= |accessdate=2007-06-21 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211150151/http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/monkey_molecules/ |archivedate=2007-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In brief, a pair of monkeys can hook around each other in more than eighty different ways, forming quite stable links.  The links may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical.   Repetition of an asymmetric link  generates a [[helix]]. A symmetric link is self-limiting, so that the structure cannot grow further unless a new link is used to join symmetric pairs.  It is possible to generate structures with point, line, 2D or 3D symmetry by choosing two or three different links (from the 80 or more possibilities) and repeating them systematically.  An enormous number of compatible combinations can be found by trial and error. Many are shown in the sources quoted above.

Any repeating unit can in principle be assembled in this way. The only unusual characteristic of the monkey is that its arms, legs, hands and feet are able to twist around each other to form many stable links. In this, they resemble protein molecules which can also link together in many ways. The resulting assemblies simulate biologically important structures, but their symmetry follows general geometric principles.  The monkeys provide a 'hands on' approach to understanding these principles.
''Barrel of Monkeys'' is also called as '''''Bandar Keela''''' and is famous in south Asian countries.

==Gameplay==
[[File:CastlevaniaLoDScreenshot.JPG|thumb|left|Cornell confronts a "Knight" enemy. ''Legacy of Darkness'' features [[3D computer graphics|3D]] gameplay.|alt=A ragged man engages in sword combat with a haunted suit of armor. The octagonal room is dim with crimson walls and a wooden checkered floor, and is adorned by a golden door, two stone gargoyles, and another suit of armor.]]
A large part of the game's challenge is based on jumping from platform to platform while avoiding environmental hazards, such as enemies and traps. Platforms are usually stationary, but some may rotate out from under the player, move through the environment like a rail shooter (the gondola in the Tunnel level), and crumble or fall away underfoot. There are also some invisible platforms that either afford players a strategic advantage or lead to hidden items.

Castlevania also includes elements from the survival horror game genre. In addition to the trappings and narrative devices of Gothic horror, players are often placed in situations that evoke feelings of stress, anxiety, and vulnerability. Players may be trapped in caged fights with monsters, such as the battle with the Cerberus hounds in the Villa when the screen darkens to near-black. Some caged battles are timed, such as the boss battles in the Duel Tower level, where the gamer will be crushed by a falling ceiling should they not best their enemy in time. Vampires are also often fought in caged environments, with the added complication that they can latch onto Carrie, Cornell, Henry and Reinhardt to suck their blood. If the player doesn't break free by rapidly rotating the control stick, the character's status changes to "vamp" and they will not be able to use their primary weapon or healing items. Unless a specific item is used to recover, the game becomes exponentially more challenging. Castlevania also features two high-stakes survival horror sequences: In the Villa's maze garden, players must help Henry through the labyrinthine hedges while strong, unbeatable enemies give chase. In the Castle Center, players must carefully carry the "magic nitro" item through a nerve-wracking obstacle course to its destination. One fall or hit can cause the volatile chemical to explode, resulting in immediate death.

==Plot==
Set in the year 1844, the game stars the man-beast Cornell in his quest to prevent his adoptive sister, Ada, from being used as a sacrifice to resurrect [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]. The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle.

During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. [[Gilles de Rais]] and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to ''Castlevania'' to save kidnapped children.

Throughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega. Ortega has allied himself with Dracula to finally beat Cornell in combat, turning into a chimera like creature. They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers. Unbeknownst to the hero, acquiring this power was the true aim of the dark forces, as it was the perfect sacrifice (not Ada, as Cornell had assumed) to resurrect Dracula at his full power.

==Development==
''Legacy of Darkness'' was a continuation of Konami's first attempt (''Castlevania'', also published in 1999) to create a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] ''Castlevania''. The game more fully realizes the game designers' vision. For example, Cornell was present in early development media and press information for ''Castlevania'', but was ultimately removed before the game's release.

''Legacy'''s primary focus is on a new story (a [[prequel]] to Carrie and Reinhardt's adventures) in which Cornell explores new levels, as well as redesigned levels from [[Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania 64]].  Levels from [[Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania 64]] that have not been drastically changed (such as the Villa) are often navigated in a new or novel manner and feature different puzzles. Completing the game once unlocks Henry's quest, and he explores his own set of levels and new bosses, many are newly redesigned levels based on the levels of Castlevania 64 as well.

Carrie and Reinhardt's quests are a secondary focus (bonus features), that can only be unlocked after completing both Cornell and Henry's quests. Carrie and Reinhardt's quests lack the voice acting, some cutscenes and the original level designs present in ''Castlevania 64'' (due to space concerns), instead adopting the new level designs (from Cornell and Henry's quests). Their quests also feature new bosses from Henry's quest, such as [[Medusa]] and the Queen of the Spider. They are also given new armor and weapon designs, though the original starting armor from Castlevania 64 can be unlocked during Henry's quest.

In ''Legacy'' control of the game's characters, camera, and frame-rate were streamlined. The game also supports the Nintendo 64's [[Expansion Pak]] add-on, which allows for an option in which textures are displayed in a higher resolution. However, this mode have some frame-rate issues. ''Legacy of Darkness'' also features several minor additions, such as an alternate costume for Cornell and new alternate costumes for Carrie and Reinhardt (their original costumes from ''Castlevania 64'').

''Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness'' was present within the series' original chronology from its original release until 2002, when a timeline published on the official Japanese ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance]]'' website omitted it – as well as several other ''Castlevania'' games – from the series' continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/CV01/chronology.html|title=CASTLEVANIA|accessdate=2007-05-19|year=2002|publisher=[[Konami]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others also included ''[[Castlevania Legends]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Castlevania: Circle of the Moon]]'' and the original ''Castlevania'' release for the [[Nintendo 64]].

In 2006, series producer [[Koji Igarashi]] stated that "These games were taken out of the timeline [...] not because I didn't work on them, but because they were considered by their directors to be side projects in the series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&amp;cId=3152109|title=Tales from The Crypt: Castlevania's 20th Anniversary Blow-Out|accessdate=2007-05-19|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|date=2006-07-26|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215534/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&amp;cId=3152109|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2002 removal, the events of ''Legacy of Darkness'' have occupied an ambiguous place in timelines published by Konami of Japan, Konami of America, and various gaming publications. The most recent English language timeline, distributed with preordered versions of ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' in North America by Konami of America, includes Legacy of Darkness but does not describe the game's plot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/314073086/in/set-72157594405290664/ Image of the most recent English language timeline.]&lt;/ref&gt; IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as "...a Castlevania "gaiden" (subseries)" and complimented them by stating "...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world."&lt;ref&gt;Nintendo Power, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

IGA later reincorporated the games into his timeline, and included Cornell as a playable character in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008). The game included references to the plot and elements from the game including Cornell's sister Ada and his clan. Chronologically speaking his appearance in Castlevania Judgement is set before the events of Legacy of Darkness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">A '''court usher''' is a position in a law [[court]]. Tasks generally performed by court ushers involve escorting participants to the [[courtroom]],&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; and seeing that they are suitably  hydrated, as well as ensuring the secure transaction of legal documents within the courtroom and deciding the order of cases.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt; The roles of an usher may vary with the type of court they serve. In Scottish courts the position is called "court officer" or "bar officer" or, for the higher courts, the "macer".&lt;ref name="Scotland" /&gt;

'''''Davis Cup Tennis''''' is a [[sports game]] developed by [[Loriciel]] in 1991 for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] and then by [[Hokus Pokus Games]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It was released in the United States in 1991 on the TurboGrafx-16 and again for the [[Game Boy Advance]] on October 15, 2002. It is the North American port of [[Tennis Cup]], previously released in 1989 on micro-computers.

In the GBA version's two [[game mode]]s, the player assumes control of either a [[tennis]] player during a single match or an entire country's team in the [[Davis Cup]], an international competition. [[Multiplayer]] is supported through the [[Game Link Cable|link cable]]. The game garnered mixed reviews from critics, who overall felt that it paled in comparison to 2002's ''[[Virtua Tennis]]'' and earlier versions of ''[[Mario Tennis]]''.

==Gameplay==
The game follows the rules of [[tennis]] closely. Each [[tennis match|match]] has a minimum of 5 sets by default.&lt;ref name="GameSpy"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Players are able to control the difficulty of the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] before starting their game as well.&lt;ref name="GameSpy" /&gt; The player can either choose to play a "Quick Play" mode which allows for a single tennis match, or to play through the full [[Davis Cup]], where the player must choose the team captain and compete through the entire tournament with the rotating player rotation.&lt;ref name="GameSpy" /&gt;

The tennis players are represented by [[two-dimensional]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], while the [[tennis court|court]] is given the illusion of being [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]].&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Players are able to control the power of their initial serve, but cannot control how hard they hit balls already in play.&lt;ref name="GameSpy" /&gt;

''Davis Cup Tennis'' garnered mixed reviews from gaming press, who felt that the game was lackluster compared to ''[[Virtua Tennis]]''. [[GameSpot]]'s Frank Provo and [[IGN]]'s Craig Harris both criticized the lack of an in-game save option that you could activate during your match, with Craig Harris remarking that the design "isn't exactly handheld friendly".&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Frank Provo felt that the larger variety of techniques found in ''Virtua Tennis'' made it "the better option".&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt; [[GameSpy]]'s Avi Fryman remarked on the game's averageness in comparison to its competitors, commenting "... if all available copies of ''Virtua Tennis'' and ''Mario Tennis'' suddenly vaporized, there might be a reason for casual gamers to pick this one up."&lt;ref name="GameSpy" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5481">'''Figure and ground''' is a concept drawn from [[Gestalt psychology]] by [[media studies|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] in the early 1970s. This concept underpins the meaning of his famous phrase, "[[The medium is the message]]". The concept was an approach to what was called "perceptual organization." He began to use the terms figure and ground as a way "to describe the parts of a situation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/mcluhan/probe/fg/probe_fg.html|title=CIOS/McLuhan Site: Probe: Figure &amp; Ground|website=www.cios.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and "to help explain his ideas about media and human communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The concept was later employed to explain how a communications technology, the medium or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

To McLuhan, "‘figure’ refers to something that jumps out at us, something that grabs our attention, [whereas] ‘ground’ refers to something that supports or contextualizes a situation and is usually an area of unattention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" When we first experience a new image or sensation, there are certain aspects of the object that grab our attention and engage us and certain aspects that we unintentionally ignore. We should not focus on just the "figure" or the "ground" though, as McLuhan believed that both were equally as important to understanding the full meaning of the situation. "This distinction between that which is perceived and that which is blocked out in order to focus perception is central for McLuhan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/mcluhan_latour.html|title=Felix Stalder: McLuhan and Latour|website=felix.openflows.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

McLuhan used different words to describe the figure/ground relationship, sometimes using content for figure and environment or, more often, medium for ground.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"McLuhan looked at media through a figure/ground relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" To him, people tended to focus on only specific parts of the media, and disregard other parts. "To examine the total effect of any medium, McLuhan pointed out that we need to look at both figure AND ground, and their relationship to one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" He believed that "only focusing on the ‘content’ of the media was like looking at figures without examining their ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" "The ground, or environment, is not a passive container, but active processes that influence the relationships between all of the elements in it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;"

McLuhan believed that to fully grasp the impact of a new technology in regard to figure (medium) and ground (context),&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; one must understand that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Neither piece is definitive without the other. His ''[[Understanding Media]]'' explores different grounds as they are structured by different media including print, radio, and television.

[[Al Held]], a well-known artist, exemplifies this idea in one of his paintings. The work is called The Big N and it "provides us with an introduction to the concepts of figure and ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" Looking at a glance, you might draw your attention to the black triangles. "Once you were given the name of the painting, however, the frame became linked to the figures, and an 'N' suddenly appeared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" In understanding the work, it is important to look at the bigger picture. Al Held’s painting is well-known for its display of framing, or context, and its importance to the meaning of the overall situation. If either the frame or the painting itself were to change, the interpretation of the work might shift. Pertaining to media, we must look at both the figure and the ground to "understand [its] effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The ground which media creates gives a context for human communication, and thus "directs human action in unique and important ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;"

McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to those technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in turn, further shapes societies and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Furthermore, all technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. Again, the message conveyed by the medium can only be understood if the medium is concurrently analyzed with the environment in which it is used — and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates. McLuhan believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Alternately, the idea of "figure" can also refer to content of a particular medium, while "ground" refers to the medium itself. McLuhan's aphorism "[[The medium is the message]]" can thus be read as an attempt to draw attention away from a preoccupation with the figure/message to a consideration of the importance of the ground/medium.

'''Follow the leader''' is a [[children's game]]. First a leader or "head of the line" is chosen, then the children all line up behind the ''leader''.  The leader then moves around and all the children have to mimic the leader's actions. Any players who fail to follow or do what the leader does are out of the game. When only one person other than the leader remains, that player becomes the leader, and the game begins again with all players joining the line once again.

== Other versions ==
In 2007, The Wiggles wrote a song "Follow the Leader" about the game for The Wiggles'  album ''Getting Strong (Wiggle and Learn)''. The song was available on DVD in The Wiggles' You Make Me Feel Like Dancing.

'''''Freddy vs. Jason''''' (alternatively known as '''''A Nightmare on Friday the 13th''''') is a 2003 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Ronny Yu]] and written by [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon|Damian Shannon and Mark Swift]]. The film is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] between ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series, and pits [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]] against each other in the eighth and eleventh installments in their respective series. The film is also the last in both ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''Friday the 13th'' series before they were both [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].

In the film, Freddy ([[Robert Englund]]) has grown incapable of haunting people's dreams as the citizens of Springwood, Ohio, have mostly forgotten about him following his death and subsequent imprisonment in [[Hell]] for his sins. To regain his power and freedom, Freddy resurrects Jason ([[Ken Kirzinger]]) and manipulates him into traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear, leading to rumors that Freddy has returned. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, Jason angers Freddy by depriving him of potential victims. This ultimately sends the two undead monsters into a violent conflict.

''Freddy vs. Jason'' was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. It grossed $114 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series and the second-highest-grossing film in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' series. It is however the second highest grossing film in the Friday the 13th series but the highest grossing film in the A Nightmare on Elm Street series with $174 million when adjusted for inflation. The film is Englund's final canonical appearance as Freddy Krueger, though he did appear as the character in an episode of ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3527995/adam-f-goldberg-tells-story-got-robert-englund-play-freddy-krueger-goldbergs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries must be generic and WITHIN 400-700 WORDS!!! As of 14 August 2016, this summary has over 435 words: IT IS STRONGLY REQUIRED TO NOT EXPAND ANY FURTHER!!!! --&gt;

In September 2003, Four Years After ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare|The Final Nightmare]]'' And Three Months After ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday|The Final Friday]]'', [[Freddy Krueger]] is rendered powerless in Hell because the people of Springwood manage to make the youth forget about him. Disguised as [[Pamela Voorhees]], Freddy manipulates [[Jason Voorhees]] into coming back to life and start killing Springwood teenagers to generate fear of Freddy's presumed return. In Springwood, [[Lori Campbell]] lives with her widowed father and has her friends Kia Waterson, Gibb Smith, Trey, and Blake staying over. That night, Jason kills Trey, and the police suspect Freddy, fearing his return. Following a [[nightmare]] where Freddy tries to kill Blake but fails due to not being powerful enough, Blake awakens to find his father beheaded before Jason kills him as well. The next day, police claim it to be a [[murder–suicide]], hoping to contain Freddy.

Lori's ex-boyfriend Will Rollins and friend Mark Davis are patients at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital. They take Hypnocil to suppress their dreams due to previous contact with Freddy. A news report about the murders motivate Mark and Will to escape and return to Springwood in order to warn Lori about Freddy. That night, Lori and the others attend a [[rave]] at a [[Cereal|cornfield]]. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her in the real world along with several other attendees, which causes Freddy to realize that Jason's rampage will deny him victims.

Charlie Linderman and Bill Freeburg escape the rave along with Will, Lori, and Kia. Later, Will explains to Lori that the reason he was sent to Westin Hills was because he saw her father murder her mother, before going to Mark's house.  However, they discover Freddy killing Mark and leaving a message on his body that declares his return. Deputy Scott Stubbs approaches Lori and her friends, who realize Freddy's plan and convince him of the truth. Learning of Hypnocil, they attempt to steal it from Westin Hills and see many teenagers in a coma-like-state due to prolonged Hypnocil use, but Freddy possesses Freeburg and disposes of the medicine. Having followed them, Jason electrocutes Stubbs to death but is tranquilized by a possessed Freeburg, whom Jason kills before falling asleep.

Taking Jason's body with them, the teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason. They take the unconscious Jason to the now abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Freddy battles Jason in the dream world. where Freddy has the advantage due to his dream powers. Freddy learns that Jason is afraid of water (a plot device that contradicts earlier ''Friday the 13th'' films with the exception of "Jason Takes Manhattan") and uses this fear to render Jason powerless. Meanwhile, Lori goes to sleep and tries to save Jason. Freddy attacks her and reveals himself as her mother's killer, having possessed her father to do it.

Jason awakens at Camp Crystal Lake and chases the teens into a cabin. Linderman is killed after trying to fight Jason and the cabin ignites. Lori is awakened and manages to pull Freddy into the real world where he is confronted by Jason. As the two begin to fight, the remaining teens escape the cabin.

Freddy escapes Jason and goes after the teens, but he is distracted by Kia—until Jason suddenly kills her. The two killers resume their battle until they reach a dock on the lake, where Freddy stabs Jason's eyes, and Jason tears off Freddy's clawed arm. Lori and Will attempt to kill the two by pouring gasoline on the dock and setting it ablaze. Some propane tanks explode nearby, blasting Jason and Freddy into the lake. Freddy climbs out and attempts to kill Lori and Will, but is impaled by Jason with his own clawed arm before the latter falls back into the lake. Lori decapitates Freddy, avenging the deaths of her friends and her mother. Freddy's body falls into the lake and sinks to the bottom. Lori and Will leave Camp Crystal Lake as the only survivors.

The next day, Jason emerges from the water, holding his [[machete]] and Freddy's severed head. However, Freddy winks to the audience before laughing off-screen.

===Development===
Influenced by fans' desire for a crossover film depicting a fight between the two icons, New Line and Paramount tried to make a ''Freddy vs. Jason'' movie in 1987. But the two studios failed to agree on a story. When ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' failed to perform successfully at the box office, Sean Cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire the rights to ''Friday the 13th'' and start working with New Line Cinema on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', as New Line owned ''Nightmare on Elm Street''. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new; Paramount had approached New Line about filming a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to ''Friday the 13th''. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make ''The New Blood''. After ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' was released in 1989 the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', Wes Craven returned to New Line to make ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]''. This effectively put ''Freddy vs. Jason'' on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with ''Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday''.&lt;ref name="part9"&gt;Bracke, Peter, pp.218–219&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth installment "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger, rather than start a new series for New Line.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke, Peter, pg. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham's "frustration" with the delayed development of the ''Freddy vs. Jason'' project forced him to create another sequel titled ''[[Jason X]]'' in an effort to keep the series in the minds of audiences. Based on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''{{'}}s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film would put the titular character in space.&lt;ref name="part 10"&gt;Bracke, Peter, pp.242–243&lt;/ref&gt; The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002; it would go on to become the lowest grossing film in the series at the domestic box office; it also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Bracke, Peter, pp.263–264&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writers Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, several endings were considered for the film. One of the unused endings involved [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] of the ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' franchise; however, New Line was discontent with securing the rights to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thurman |first=Trace |date=13 May 2016 |title=Hockey Masks, Machetes and Razor Fingers: The Writers Behind ‘Freddy Vs.

Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing [[Kane Hodder]] was the best choice for the role.&lt;ref name="Ken"&gt;Bracke, Peter, pp. 280–286&lt;/ref&gt; Hodder did receive the script for ''Freddy vs. Jason'', and had a meeting with director [[Ronny Yu]] and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt; According to Hodder, New Line didn't provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films.&lt;ref name="Hiring Ken"&gt;Grove, David, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The role eventually went to [[Ken Kirzinger]], a Canadian stuntman who worked on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''. There are conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than [[Robert Englund]], the actor who portrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands 6' 5" (196&amp;nbsp;cm), compared to the 6' 3" (191&amp;nbsp;cm) of [[Kane Hodder]]. Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over the 5' 9" (175&amp;nbsp;cm) Englund. Kirzinger believes his experience on ''Part VIII'' helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled for Hodder on two scenes for the film,&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt; but also believes he was simply sized up and handed the job.&lt;ref name="Hiring Ken"/&gt; Although he was hired by the crew, New Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film. Kirzinger's first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a specific movement in Jason's walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed a contract with the studio.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;

Douglas Tait portrayed Jason for a reshot ending.&lt;ref name="fridaythe13thfilms1"/&gt; In an interview, Tait explained the reason for the reshoot saying, "Unfortunately for me, it was the only scene I was hired to do. The test audiences were confused about the original ending, they thought Jason Ritter’s character was becoming {{sic|Jason}}. You can see it in the deleted scenes, that is why they decided to reshoot the ending. Originally I was being considered for playing the role of Jason in the entire film. It was actually between me and Ken. When they took the film to Canada, I was out of luck. There was no way they were going to pay for my flight and hotel stay when Ken was a local. Also, Ken is older than me and he was a lot more established in the business than I was at the time."&lt;ref name="fridaythe13thfilms1"&gt;[http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ Interview: Douglas Tait (Jason Voorhees, ‘Freddy vs Jason’)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016100323/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ |date=2010-10-16 }} fridaythe13thfilms.com October 14, 2010. Retrieved April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the scene, Tait said "I was on the film for a couple days. The water sequence took a lot of preparation. They realized that when I got wet, I looked too skinny in the clothes, so they had to bulk me up with pads and extra clothing so it would look like I was still big. Being with all this extra weight, one eye covered, a machete in one hand, Freddy’s head in another hand, and being totally submerged in water, made that scene very difficult. Also, Ronny Yu wanted me to walk like I was walking on land. He wanted it to look like I could walk through the water without it making me rise to the surface. To do this effect, they had a rope tied under water that I held onto with my left hand (with Freddy’s severed head in it also), and I held myself down on the ground so I could pull myself and walk forward."&lt;ref name="fridaythe13thfilms1"/&gt;

'''Funny or Die''' is a comedy video website and film/television production company, founded by [[Will Ferrell]], [[Adam McKay]], [[Michael Kvamme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.studiosystem.com/c/funnyordie |title=Funny or Die - Studio System |publisher=Studio System |date= |accessdate=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Chris Henchy]]. The website Funny Or Die contains exclusive material from a regular staff of in-house writers, producers, and directors, and occasionally from a number of famous contributors including  [[Judd Apatow]], [[James Franco]], and [[Norm Macdonald]]. The production company makes TV shows including [[truTV]]'s ''[[Billy on the Street]]'', [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[@midnight]]'', and [[Zach Galifianakis]]'s [[Emmy]]-winning web series ''[[Between Two Ferns]]''.

Many videos on the site feature well-known actors (examples include [[Nina Dobrev]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Sophia Bush]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Adam West]], [[James Van Der Beek]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Ariel Winter]], and [[Selena Gomez]]). Michael Kvamme, an aspiring young comedian who is also the son of Mark Kvamme, the venture capitalist who funded Funny Or Die, came up with a concept for a new kind of comedy site; and the site was developed by Randy Adams.

Funny Or Die launched on April 12, 2007 with the site's first video, "[[The Landlord (2007 film)|The Landlord]]". "The Landlord" has received over 84 million views and features Ferrell confronted by a swearing, beer-drinking two-year-old landlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74 |title=The Landlord video page |publisher=Funny Or Die |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, they received venture capital funding from [[Sequoia Capital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequoiacap.com/company/funny-or-die/ |title=Sequoia Capital funds Funny Or Die}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2008, they announced a partnership with [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987248.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=HBO Joining Forces with FunnyorDie | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton | date=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 2016, Funny or Die shut down one of its California offices, reducing its headcount by 30% to 95 employees, with the announcement coming just two months after the new CEO, Mike Farah, took office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/funny-die-lays-dozens-staffers-916568|title=Funny or Die Lays Off Dozens of Staffers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online presence==
Unlike other viral video sites, members of Funny Or Die are encouraged to vote on videos which they view, with the options of "Funny" or "Die". The video then gets a score of the total percentage of people who voted the video "Funny". If the video receives an 80% or greater "Funny" rating after 100,000 views, it gets an "Immortal" ranking. If the video receives a 20% or less "Funny" rating after 1,000 views, it is relegated to the Crypt section of the site.

The Funny Or Die staff can also select a rating of "Chosen One", which disables voting for a video, merely saying "Chosen One" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/45e80741e8/chosen-ones|title=Chosen Ones|publisher=Funny or Die | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405074324/http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/45e80741e8/chosen-ones |archive-date=April 5, 2011 | access-date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their general drunkenness the narrators are unable to accurately discuss the historical events and oftentimes make up and embellish aspects of the story. Guests include [[Jack Black]], [[Michael Cera]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Chris Parnell]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Luke Wilson]], and [[Jason Schwartzman]].

====''@midnight''====

Gypsy Rose Lee was born in [[Seattle]], Washington, on January 8, 1911;&lt;ref name="Abbott1"&gt;Karen Abbott (2010) ''American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare, The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee'', New York: Random House; {{ISBN|1-4000-6691-3}}; {{OCLC|608296594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/the-untalented-gypsy-rose-lee/430/ Birthdate given as January 8], legacy.com; accessed September 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbott2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=Karen|title=American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare: The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjUYn60itMYC&amp;pg=PA405|date=March 2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7851-3|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Abbott (2012) presents a photocopy of an apparently non-certified certificate of live birth with some handwritten parts, from the King County Health Department, Record# 193, File # 1388, indicates January 8, 1911, although Lee always gave January 9 as her date of birth.}} however, she always gave January 9 as her date of birth.&lt;ref name="Abbott1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbott2"/&gt; She was known as Louise to her family. Her sister, actress [[June Havoc]], was born in 1912. Their mother, [[Rose Thompson Hovick]], forged various birth certificates for each of her daughters—older when needed to evade varying state child labor laws, and younger for reduced or free train fares. The girls were unsure until later in life what their years of birth were.&lt;ref name="Abbott1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;

Their mother had married [[Norwegian-American]] John Olaf Hovick, a newspaper-advertising salesman and a reporter at ''[[The Seattle Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"This is a story of three women whose dreams clashed" (July 16, 1980), ''Boston Globe'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noralee Frankel (2009) ''Stripping Gypsy: The Life of Gypsy Rose Lee'', Oxford University Press US; {{ISBN|0-19-536803-7}}; {{ISBN|978-0-19-536803-1}}&lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Lee Preminger (2004) ''My G-string mother: and home and backstage with Gypsy Rose Lee'', Frog Books; {{ISBN|1-58394-096-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58394-096-9}}, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; They married on May 28, 1910, in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;King County Department of Executive Services, Records and Licensing Division, Marriage Returns, 1891-1947, Marriage Certificates, 1855-1990, Office of the Secretary of State, Washington State Archives, [http://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/ Digital Archives], Source: King County Auditor, Marriage Certificates, 1855-1969; Marriage Returns, 1891-1947.

J. D. A. Powers officiating.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. Washington, Marriage Records, 1865-2004 from Washington State Archives. Olympia, Washington: Washington State Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hovick and Brennerman divorced, June supported the family by appearing in [[vaudeville]], being billed "Tiniest Toe Dancer in the World" when she was only 2½.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt; Rose and June went to Hollywood for two years where June appeared in short films directed by [[Hal Roach]].&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt; Louise was left behind while June and her mother were on the road. She had an elementary education, unlike June who was taught to read by stage-hands.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt; Much to her mother's displeasure, June eloped with Bobby Reed, a dancer in their act, in December 1928, and went on to pursue a brief career in [[marathon dancing]], a more profitable vocation than [[tap dancing]].&lt;ref name=vanity&gt;[[Laura Jacobs]] (March 2003) "Taking it all off", ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Vol. 511, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Louise's singing and dancing talents were insufficient to sustain the act without June. Eventually, it became apparent that Louise could make money in [[American burlesque|burlesque]], which earned her legendary status as an elegant and witty striptease artist. Initially, her act was propelled forward when a shoulder strap on one of her gowns gave way, causing her dress to fall to her feet despite her efforts to cover herself; encouraged by the audience's response, she went on to make the trick the focus of her performance.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Welshimer (February 14, 1937) "Burlesque's strippers graduate to Broadway", ''Laredo Times'' (Texas),  p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--have found at least 4 more refs for this story—will add--&gt;

Her innovations were an almost casual stripping style compared to the herky-jerky styles of most burlesque strippers (she emphasized the "tease" in "striptease"), and she brought a sharp sense of humor into her act as well. She became as famous for her onstage wit as for her stripping style, and—changing her stage name to Gypsy Rose Lee—she became one of the biggest stars of [[Minsky's Burlesque]], where she performed for four years. She was frequently arrested in raids on the Minsky brothers' shows. During the Great Depression, Lee spoke at various union meetings in support of New York laborers. According to activist Harry Fisher, her talks were among those that attracted the largest audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Harry (1998) ''Comrades: Tales of a Brigadista in the Spanish Civil War'', p. 10, University of Nebraska Press: Lincoln {{ISBN|978-0-80322-006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 and 1938, billed as Louise Hovick, she made five films in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0497346/ "Gypsy Rose Lee"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; But her acting was generally panned, so she returned to [[New York City]] where she had an affair with film producer [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]] and co-produced and appeared in his 1942 musical revue, ''[[Star and Garter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=5686 Profile], historylink.org; accessed August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee viewed herself as a "high-class" stripper, and she approved of [[H. L. Mencken]]'s term ''"[[ecdysiast]]"'', which he coined as a more "dignified" way of referring to the profession. Her style of intellectual recitation while stripping was spoofed in the number "Zip!" in [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart|Hart]]'s ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', a musical in which Havoc had appeared on Broadway, opposite [[Gene Kelly]]. Lee performed an abbreviated version of her act (intellectual recitation and all) in the 1943 film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]''. Her routine starts at about 1 hour 29 minutes into the film and lasts about six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Stage-Door-Canteen-Judith-Anderson/dp/B002CLZSS4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414944893&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stage+door+canteen ''Stage Door Canteen'' available on Amazon.com]; accessed August 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Lee authored a mystery thriller called ''[[The G-String Murders]]'', which was made into the sanitized 1943 film, ''[[Lady of Burlesque]]'' starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. While some assert this was in fact ghost-written by [[Craig Rice (author)|Craig Rice]], there are those who claim that there is more than sufficient written evidence in the form of manuscripts and Lee's own correspondence to prove that she wrote a large part of the novel herself under the guidance of Rice and others, including her editor [[George Davis (editor)|George Davis]], a friend and mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Tippins, Sherill.

New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1984, p. 243 {{ISBN|0824092198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's second murder mystery, ''Mother Finds a Body'', was published in 1942. In December 1942, preliminary papers alleging breach of contract were filed in the Supreme Court against Lee by Dorothy Wheelock, associate editor of Harper's Bazaar&lt;ref&gt; Nevada State Journal, 24 December 1942&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that in August 1940 she and Gypsy entered into what Wheelock described as "an oral agreement to collaborate on a joint venture involving the conception, construction, development, writing and exploitation of a literary work with a burlesque background. The agreement, Miss Wheelock went on, called for a 50:50 split on all income from sale of the book. She charged that she had lined up a publisher for the book when, in November 1940, Gypsy called off the collaboration ... Lee said she turned over notes and other material to Miss Wheelock and that the latter had then written 'a sample book'. However this sample book is not the book that was published, Gypsy declared. She denied any resemblance between Miss Wheelock's book and the book published under her own name, except such similarities as might stem from the notes Gypsy turned over to Miss Wheelock. Simon &amp; Schuster agreed to publish the book, Gypsy said, after the first three chapters were shown to them by [[Janet Flanner]], a New York writer".&lt;ref&gt;(New York) Daily News, 24 December 1942&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled out of court.

==Relationships==
[[Image:Gypsy Rose Lee NYWTS 1.jpg|thumb|right|Gypsy Rose Lee, full-length portrait]]
In Hollywood, she married Arnold "Bob" Mizzy on August 25, 1937, at the insistence of the film studio. She obtained a divorce in 1941, claiming cruelty, although biographer Noralee Frankel suggests the couple agreed that Lee could bring false charges so the divorce could go through uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frankel|first1=Noralee|title=Stripping Gypsy: The Life of Gypsy Rose Lee|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199709785|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UpRDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, she married [[Alexander Kirkland|William Alexander Kirkland]]; they divorced in 1944. While married to Kirkland, she gave birth on December 11, 1944, to a son fathered by [[Otto Preminger]]. Her son was named Erik Lee, but has since been known successively as Erik Kirkland, Erik de Diego, and [[Erik Lee Preminger]]. Gypsy married a third time in 1948, to [[Julio de Diego]], but that union also ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Noralee Frankel (2009) ''Stripping Gypsy: The Life of Gypsy Rose Lee'', New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 62, 68, 121–2, 147, 154–66, 195–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, she purchased a townhouse on East 63rd St in [[Manhattan]] with a private courtyard, 26 rooms and seven baths.&lt;ref&gt;Zemeckis, Leslie (2013). ''Behind The Burly Q Check'', Delaware, US: Skyhorse Publishing; {{ISBN|978-1-62087-691-6}}&lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Rose continued to demand money from Lee and Havoc. Lee rented a 10-room apartment on West End Avenue in Manhattan for Rose, who opened a boardinghouse for women there. On one occasion in the 1930s, Rose shot and killed a woman who was either a guest at the boardinghouse or a guest on the farm in [[Highland Mills]] in [[Orange County, New York]], that Rose owned. An historical website for lesbians cites varying reports of which place was the scene of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lostwomynsspace.blogspot.com/2015/07/roses-lesbian-boarding-house.html|title=Lost Womyn's Space: Rose's Lesbian Boarding House|first=|last=Anonymous|date=July 9, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gypsy's son Erik Lee Preminger, who is the author of several books, the murder victim was Mother Rose's female lover, who had allegedly made a pass at Gypsy. The violent incident was investigated and reportedly explained away as a suicide. Mother Rose was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Laura|last=Jacobs|title=Taking It All Off|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mother Rose's biographer strongly refutes the notion that this woman, Genevieve Augustine, was Rose's lover, and doubts Rose's complicity in her death in light of Augustine's previous suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mama Rose's Turn: The True Story of America's Most Notorious Stage Mother|author=Quinn, C.|date=2013|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781617038532|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRacAQAAQBAJ}}, pp. 152–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Thompson Hovick died in 1954 of [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].

==Later years==
[[Image:Gypsy Rose Lee NYWTS 2.jpg|thumb|Gypsy Rose Lee in 1956]]
After the death of their mother, the sisters now felt free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. ''[[Gypsy: A Memoir]]'' was  published in 1957 and served as inspiration for the [[Jule Styne]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], and [[Arthur Laurents]] 1959 musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''. Havoc did not like the way she was portrayed in the piece, but she was eventually persuaded (and paid) not to oppose it for her sister's sake.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The show and the [[Gypsy (1962 film)|1962 movie adaptation]] assured Gypsy a steady income. The sisters became estranged for a period of time but reconciled. June, in turn, wrote ''Early Havoc'' and ''More Havoc'', to relate her version of the story. Gypsy Rose Lee went on to host a morning San Francisco [[KGO-TV]] television talk show, ''Gypsy''. The walls of her Los Angeles home were adorned with pictures by [[Joan Miró]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Dorothea Tanning]], all reportedly given to her by the artists themselves.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Like many other Americans, and well-known artists such as Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway, Gypsy Rose Lee was a supporter of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] movement in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and raised money for charity to alleviate the suffering of Spanish children during the conflict. "She became politically active, and supported Spanish Loyalists during Spain's Civil War. She also became a fixture at Communist United Front meetings, and was investigated by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on un-American activities]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/45655-the-monday-interview-with-karen-abbott.html|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|title=The Monday Interview with Karen Abbott|date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who supported the campaign of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]]&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Legacy==
*The song "Zip" from the musical "Pal Joey" (written by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]) imagines the thoughts and musings that go through Gypsy Rose Lee's mind while she strips onstage as recounted by way of an interviewer who sings of their encounter with Miss Lee as being "the greatest achievement" they'd had. [[Elaine Stritch]] regularly performed this song (as the interviewer) for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Rodgers &amp; Hart's 'Zip'|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/a-guide-to-rodgers-harts-zip-com-101086|website=Playbill|accessdate=March 30, 2018|language=en|date=January 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JAMfest Super Nationals''' is one of the biggest competitions that [[JAMfest Cheer and Dance]] offers.  This competition has been held in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana since 1999 inside the [[Indiana Convention Center]], where this event has been and will be held until 2020.  This event is planned around the second or third weekend in January and is a two-day competition.  The first day of competing is worth 25% of your total score and the second and final day is worth the other 75% of your score. For the last 5 years there have been over 400 cheerleading teams that have attended and competed and those teams have come from over twenty states and two countries.  This event is one of the biggest steps for All Star [[Cheerleaders]] and can hopefully land them a bid to The Cheerleading Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://usasf.net&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheerleading Worlds is the "final destination" in an All Star Cheerleaders life.  It is where they show everything they have in two minute and thirty seconds in hopes of becoming World Champions. The day before JAMfest Super Nationals actually starts, another competition is held for certain elite teams from all over. This smaller competition is only a one day event, and your team must be invited to compete. This one day event is known as the Majors and the teams that compete in it, are classified as [http://www.experiencethemajors.com "the best of the best".] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.experiencethemajors.com|title=The MAJORS Cheer Competition for the Most Elite Athletes and Programs|website=www.experiencethemajors.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Cheerleading Worlds==
The Cheerleading Worlds is the highest success for any all star level 5 team. The [[Cheerleading Worlds]] competition is held in Orlando, Florida every year. School teams and "All-Star" teams once competed against each other when this competition was first founded. The [[National Cheerleaders Association]] decided that these teams needed to be separated. So they created different divisions for each level of team and their difficulty. Teams attend competitions like JAMfest Super Nationals to obtain a bid to this competition.  Cheerleaders are only able to compete at worlds if their team receives a bid or an "invite." The Cheerleading Worlds is held every year in Orlando, Florida at ESPNs Wide World of Sports. On top of trophies, banners, and medals that can be won, they also win a World Champion ring. 

==Jammy==
Jammy is not only the mascot for JAMfest Cheer and Dance &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamfest.com/AboutJAMfest.php&lt;/ref&gt; but he is also their spirit icon.  Jammy attends every JAMfest event and is constantly on the look out for the next spirit award winner.  Having good spirit is a great and positive way to get any team noticed and Jammy makes sure those teams get the recognition they deserve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64107">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''EastEnders'' two-hander episodes}}
'''''EastEnders'' two-hander episodes''' refers to singular episodes of the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' that feature only two members of the cast for the duration. Scripted like mini-plays, [[two-hander]] episodes have become a tradition in ''EastEnders'' over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans [[Den Watts]] and [[Angie Watts]].&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi-weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Typically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Practically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode.

== Two-hander episodes ==

===Den and Angie (16 October 1986)===
The first two-hander featured [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]). The episode was structured like a [[tennis]] match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode was written by Jane Hollowood and directed by [[Antonia Bird]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861016.shtml Angie - six months to live]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to give Den and Angie a two-hander due to the popularity of the couple.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07chwf7 From EastEnders to Hollywood: Antonia Bird]'', [[BBC Four]], 26 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Den and Angie's marriage had been hanging by a thread all year, and in October 1986 Den finally decided that it was over and attempted to leave Angie for his mistress, [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). The episode began with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wanted to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalled but Den persisted and stated his case. Den told her that he wanted a clean break from her, the pub, [[Albert Square]] and [[Walford]]. He told her he'd be getting another pub through a deal with [[James Wilmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but Angie kept to her story and, finally, her hysterical performance convinced him. Den crumbled and promised to stay with her saying "If I ever find out you're kidding me, Ange, I'll kill ya..."  and then, consumed by guilt, he asked her for forgiveness. As he left to take [[Roly]] for a walk and be alone, Angie broke into a deranged smile, letting the audience in on her secret that she had been lying.

===Dot and Ethel (2 July 1987)===

The second two-hander featured the old friends [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), who were baby-sitting [[Vicki Fowler]] (Emma Henry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centred around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

While baby Vicki napped, Dot and Ethel reminisced about their lives during World War II]and shared secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family,  who were killed by a German [[V-1 flying bomb|doodlebug]]. Dot was [[Emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to [[Wales]] when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called Auntie Gwen and Uncle Will, who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious [[Harold Legg|Dr Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) to punch Charlie on the nose in [[The Queen Vic]]. Towards the end of the episode Dot went out to the shop for a [oaf]of bread and some fig rolls. When she returned Ethel was asleep and Dot thought she had died and began weeping and reciting the Lord's Prayer. When Ethel roused, Dot panicked and Ethel had to slap her out of it.

===Sharon and Michelle (4 April 1989)===
The third two-hander featured the best friends [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). In the aftermath of Sharon's father's death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

After [[Den Watts]]'s ([[Leslie Grantham]]) supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Samantha Leigh Martin]]) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over 3 years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her.

===Grant and Phil (15 November 1994)===
{{see also|Sharongate}}
This episode featured the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again.

As Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon wasn't a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear.

They then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her "like a table tennis ball" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in [[prison]]. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them.

===Pat and Peggy (27 October 1998)===
This episode featured [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fiancé [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and his ex-wife Pat. However Pat had other concerns. Her husband, [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear.

Pat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too.

After opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and [[impotent]], whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down.

After the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy "mutton dressed as lamb" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying "YOU BITCH!" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming "YOU COW!", right before the doorbell rang.

===Roy and Frank (29 October 1998)===

Occurring simultaneously to the [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) two-hander described above, this episode featured [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision.

Frank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually Roy turned into a [[multi-storey car park]], drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating [[suicide]]. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late.

Roy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded "Just".

===Matthew and Steve (3 February 2000)=== &lt;!-- Linked from Tom Hooper (director) --&gt;
This episode featured [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) and [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]). Steve had let Matthew serve time in prison for [[Saskia Duncan]]'s (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) murder. Upon his release Matthew came to Walford looking for revenge. 19.8 million viewers watched this episode.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20000203.shtml "Matthew's revenge"]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister [[Jackie Owen]] ([[Race Davies]]) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded £10,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the [[bullet]]s. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair.

When Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, [[Claudia Fielding|Claudia]] (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered [[petrol]] around the room and then pulled a [[Zippo|zippo lighter]] from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy.

===Ricky and Phil (20 April 2000)===
This episode featured [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and his long-time employer [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). After losing his wife, son, and finally his mind Ricky said an emotional farewell to the Square, and Phil tried to talk him out of leaving.

Ricky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing {{convert|90|mph}} when he crashed.

Ricky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station.

Phil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby had [[spina bifida]]. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him.

As dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for him. Phil apologised for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him, and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed.

===Kat and Zoe (2 October 2001)===
This episode featured [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her daughter [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), who up until this moment had lived her whole life thinking that Kat was her sister. Zoe announced that she was leaving Walford to go and live with her uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]) in [[Spain]], but Kat was adamant that she was not. A screaming row ensued and when Zoe shouted "You ain't my mother", Kat's desperate reply was, "Yes I am!". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20011001.shtml "You're not my mother..."]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury.

The news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle.

===Sonia and Dot (9 May 2002)===
This episode featured [[Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and her step-grandmother [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own.

With [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Rebecca Miller]] asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, [[Neil Miller (EastEnders)|Neil Miller]] (Robin Sneller) and [[Sue Miller (EastEnders)|Sue Miller]] ([[Victoria Willing]]), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police.

Sonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued.

Sonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of [[Mark Fowler]]'s ([[Todd Carty]]) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers.

Just as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents.

===Phil and Sharon (5 September 2002)===
This episode featured the ex-lovers [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives.

Sharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with [[Tom Banks (EastEnders)|Tom Banks]] ([[Colm Ó Maonlaí]]), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie, and Phil had given [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of [[The Queen Vic]]. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead.

Sharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) could do no wrong. After one horrific [[Christmas]], Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections.

Sharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too.

===Little Mo and Trevor (31 October 2002)===
This episode featured [[Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her abusive husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). It was the night of Little Mo and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at ''Angie's Den'' and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage.

Trevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including "till death us do part". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother. He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it.

Trevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her.

Little Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived.

===Lisa and Phil (27 March 2003)===
This episode featured [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) and her ex-boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to [[Portugal]], Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter.

After fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping her daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge.

Lisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise.

Phil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog let alone a baby! He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Lou was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for her baby.

Exhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did.

Lisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff.

===Den and Sharon (30 September 2003)===
This episode reunited [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) with his adopted daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), after she'd spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her dad emerged from the shadows and muttered "Hello, Princess!". Sharon couldn't believe that her dad was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger.

Sharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]) - a gangster associated with his attempted murder - had died. He apologised to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon.

As the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife, [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a "barmy old lush". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered though the Square, before breaking into The Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon couldn't remember many good times – she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave.

Sharon decided that she wasn't going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but she insisted that she, [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) didn't need him. Den assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and told her he wasn't important. Then Sharon revealed that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son.

===Den and Dennis (1 April 2004)===
This episode featured [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]). Father and son went head to head in The Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser.

Den had just discovered that his adopted daughter, [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), was sleeping with his son. He was not happy. In The Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him "son", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off.

Den continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a dad, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home.

===Kat and Alfie (25 May 2004)===
This episode featured [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]). Alfie had been given a video of [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) sleeping with his wife. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses.

The episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing.

As it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie  revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door.

As Kat left The Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it. They agreed that it would be tough, but decided to try to find a way to work things out.

===Den and Dot (26 August 2004)===
This episode featured long-time neighbours, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Den's wife had left him following his affair, and his relationship with his son was in tatters after he propositioned his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dot was arguing with her husband, [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]) and was very reluctant to tell him about her secret cancer illness. Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others.

Late one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying.

Dot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blasé, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness.

Eventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had [[kidney cancer]]. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering.
Den wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out.

When Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving. At home Den apologised to his son and heeding Dot's advice, he bit the bullet and called Chrissie. Meanwhile, Dot took Den's advice and decided that it was time to come clean to Jim.

===Max and Stacey (26 March 2010)===
Following [[Stacey Branning]]'s ([[Lacey Turner]]) confession to her father-in-law [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that she murdered [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) (see [[Who Killed Archie?]], the two characters featured in a two-hander episode on 26 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a206924/max-comes-face-to-face-with-stacey.html|title=Max comes face-to-face with Stacey|last=Green|first=Kris|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer was kept a secret from all the cast until 30 minutes before a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast on 19 February 2010, meaning that the script for the two-hander episode, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], could not be released until after the broadcast, though later episodes had already been completed.&lt;ref name="Stax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a204893/eastenders-pens-max-stacey-two-hander.html|title='EastEnders' pens Max, Stacey two-hander|last=Green|first=Kris|date=23 February 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a210371/jake-wood-max-branning-eastenders.html|title=Jake Wood (Max Branning, 'EastEnders')|last=Green|first=Kris|date=25 March 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood described Ashdown's script as "amazing", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse. One 19-minute scene took up 26 pages in the script, and was filmed in two takes.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; The entire episode was filmed in three night shoots and one studio shoot. It was originally scheduled to be filmed over three days, but a fourth day was added for on-location filming.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; Some night-time location filming was done on 9 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1256868/EastEnders-Max-tells-Stacey-come-clean-Archie-killing.html|title=EastEnders spoiler alert: Max takes Stacey hostage as he tells her to come clean over killing Archie|last=Johnson|first=Chris|date=10 March 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode follows on from the previous episode where Max discovers where his daughter-in-law Stacey is staying after the death of her husband, [[Bradley Branning|Bradley]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), and her confession to the murder of Archie. Max goes up to her flat and enters, pressing her for details of Archie's murder, the night of Bradley's death and what she had done in her absence. Stacey reveals that after she fled the morgue, she contemplated suicide but could not bring herself to do it for the sake of her unborn child; she then went to her mother's old flat which was deserted and did not move for three days; eventually leaving to buy food and drink. Max tells her that he wants to hand her in to the police. Max then chases Stacey outside, where she trips and he catches her. He then drags Stacey to a car, which he breaks into and bundles her into. He then hot-wires the car and drives to a police station. After telling Stacey that she must confess to her mother and the [[Mitchell family|Mitchells]] first, he drives her back to [[Walford]] where he eventually changes his mind after expressing that Bradley would want her to be happy. The episode ends with them both entering their respective houses and the camera panning up over [[Walford]], rising so high that it morphs into the ''EastEnders'' credits.

===Sharon and Michelle (12 January 2017)===
This episode features [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) revealing to her best friend [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) her reasons for returning to the United Kingdom after 20 years. Although their scenes are interspersed with scenes of [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) at home waiting for her cat, and the episode credits 20 characters, it was officially considered a two-hander by [[BBC Store]] and was included in their "''EastEnders'': Two's Company" collection of two-hander episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.bbc.com/collections/eastenders-twos-company|title=EastEnders: Two's Company|publisher=[[BBC Store]]|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phil and Jay (21 August 2017) ===
During this episode, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) explains to [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) why he has given him the car lot, which is worth £300,000 rather than giving it to his son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), who received the lesser valued Arches. Phil tells Jay that [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) was not his biological father as he didn't know Jay's mother until two months after his birth. Phil tells Jay that a tramp living rough around Albert Square, named Alan Hall, was his birth father and that in an insurance scam back in 1994 he and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) committed arson to the car lot and that they weren't aware Alan was sleeping in one of the cars within. Phil attempts to persuade Jay that there would be no point in going to prison because he is still paying for the crime in the form of guilt. At the end of the episode Jay is seen sat at "Jase's bench" while Phil is seen making a phone call to an unknown person, he tells them that he's "done it" and "fed him [Jay] a pack of lies and that it's now their turn to keep to the deal".

==Three and four-hander episodes==
''EastEnders'' is also notable for featuring three and four-hander episodes. Within three-hander episodes three characters usually interact separately with each other in differing scenes, whilst four-handers often include two sets of characters stories which occur simultaneously, although they are not directly connected to each other there is usually a linking theme.

===Notable three-handers===
* [[Kathy Beale]], [[Pete Beale]] and [[James Willmott-Brown]] (13 February 1992) - Kathy finally laid to rest the ghost of her rape and convinced Pete that their marriage was truly over.
* [[Sharon Watts]], [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] and [[Phil Mitchell]] (3 September 1992) - After Phil had slept with his brother's wife, Sharon, the protagonists had to deal with the aftermath and the possibility that Grant would discover what had happened. Phil made it clear that he was willing to tell Grant, but when the moment came Sharon decided to choose Grant rather than Phil.
* [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]], [[Sonia Fowler]] and [[Sarah Cairns]] (22 October 2004) - Whilst Sarah, Martin's stalker, held his wife Sonia against her will at the Fowlers, Martin was facing a race against time in order to rescue his marriage. Sarah tried to poison Sonia against Martin. When this didn't work she turned violent and stabbed Martin with a pen knife, Sonia lashed out and hit Sarah with a fruit bowl.
* [[Alfie Moon]], [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] and [[Little Mo Mitchell]] (16 September 2005) - Alfie had been seeing both his wife, Kat, and her sister Little Mo at the same time. Alfie urged Kat to give their relationship another go. However, Kat realised that true love meant making sacrifices and she couldn't hurt her sister by being with him.
* [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]], [[Ronnie Mitchell]] and [[Bianca Jackson]] (18 August 2009) - Dot, Ronnie and Bianca are locked in [[The Queen Victoria]] and Ronnie and Bianca fight over their children. Dot reveals that she doesn't want to retire and Bianca and Ronnie bond over their past. The episode, written by Wendy Granditer, is the show's first all-female three-hander. Executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] described the episode as "exciting and unique", and said, "We realised that three of our most loved female characters had big turning points this week — Ronnie trying to make the right decision about her relationship with Joel, Dot facing a tough choice about Jim and Bianca finally allowing herself to recognise her true feelings for Ricky. We decided to give those characters [...] some space to thrash out their dilemmas in the form of a (nearly) three-handed episode. Usually when we do a two-hander, we're playing out a story for two characters who are very close, but in this case, unusually, we're featuring characters who don't usually relate to one another. But that is what makes this episode all the more exciting and unique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a171568/walford-exec-discusses-three-hander.html|title=Walford exec discusses three-hander|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 August 2009|accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ALICE/MICHAEL/JANINE AS THIS WAS NOT A THREE-HANDER. IF IT IS OFFICIALLY CONSIDERED A THREE-HANDER, PLEASE SUPPLY A RELIABLE SOURCE TO CONFIRM THIS --&gt;
* [[Mick Carter]], [[Linda Carter]] and [[Whitney Carter]] (8 August 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/19/eastenders-spoilers-boss-sean-oconnor-reveals-dramatic-mick-whitney-and-linda-three-hander-6648838/|title=EastEnders spoilers Dramatic Mick, Linda and Whitney three hander ahead|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=19 May 2017|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Mick reveals to his wife Linda that he has fallen in love with somebody else. Linda correctly guesses that he means their daughter-in-law, Whitney. She is disgusted with Mick, and pins Whitney up against the wall when confronting her.

Mick then interrogates Linda about why she stayed away from Walford for so long, leading to an almighty argument. After Mick leaves the pub, Whitney tells him that he should not have told Linda about the kiss and that he has lost everything.

===Notable four-handers===
* [[Michelle Fowler]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] - [[Cindy Beale]] and [[David Wicks]] (3 October 1995) - After Michelle mistakenly thought Grant had discovered that her brother was suffering with HIV, she went to confront him in The Vic and only rose his suspicions further. Realising her mistake Michelle was forced to admit she was in the wrong. Grant took great pleasure in this and proceeded to remind her of her intrusion into his marriage with Sharon. As the two continued to bicker about Grant's treatment of Sharon they began drinking and managed to find some common ground in their past behaviour. The drink took hold and they finished the night in bed. Meanwhile, Cindy and David had met up away from Walford to conduct their affair, but the night was ruined when a familiar face spotted them and Cindy feared that her husband may be informed about her misconduct.

As she began to suffer from heart pains, she requested a kiss from her son. Eventually she forced him to give her a long incestuous kiss on the lips, but this disgusted Steve. He called her a sick woman and left. Meanwhile, Barry pleaded with Natalie not to go through with her decision to abort their baby, but she had made up her mind.

Den tried one last time to get Chrissie to forgive him following his affair with [[Kate Mitchell]] but she refused and he packed his bags and took off in a taxi for the airport. (Due to Leslie Grantham's suspension from the show) Meanwhile, Dot finally told Jim that she had cancer.

==Single-hander episode==
{{Main|Pretty Baby....}}
''EastEnders'' had its first (and only to date) single-hander episode which featured only one character; [[Dot Cotton]] in the entire episode. The episode saw Dot recording a [[cassette tape]] of memories for her husband [[Jim Branning|Jim]] and was written by [[Tony Jordan]]. The episode was shown on 31 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a79956/enders-dot-for-soaps-first-single-hander.html Soaps - News - Enders' Dot for soap's first single-hander - Digital Spy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was watched by 8.7 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/01/tvratings.television?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media|title=Dot's monologue seen by 8.7 million|work=Guardian Unlimited|first=Chris|last=Tryhorn|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the usual [[EastEnders theme tune|theme music]], the credits had the song "[[Pretty Baby (song)|Pretty Baby]]" playing over them, as it was referenced in the episode.

In March 2009, actress [[June Brown]] was nominated for the Best TV Actress award at the [[British Academy Television Awards]] for her portrayal of Dot in this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7960662.stm|title=Bafta nod for EastEnders' Brown |publisher=BBC News|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences elsewhere==
''EastEnders'' two-handers have since been emulated in other British soap operas, notably ''[[Coronation Street]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a44010/tracy-reveals-all-to-deirdre.html|title=Coronation Street Spoilers: Tracy reveals all to Deirdre|work= [[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 March 2007|accessdate=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Brookside]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksidesoapbox.co.uk/facts_5.htm|title=Brookside Facts: Characters...

This page lists [[Las Vegas Valley]] [[lounge music]] performers.

==Origins of Las Vegas nightlife==
The pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene were [[The Mary Kaye Trio]] with [[Mary Kaye]]. Although the lounge existed in Las Vegas hotels, it was not until the trio started the "Dusk til Dawn"{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=a club?  an act?}} that the nightlife existed in Las Vegas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Many credit [[Louis Prima]] as the original, but the trio started it five years before Prima came to Vegas. Prima and [[Keely Smith]] followed the trio in the origins of Las Vegas nightlife.

==Description==
Founded in 2006 by [[Sebastien Nasra]] (Avalanche Productions) and British festival programmer [[Martin Elbourne]] ([[Glastonbury Festival]], [[The Great Escape Festival|The Great Escape]], and co-founder along with [[Peter Gabriel]] of [[WOMAD Festival]]), M for Montreal is an independent organization whose mission is to help emerging artists launch their career and/or export their music outside of [[Québec]] and [[Canada]]. It is divided in two parts: a conference including panels and workshops, and a festival, which showcases close to 100 bands annually. From music buyers to journalists, more than 200 international delegates attend M for Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mformontreal.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, M for Montreal became a marquee event in Montreal’s cultural scene as well as a catalyst for the local industry. Past notable acts include: [[Mac DeMarco]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]], [[Half Moon Run]], [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[Coeur de Pirate]], [[Blue Hawaii (band)|Blue Hawaii]], [[M83 (band)|M83]], [[The Stills]], [[Pierre Lapointe]], Foxtrott, [[A Tribe Called Red]], and many more.

==M on the Road==

Additionally, M programs events throughout the year in Montreal, partnering with organizations such as OUMF and [[Quartier des Spectacles]].

==Accolades==
''Rencontrer la bonne personne au bon moment, dit l'adage. À M pour Montréal, il y a beaucoup de «bonnes personnes» à rencontrer.'' – Émilie Côté,  [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/musique/201310/16/01-4700105-m-pour-montreal-un-evenement-a-cinq-tetes.php&lt;/ref&gt;

''The festival, although small and packed over a few short days, seemed to offer a genuine taste of what the music scene in Montreal is like. ''  – [[Noisey]] (Vice) &lt;ref&gt;http://noisey.vice.com/blog/m-for-montreal-weekend-highlights&lt;/ref&gt;

''(...) it's a quirky, off-kilter little festival that's grown quite a bit in recent years.'' – [[Noisey]] (Vice) &lt;ref&gt;http://noisey.vice.com/blog/m-for-montreal-day-one-highlights&lt;/ref&gt;

''The beauty of M for Montreal isn’t that they try to reinvent the festival, but that they streamline it and find efficiencies wherever possible. In its ninth year, the festival excels at presenting music fans with an endless stream of concerts that have all been programmed to be as accessible as possible. ''  –  [[Noisey]] (Vice) &lt;ref&gt;http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/m-for-montreal-day-one-highlights&lt;/ref&gt;

''A sprawling fusion of language, culture, style and taste, Montreal is – culturally and politically – one of Canada’s most important cities. / Held in venues across the historic port, M For Montreal is every bit as varied as the city itself. Clash is busy exploring a labyrinthine complex of venues, turning up a few surprises in the process. ''  – Robyn Murray, CLASH &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clashmusic.com/news/m-for-montreal-13-tips&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plus qu’un festival de musique traditionnel, M pour Montréal est une créature hybride qui étend ses tentacules dans divers quartiers de la ville pour dévoiler un best of de la scène musicale canadienne, en anglais et en français. '' – Marie-Hélène Mello, [[RFI Musique]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfimusique.com/actu-musique/chanson/20131125-montreal-festival-rock-rap-electro&lt;/ref&gt;

''What the festival showed more than anything was a country’s music scene in rude health (...). There’s a lot going on here, spanning genres often not associated with the city. '' – Luke Holland, [[The Guardian]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/28/m-for-montreal-music-festival-roundup&lt;/ref&gt;

''La deuxième ville du Canada domine la scène musicale mondiale grâce à une activité et une diversité déconcertante. L’effet de mode est passé, l’incroyable vitalité culturelle de la ville perdure. Années après années, tendances après tendances, Montréal continue à distribuer des dizaines d’excitations, incarnées par autant de nouveaux groupes qu’il y a de salles sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent. '' – Azzedine Fall, [[Les Inrocks]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lesinrocks.com/2014/11/27/musique/la-scene-montrealaise-a-evolue-depuis-lexplosion-darcade-fire-11537284/&lt;/ref&gt;

''C’est dans ce contexte ultraconcurrentiel que M pour Montréal, pourtant arrivé après bien d’autres, est parvenu à se tailler une réputation des plus flatteuses, au beau milieu d’autres concentrations musicales majeures. '' – Gilles Renault, [[Libération]] &lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/musique/2014/12/01/montreal-corps-et-m_1154517&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martha Ellen Davis''' is an [[emeritus professor]] from the [[University of Florida]], [[anthropologist]] and [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] known for her multifarious work on [[African Diaspora|African diasporic]] religion and music. Professor Davis' research has defied conventional tenets about [[Music of Haiti|
Haitian]] and [[Music of the Dominican Republic|Dominican folk music]], and her cultural preservation projects has raised awareness of the significance of the [[Samaná Americans|Samaná Americanos' enclave]].

==Education and early work==
Davis received her B.A. (Magna Cum Laude) in [[Anthropology]] from the [[University of California]] and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Illinois]]. Her graduate field work took her to various Caribbean islands, of which she has published,&lt;ref name="Back Matter"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q6VhhkczIYS1o2UkR6T3dKS2s | title=Back Matter | author=The Editors | journal=Ethnomusicology| date=January 1972 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was in the [[Dominican Republic]] where early on in her graduate career she established her reputation as an [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]], [[Cultural critic|critic]] and dedicated scholar to [[Afro-Caribbean|Black culture]]. In 1972, she arrived at the island of [[Hispaniola]] with the suspicion that [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] owned more to the [[Afro-Caribbean]] culture than what had been documented yet.  In an article published in a leading [[Listín Diario|Dominican newspaper]], Xiomarita Perez wrote candidly about Davis' style and links to the country: "Martha works from the heart and with the heart... Her job is essential to the country's social memory" ([[Spanish Language|Spanish]]:«Martha trabaja de corazón y con el corazón... Su oficio es delicado e importante para la memoria social del país»).&lt;ref name="Folcloreadno"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.listindiario.com/la-vida/2012/10/31/253129/martha-ellen-davis | title=Folcloreadno: Martha Ellen Davis |publisher= Listín Diario| date=October 31, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2015 | author=Pérez, Xiomarita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional involvement==

Part of Davis' legacy includes co-founding the Committee of Applied Ethnomusicology within the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eo1yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Committee+of+%22Applied+Ethnomusicology%22+Martha+Ellen+Davis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LO4s-JQju3&amp;sig=Qizrc83UciqZWQCLNRwTZFpJ_GM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2nbGW1_TJAhWJJx4KHX9UAO4Q6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Committee%20of%20%22Applied%20Ethnomusicology%22%20Martha%20Ellen%20Davis&amp;f=false | title=The Oxford Handbook of Applied Ethnomusicology | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Todd Titon, Jeff | year=2015 | location=Oxford | pages=27 | isbn=0199351708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Groups_SectionsAE | title=Applied Ethnomusicology Section | publisher=Society of Ethnomusicology | accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.brown.edu/cds/invested_in_community/bios.html | title=Invested in Community: Ethnomusicology and Musical Advocacy | publisher=Brown University Library Center for Digital Scholarship | accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing four seminal books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668246| title=La otra ciencia: el vodú dominicano como religión y medicina populares | publisher=Editora Universitaria (UASD) | author=Davis, Martha | year=1987 | location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=20174439 | title=Film and Video Reviews | journal=Ethnomusicology | year=2006 | volume=50 | issue=1 | pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing numerous scientific articles. She has been considered an authority in [[Afro-Caribbean music]] and is quoted extensively in the literature. Davis' book, ''La otra ciencia'', earned the National Nonfiction Award of the Dominican Republic. While continuing as an affiliate professor at the University of Florida, since ca. 2003 Davis has spent most of her time in the Dominican Republic as honorary researcher of the Museo del Hombre Dominicano (Museum of the Dominican Man) and oral-history expert and researcher of the Archivo General de la Nación (The National Archives), offering lectures, advising young scholars, and writing. In November 1, 2012, the Museo celebrated her 40 years of research in the country.&lt;ref name="Celebración"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rossydiaz.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/celebracion-a-etnomusicologa-martha-ellen-davis/ | title=Celebración a etnomusicóloga Martha Ellen Davis | publisher=Museo del Hombre Dominicano | work=Blog | date=October 15, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2015 | author=Díaz, Rossy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Davis' long-standing interest in the Dominican and Haitian cultures derives from her belief that "The island of Hispaniola—the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo and first colony in the New World—was the initial diasporal crucible and cultural bridge of [[the Americas]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q6VhhkczIYUzEzS0xickl4TEE | title=Diasporal Dimensions of Dominican Folk Religion and Music | author=Davis, Martha Ellen | journal=Black Music Research Journal | year=2012 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=161–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Davis, who rivals [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in years of research into Afro-Caribbean culture, challenged the Dominican cultural establishment.  According to Peter Manuel from [[CUNY]], she convincingly suggested "that if there is any rightful ‘national’ music of the Dominican Republic, it would be not the [[Merengue music|Merengue]], with its specifically regional origin in the [[Cibao]], but rather the various types of ''salve'', which have flourished throughout the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=El Merengue: Musica y Baile de la Republica Dominicana, and: El Merengue en la Cultura Dominicana y del Caribe: Memorias del Primer Congreso Internacional "Musica, Identidad, y Cultura en el Caribe" | author=Manuel, Peter | journal=Latin American Music Review | year=2007 | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=172 | doi=10.1353/lat.2007.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41348253 | title=El origen de sones afroantillanos: perspectivas dominicanas con respecto a "Son de la Ma' Teodora" | author=Bars, Karoline | journal=Latin American Music Review | year=2011 | volume=32 | issue=2 | pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has also crossed into the realm of religion, and here she also suggested that what is commonly called Dominican "Folk Religion" is more accurately described as folk Catholicism of which one component is "Dominican [[Dominican Vudú|Vodou]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sites and politics of religious diversity in southern Europe: the best of all gods | publisher=Brill | author=Mapril, Jose | year=2013 | pages=39 | isbn=90-04-25523-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mockbuster''' (also known as '''knockbuster''' or a '''drafting opportunity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |first=Ben
 |last=Fritz}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[movie]] created with the intention of exploiting the publicity of another major motion picture with a similar title or subject. Mockbusters are often made with a low budget and quick production to maximize profit. Unlike films that are produced to capitalize on the popularity of a recent release by adopting similar genre or storytelling elements, mockbusters are generally produced concurrently with upcoming films, and released [[direct-to-video]] at the same time the real film reaches theaters or video outlets. A mockbuster may be similar enough in title, packaging, etc. in hopes that consumers confuse it with the actual film it mimics, but their producers maintain that they are simply offering additional products for consumers who want to watch additional films in the same subgenres.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{cite news

"Mockbuster" is a [[portmanteau]] combining the words "mock" with "blockbuster."

==History==
Mockbusters have a long history in Hollywood and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=Editorial Writer(s) |title=''Faux Film Festival''|url=http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/01/21/|publisher=''[[Suck.com]]''|date=January 21, 2000 |accessdate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rico|last=Gagliano|title=''Bollywood's copycat film industry''|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/03/17/bollywood_copycats/|publisher=''Marketplace''|date=March 17, 2008|accessdate=May 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194109/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/03/17/bollywood_copycats|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank|last= Lovece|title=''Faux Lee Artists''|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306450,00.html|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=May 7, 1993 |accessdate=May 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean |last=Baby |title=''Turkish Star Wars, E.T., Wizard of Oz'' |url=http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=22122 |publisher=''[[Wave Magazine]]'' |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112194912/http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=22122 |archivedate=November 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1959 Vanwick film ''[[The Monster of Piedras Blancas]]'' was a clear derivative of ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'', complete with a creature suit by the same designer, Jack Kevan. ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'' spawned ''[[Village of the Giants]]''; ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' spawned ''[[Legend of Dinosaurs &amp; Monster Birds]]''.

Such films tend to fit the classic [[B movie]] model, produced on a small budget and derivative of the target film and other similar projects. The reduced costs made available by using modern video and computer graphics equipment, and the tie-in to the mainstream film's advertising, has allowed the mockbuster to find a profitable niche in the home video market. [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]], at one time one of the largest DVD and video game rental chains, gave implied support to the concept by buying 100,000 copies of [[The Asylum]]'s version of ''[[H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (David Michael Latt film)|War of the Worlds]]'' in time to coincide with the theatrical opening week of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|film based on the same novel]] starring [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

Most mockbusters capitalize on the popularity of theatrically released movies, but some are derivative of a TV series or other popular form of media. The 1979 film ''[[Angels Revenge]]'' bore many superficial similarities to the popular TV series ''[[Charlie's Angels]];'' its promotional materials even resembled ''Charlie's Angels''' graphic style.

[[GoodTimes Entertainment]] was notorious for distributing animated "mockbuster" counterparts to popular Disney films in the 1990s (such as those made by [[Golden Films]]); because Disney was creating its films based on public domain folk tales and historical stories, GoodTimes' actions were completely legal and survived Disney's legal challenge against it. Similarly, [[Vídeo Brinquedo]] is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Computer animation|CGI animation]] studio that in 2006 began to produce low-budget direct-to-video films that are for the most part knockoffs of movies from [[Pixar]], [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]], and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]. Their titles and the films they are considered to be derivative of include ''Little &amp; Big Monsters'' (DreamWorks' ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''), ''The Little Cars'' series of cartoons (Pixar's ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' series), ''Ratatoing'' (Pixar's ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''), ''Tiny Robots'' (Pixar's ''[[WALL-E]]''), ''What's Up?: Balloon to the Rescue!'' (Pixar's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''), and ''The Frog Prince'' (Disney's ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''). In every case Vídeo Brinquedo's knockoffs has been released suspiciously close to the release date of the more professional, higher-budgeted film that inspired it.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

{{Anchor|Dingo_pictures}}Dingo Pictures, a [[Germany|German]] animation company based in [[Friedrichsdorf]], also created traditionally-animated cartoons based on fairy tales and concepts similar to those used by Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks. These cartoons are characterized by low-budget animation, small voice casts, and character designs that are very similar to equivalent characters in more high-profile movies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The cartoons have also been dubbed into Scandinavian languages notably Swedish, and also into Romance languages, notably Italian, and all of them have been released [[direct-to-video]] in Germany in their original languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} A company called Phoenix Games collaborated with Dingo Pictures in the early 2000s to produce interactive video game versions of some of their films for the [[PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]]. These games included the film as well as a small collection of mini games. Phoenix Games went out of business in 2009.

The 2011 film ''[[Aliens vs Avatars]]'' was named to market it as a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] to ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]],'' even though it has no connection with the two films.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The film follows the intergalactic battle between a quarrelsome alien race and shape-shifting extraterrestrials, while six college friends find themselves in the middle of the interstellar war.

A 1993 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] titled ''[[Carnosaur (film)|Carnosaur]],'' produced by [[Roger Corman]] and starring [[Diane Ladd]] as a [[mad scientist]] who plans to recreate dinosaurs and destroy humanity, is loosely based on the 1984 novel [[Carnosaur (novel)|of the same name]] by [[John Brosnan]], but the two have little in common. It was released by New Horizon Picture Corp two weeks before the blockbuster ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]].'' ''Carnosaur'' may be considered a mockbuster.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Raftery. "[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_the_asylum/all/1 Now Playing: Cheap-and-Schlocky Blockbuster Ripoffs]", ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', 21 December 2009. Retrieved 25 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Ladd's daughter [[Laura Dern]] starred in ''Jurassic Park''.

In some cases, the knockoff film may bear little or no resemblance to the original. In 2012, ''[[Super K – The Movie]]'', an Indian fantasy/science-fiction animated film about an artificially created boy named "Super Kloud" with superpowers, was released [[direct-to-video]] in the United States as ''[[Kiara the Brave]]''. Its title and cover art focused on an incidental female character with red hair (i.e. [[Merida (Disney)|Merida]]), in an obvious attempt to evoke the redheaded female protagonist of ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', a Disney/Pixar movie set in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brent Lang|title=Low-Budget 'Kiara the Brave' Capitalizes on Similarities to That Other 'Brave' Cartoon|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/low-budget-cartoon-kiara-brave-plays-similarities-other-brave-film-42841|work=[[The Wrap]]|date= 2012-06-14|accessdate = 2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the knockoff film simply renames an already existing film into a name that is similar to a popular film. For example, ''[[The Legend of Sarila]]'' was renamed ''Frozen Land'' to cash in on Disney's 2013 film, ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.&lt;ref name=cartoon /&gt; In another case, a collection of animated shorts from the 90s animated series, ''[[Britannica's Tales Around the World]]'', was rereleased under ''Tangled Up'' by Brightspark to cash in on Disney's 2010 film, ''[[Tangled]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prentice|first1=Verity|title=Disney threatens legal action against 'copycat' DVDs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9518320/Disney-threatens-legal-action-against-copycat-DVDs.html|accessdate=20 August 2016|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Acuna|first1=Kirsten|title=Disney's Going After A UK Company For These Knockoff Films|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disneys-going-after-a-uk-company-for-these-knockoff-films-2012-9|accessdate=20 August 2016|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brightspark also rereleased the film [[The Adventures of Lolo the Penguin|The Adventures of Scamper the Penguin]] under ''Tappy Feet: The Adventures of Scamper'' to cash in on ''[[Happy Feet]]''.

Asylum CEO David Michael Latt responds to criticisms about loose plot lines by stating that "We don't have spies at the studios. We have a general sense of what the film is and we make our movie completely original, just based on that concept."

Mockbusters are low budget, and their revenue is based entirely on the sales of their DVDs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Author Interviews |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/10/160885513/the-straight-to-dvd-world-of-mockbusters |title=The Straight-To-DVD World Of 'Mockbusters' |publisher=NPR |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low budgets also mean that directors need to think of creative yet cheap ways to achieve the endings that they desire. For example, ''[[Snakes on a Train]]'' capitalized on the Internet hype surrounding ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''.  Consumers wanted what they saw. Latt said, "With only four days left of shooting my partner called and said everyone is really excited about ''Snakes on a Train'', but they’re more excited about the poster, which showed a snake swallowing a train. It was meant to be, you know, metaphorical. But the buyers wanted it, so I was given the mandate that the ending had to have the snake eat the train." At the same time another representative of Asylum, David Rimawi, says that while a handful of their movies do have "artistic elements", that's just not something they're concerned with. The Asylum does not claim to be an "artsy" production house.&lt;ref name="grantland.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8458773/a-look-how-ripoff-factory-called-asylum-makes-mockery-box-office |title=Mockbuster Video « |publisher=Grantland.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundalike titling==
Mockbusters often use a title with a similar-sounding name to the mainstream feature it intends to piggy-back upon. For instance, the 2006 mockbuster ''[[Snakes on a Train]]'' traded on the publicity surrounding the theatrically released ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lou |last=Lumenick |title=''B-list knockoffs of summer hits are fool's gold'' |publisher=''[[The New York Post]]'' |date=July 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the aforementioned film, [[The Asylum]] has also released ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (2009 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'', ''[[Transmorphers]]'', ''[[AVH: Alien vs. Hunter]]'', ''[[The Da Vinci Treasure]]'', ''[[Battle of Los Angeles (film)|Battle of Los Angeles]]'', ''[[Atlantic Rim (film)|Atlantic Rim]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Entity]]''.

==Foreign knockoffs and illegitimate sequels==

Mockbusters and ripoffs are often filmed and released outside of the original movie's country. Low-budget studios in foreign countries may produce completely illegitimate sequels to pre-existing higher budgeted movie series that began in other countries. These sequels are unofficial, and often even unknown to the creators and producers of the original films. These unofficial sequels are rarely, or never, released in the original country, usually due to licensing issues. In other cases, a film released in other countries is renamed as a sequel to another film in contrast to the original title.&lt;ref name="Roland-Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/03/08/some-more-quasi-mockbusters-that-some-people-might-confuse-for-the-real-movie--2-2763248?lt_source=external,manual|title=Some more quasi-mockbusters that some people might confuse for the real movie|last=Roland-Martin|first=Tré|date=9 March 2015|work=[[Moviepilot]]|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Italian directors directed unofficial sequels to [[George A. Romero]]'s 1978 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'': [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi 2]]'' sold itself as the sequel to that film (which was called ''Zombi'' in Italy) and even used a line originally written for ''Dawn of the Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Glenn Kay |title=Zombie Movies |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |page=95 |isbn=1-55652-770-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine film industry is also known for its unauthorised adaptations of popular Western films. The popularity of the ''[[Batman]]'' films, most especially the [[Batman (TV series)|1966 TV series]], has led to numerous unauthorised remakes and pastiches, such as ''[[James Batman]]'' starring comedian [[Dolphy]], ''[[Batman Fights Dracula]]'', and ''[[Alyas Batman en Robin]]''.&lt;ref name="batman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nothingbutcomics.net/2014/05/28/the-unauthorized-batman-films-of-the-1960s/|title=The Unauthorized Batman Films of the 1960s|work=Nothing But Comics|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphy also played leading roles in other mockbusters, including ''Wanted: Perfect Father'', a comedy-drama based on the 1993 film ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'',&lt;ref name="doubtfire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacifiqa.com/entertainment/five-hollywood-filipino-knockoff-films-movies/|title=5 Filipino knock-off versions of Hollywood blockbusters|last=Oca|first=Alysa|work=Pacifiqa|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tataynic'', a 1998 parody of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Other Filipino knockoffs include ''Bobo Cop'' (a parody of ''[[RoboCop]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344944/ |title=''Bobo Cop'' |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rocky Plus V'' (a spoof of the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949519/ |title=''Rocky Plus V'' |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Mockbusters based on popular animated films are known as a "[[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]] opportunity." For example, ''Kiara the Brave'' (a mockbuster of [[Pixar]]'s ''Brave'') and ''Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale'' (a mockbuster of ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'') use soundalike titling to "draft off" the marketing success ("slipstream") of popular films. "Can you trademark an actual noun? The idea of a battleship?," asks Boxoffice magazine editor Amy Nicholson.&lt;ref name="grantland.com"/&gt; The original ''Puss in Boots'' was made by [[DreamWorks Animation]] by 300 people working for four years at the cost of $130 million. The mockbuster, with nearly exactly the same name was made by 12 people, in six months, for less than $1 million. For these large production houses, it wasn't just a question of free riding on the marketing success of these more popular films; mockbusters have become a source of bad publicity. Customers who had accidentally bought the mockbuster ''Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale'' but did not know that it was a mockbuster gave the original movie bad reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-budget knockoff movies benefit from Hollywood blockbusters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/24/business/la-fi-ct-knock-offs-20120624|publisher=LA Times | first=Ben|last=Fritz|date=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mockbuster producers have had no legal troubles with drafting off as a result of Disney losing a case against GoodTimes Entertainment, which had used similar packaging for their own version of ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/arts/home-video-218293.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Peter M. | last=Nichols | title=Home Video | date=September 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mockbusters have also had legal complications with false advertising. They supposedly tweak the plot lines and the titles just enough to skirt legal trouble and yet ride on the publicity of major blockbusters. Until the ''Hobbit'' case, mockbuster production houses have been able to achieve soundalike titling to such an extent that even actors in the movies have been confused about which movie they are starring in. Some actors starring in the original have gone on to become fans of the mockbuster model. [[Kel Mitchell]] was the star in the mockbuster ''[[Battle of Los Angeles (film)|Battle of Los Angeles]]'', the mockbuster to the original ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]''. His friend was in the original and they began promoting both movies together. Kel has since then became a fan of the studio's formula: "I laugh out loud when I see that a film is coming out; I wonder what The Asylum is going to do with it. They're going to remix that name and put it out."&lt;ref name="grantland.com"/&gt;

In December 2013, The Walt Disney Company filed in California federal court to get an injunction against the continued distribution of the French film ''[[The Legend of Sarila]]'', retitled ''Frozen Land''. In their suit, Disney alleges: "To enhance the commercial success of Sarila, the defendant redesigned the artwork, packaging, logo, and other promotional materials for its newly (and intentionally misleadingly) retitled film to mimic those used by [Disney] for ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' and related merchandise." The suit was filed against distributor [[Phase 4 Films]].&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/disney-acts-freeze-competition-6566/|title=Disney Acts To Freeze Out Competition|first=Dave|last=Koch|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=28 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131228175821/http://blog.bcdb.com/disney-acts-freeze-competition-6566/|archivedate=28 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intent to deceive===
Because mockbusters are deliberately similar to more famous movies, some movie studios have sued mockbuster studios for allegedly tricking consumers into renting or purchasing the wrong movie through intentionally deceptive marketing.

In one such lawsuit, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] sued the U.K.-based studio Brightspark, complaining that the studio was "misleading consumers with numerous releases that confuse and undermine the trust those consumers have in Disney." Among Brightspark's films mentioned in the lawsuit were ''Braver'', ''Tangled Up'', ''The Frog Prince'', and ''Little Cars'', which resemble Disney's ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', ''[[Tangled]]'', ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', and ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/06/disney-challenges-uk-film-company-misleading-releases?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rebecca | last=Smithers | title=Disney challenges UK film company over 'misleading' DVDs | date=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warner Bros.]] similarly [[Mockbuster#The Asylum vs. Warner Bros., 2012|sued The Asylum]] over their release of ''Age of the Hobbits''. The judge ruled in favor of Warner Bros., writing that "There is substantial likelihood that consumers will be confused by Age Of Hobbits and mistakenly purchase the film intending to purchase ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/warner-bros-mgm-granted-hobbit-mockbuster-restraining-order/ |title=UPDATE: Warner Bros Hails ‘Hobbit’ Victory Over "Cynical" Mockbuster Producers |publisher=Deadline |date=2012-12-10 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mockbusters follow the trend of releasing their movies close to the release dates of the original:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Community User |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/seancurry1/mockbusters-way-worse-than-the-worst-of-blockbusters |title=Mockbusters: Way Worse Than The Worst Blockbusters |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Jack the Giant Killer (2013 Asylum film)|Jack the Giant Killer]]'' came out on March 12, 2013, ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer]]'' on March 1, 2013.
* ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel (2013 film)|Hansel &amp; Gretel]]'' came out January 8, 2013, ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'' came out January 17, 2013.
* Grimm's ''Snow White'', ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'' and ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'' were all released in 2012.
* 2009's ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' was followed by 2010's ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes]]'' from The Asylum.

The Asylum defend this practice, stating their intention is not to dupe customers. The Asylum cites reports from both [[Blockbuster LLC]] and [[Hollywood Video]] that show that less than 1% of customers who rent one of their films ask for a refund. The fact that the low return rate of their films has been used to argue that consumers are renting The Asylum's movies deliberately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasylum.cc/blog/2011/04/in-defense-of-mockbusters/Asylum |title=blog, "in defense of mockbusters" |publisher=Theasylum.cc |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There's a segment of people who watch them because they know they're bad and they're funny, and they're fun to make fun of with their friends," says Kyle Ryan, the managing editor of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', a sister publication of ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

===''The Asylum v. Warner Bros.'', 2012===
In 2012, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[New Line Cinema]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[WingNut Films]], and The [[Saul Zaentz]] Company (SZC) sued The Asylum for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, false advertising, and unfair competition. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant's movie title "Age of the Hobbits" infringed the registered trademarks held by SZC in the designation "Hobbit." Unlike fairytales, which are in the public domain, the [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] novels have been exclusively licensed to Warner Bros. and SZC for production and film adaptation. The court described Global Asylum (the defendant in this case) as a low budget company that makes "mockbusters" of popular movies with similar titling. Warner Bros. and SZC submitted evidence to prove that consumers would be confused by the identical title and that they would lose not only ticket sales but also DVD revenue. The evidence included a survey showing that 48 percent of 400 surveyed respondents associated the term “Hobbit” with SZC, d/b/a “Tolkien Enterprises” and Tolkien properties. A separate survey conducted by Nielsen National Research Group showed that approximately 16 to 24 percent of survey respondents were confused about the source of ''[[Clash of the Empires|Age of the Hobbits]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trademark Suit Blocks "Age of the Hobbits" Mockbuster Release|url=http://sullivanlaw.net/age-of-hobbits-mockbuster-film-debut-blocked-by-court/|publisher=Sullivan Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asylum claimed that they were justified in using the word "[[Hobbit]]" as a fair use of scientific terminology after some scientists borrowed the term from the ''Hobbit'' stories a few years prior to describe a human subspecies in [[Indonesia]]. The Asylum argued that it provided warnings stating that this was not the Tolkien creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hobbit-movie-producers-sue-age-387585 |title='The Hobbit' Producers Sue 'Age of the Hobbits' Studio for Trademark Infringement (Exclusive) |author=Belloni, Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films also featured major plot differences: "In an ancient age, the small, peace-loving Hobbits are enslaved by the [[Java Man|Java Men]], a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders. The young Hobbit Goben must join forces with their neighbor giants, the humans, to free his people and vanquish their enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blastr.com/2012/11/warner-bros-officially-tr.php |title=Warner Bros. officially trying to kill that Hobbit mockbuster  |author=Moore, Trent |publisher=''blastr'' |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Court found that Warner Bros. had a valid trademark on the word "Hobbit". The court rejected The Asylum's scientific fair use claims since there was no evidence to suggest that the movie was about prehistoric group of people who lived in Indonesia. The court rejected all of The Asylum's defenses: (i) that it was permitted to use “Hobbits” in the title of its film pursuant to the free speech test of the Second Circuit’s decision in ''[[Rogers v. Grimaldi]]'', (ii) that its use of the mark constituted nominative fair use to indicate plaintiffs' movies and (iii) that the “Hobbits” mark was a generic name. The court decided that The Asylum had failed to prove its defenses and on December 10, 2012, found in favor of the plaintiffs and entered a temporary restraining order. This restraining order prevented the use by Global Asylum of the title ''Age of the Hobbits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loeb.com/news/CaseList.aspx?Type=ip&amp;case=1936 |title=IP/Entertainment Law Weekly Case Update for Motion Picture Studios and Television Networks |publisher=Loeb &amp; Loeb, LP |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000224/http://www.loeb.com/news/CaseList.aspx?Type=ip&amp;case=1936 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninth Circuit court of appeals affirmed in 2013. The film was then released under the name ''[[Clash of the Empires]]''.

==Pornographic movies==
Successful films frequently spawn pornographic knock-offs with punned titles. Examples include: ''Gilligan's Bi-Land'' (''[[Gilligan's Island]]''), ''Edward Penishands'' (''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''), ''Kinky Kong'' (''[[King Kong]]''), ''Foreskin Gump'' (''[[Forrest Gump]]''), ''Raiders of the Lost Arse'' (''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''), ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'' (''[[Flash Gordon]]''), and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (''[[The Devil and Miss Jones]]'').

Some pornographic movies are mockbusters of other pornographic movies. For example, the 1985 film ''[[Black Throat]]'' is a mockbuster of an earlier, popular pornographic film, 1972's ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. Pornographic films are particularly prone to unauthorized sequels; ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'', a 1978 porn film, spawned at least eleven sequels, most of which were never explicitly authorized by the original production team or cast.

==In other media==
The term has also been used for media besides film, such as video games capitalizing on the success of a known franchise like ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' or ''[[Call of Duty]]''. A notable example of this are games developed by the French studio [[Gameloft]].&lt;ref name="gameloftmockbuster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/th+best+thing+ever/gameloft-the-asylum-of-games-217428.phtml|title=Gameloft: The Asylum of Games - Destructoid|publisher=Destructoid|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the games in their portfolio bear similarities to popular video game series, with reviewers commenting about ''Gameloft''’s emulation of those games experiences brought onto mobile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/gameloft-at-peace-with-copycat-reputation/|title=Gameloft at peace with copycat reputation|work=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cloning"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-11-gameloft-answers-game-cloning-charge|title=Gameloft answers game cloning charge|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2013/11/14/what-do-you-think-about-heavily-inspired-games-like-oceanhorn/|title=What Do You Think About "Heavily Inspired" Games Like 'Oceanhorn'?|last=Nelson|first=Jared|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Antigua and Barbuda''' is a museum in [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda]]. It is housed in the colonial Court House, constructed in 1747 on the site of the first city market, and is the oldest building still in use in the city. The museum displays both [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] and colonial artifacts recovered on archaeological digs on the islands. It also features a life-sized replica of an Arawak house, models of sugar plantations, along with a history of the island, and [[Viv Richards]]' cricket bat.

{{Culture of Ecuador}}
The '''music of Ecuador ''' has a long history. Pasillo is a genre of indigenous Latin music. It is extremely popular in Ecuador, where it is the "national genre of music." Pasillo as a genre is also present in the highland regions of Colombia and to a lesser extent, Panama and Venezuela.

Today, it has incorporated more European features of classical dance, such as waltz. As it spread during the Gran Chaco period, pasillo also absorbed the individual characteristics of isolated villages. This gives it an eclectic feel; however, the style, tone, and tempo of the music differ in each village.

In its waltz, pasillo alters the classically European dance form to accompany guitar, mandolin, and other string instruments.

The [[pacific]] coast of Ecuador is known for the [[Amorfino]], a popular type of song, as well as a variety of dance music.

[[Pasillo]], [[Pasacalle]], and Yarabi are popular styles of folksong.  the latter being similar to a [[flute]], and is usually downtempo; it is descended from the [[waltz]]. Pasacalle is a form of [[dance music]], while the sentimental Yarabi is probably the most popular form in Ecuador.

==Andean music (La Sierra)==
The mountainous, Andean region of Ecuador, the Sierra, is home to a style of music called {{ill|Sanjuanito|es}}. The music of the [[Otavalo people]] is well known worldwide. A small [[panpipe]] called the ''[[rondador]]'' is the most distinctive instrument, but ensembles are typically groups of [[wind instrument]]s, [[guitar]] trios, or [[brass band]]s. Folk rhythms include ''cachullapi'', ''yumbo'', and danzante.
Musicians like Huayanay have helped to popularize Andean-Ecuadoran music.

== Afro ecuadorian music ==
[[Afro-Ecuadorians|Afro-Ecuadorian]] music is mainly of two types. ''Marimba'' music comes from Esmeraldas, and gets its name from the prominent use of ''[[marimba]]''s, along with drums and other instruments specific to this region such as the ''bombo'', the ''cununo'' and the ''wasa''. Sometimes this music is played in religious ceremonies, as well as in celebrations and parties. It features call and response chanting along with the music. Some of the rhythms associated with it are ''currulao'', ''bambuco'' and ''andarele''.

On the other hand, in the Chota Valley there is ''[[bomba (Ecuador)|bomba]]'' music. This music is very different from ''marimba'', having a more prominent Spanish, ''mestizo'' and indigenous influence. It can vary from mid tempo to a very fast rhythm. It is usually played with guitars, as well as the main local instrument called ''bomba'', which is a drum, along with a ''guiro'', and sometimes ''bombos'' and ''bongos''. A variation of it played by ''la banda mocha'', groups who play ''bomba'' with a ''bombo'', ''guiro'' and plant leaves to give melody. Soca music is popular in Esmeraldas 

Religious practice among afro-Ecuadorians is usually Roman Catholic. There is no significant African religion, although Catholic worship is distinctive in Esmeraldas, and sometimes is done with ''marimba'' music.

==Folk instruments==
*[[cunuca]]: a [[percussion instrument]] similar to a [[conga drum]]
*[[bombos]]
*[[conuno]]
*[[pinkillu]]: a wind instrument similar to a wooden recorder. Native to the [[Quichua]] people in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] province

==Music institutions==
The [[Fundación de Desarrollo Social Afroecuatoriano]] (AZUCAR) has existed since 1993, and offers a variety of workshops for all ages in music and dance, as well as handicrafts and other topics. More information can be found on their website [https://archive.is/20130125034031/http://www.goecuador.com/mp3/azucar.html here].

===Music festivals===
Ecuador has many annual festivals, with nearly every village celebrating a [[Roman Catholic Saint]].  The [http://www.galapagos-islands-tourguide.com/ecuador-music.html annual festival in August] held in [[San Antonio de Pichincha]] is particularly well known, as is the independent music festival Quito Fest.

The '''National Bullying Helpline''' was a charity organisation established by David and Christine Pratt, promising to service the needs of victims of bullying, based in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]]. After closing in 2011, it reopened as a privately run, national, advice centre in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalbullyinghelpline.co.uk/about.htm|title= ABOUT US|publisher=National Bullying Helpline|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original charity==
The National Bullying [[helpline]] was founded in 2007.&lt;ref name="Belfast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/bully-helpline-in-brown-row-closes-28580238.html|title=Bully helpline in Brown row closes|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they encouraged National Ban Bullying day on 7 November, and National Ban Bullying week starting on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/national-bullying-helpline-campaign-will-continue/#.UASfxY7qtSU|title=National Bullying Helpline campaign will continue|publisher=Personnel Today|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, National Bullying Helpline caused controversy by alleging that three or four members of [[Gordon Brown]]'s colleagues had phoned them for advice.&lt;ref name="The Week"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/16449/bullying-helpline-chief-%E2%80%98breached-confidentiality%E2%80%99|title= Bullying Helpline chief ‘breached confidentiality’|publisher=The Week|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as a breach of their confidentiality,&lt;ref name="Third"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/national-bullying-helpline-condemned-breach-confidentiality-no-10-complaints/governance/article/985472|title=National Bullying Helpline condemned for breach of confidentiality over No 10 complaints|publisher=Third Sector|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused the resignation of all four patrons of the organisation.&lt;ref name="Third"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8527881.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe resigns from charity over 'bullying' row|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/22/national-bullying-helpline-patrons-resign| title=National Bullying Helpline under fire as patrons resign|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy came when it was revealed that Christine Pratt herself had been involved in racist bullying of another staff member, and that the National Bullying Helpline itself was under investigation by the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] for submitting accounts late, taking advantage of its clients through exhorting money, and finding clients for David Pratt's HR company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/christine-pratt-the-chequered-past-and-tangled-present-of-woman-at-the-centre-of-the-bullying-storm-1907373.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/22/profile-christine-pratt-bullying-helpline|title= Profile: Christine Pratt and the National Bullying Helpline|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt later resigned as a result,&lt;ref name="The Week"/&gt; the organisation was temporarily suspended,&lt;ref name="Shut"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-12130984|title= National Bullying Helpline closes down|publisher=BBC News|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation was investigated by the Charity Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/26/national-bullying-helpline-inquiry| title=Charity Commission opens inquiry into National Bullying Helpline|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 February 2010|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt subsequently told Swindon Link, a free news publication delivered to 25000 homes around Swindon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://swindonlink.com/about-us|title= Swindon Link|date=9 June 2016|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the investigation had exonerated her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://swindonlink.com/2015/04/national-bullying-hotline-founder-exonerated/|title= National bullying hotline founder exonerated|publisher=Swindon Link|date=7 April 2015|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, it was announced that the organisation was to close down, due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name="Shut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfast"/&gt;

==Private Firm==
In 2012, National Bullying Helpline reopened as a privately run, national, advice centre in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalbullyinghelpline.co.uk/about.htm|title= ABOUT US|publisher=National Bullying Helpline|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">Many cultures around the world have stories about groups of '''nine women'''. In Great Britain they occur in a variety of situations. In Scotland there are references to '''Nine Maidens''', purportedly a group of,&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, AP. ''Kalendars of Scottish Saints'' 1872, Edinburgh, p420&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of wells dedicated to them,&lt;ref&gt;Mackinlay, J F. ''Traces of the Cultus of the Nine Maidens'' Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1910 pp255-65&lt;/ref&gt; but like all similar groupings would appear to have had their origin in pre-Christian times. In [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian material]], the best known of these groups are the [[Nine sorceresses]], [[Morgan le Fay|Morgan]] and her sisters who live on the [[Avalon|Isle of Avalon]] and are both seeresses and healers.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, JJ. ''The Vita Merlini'' 1925, University of Illinois Press, p27&lt;/ref&gt; Another group occur in the Welsh tale of [[Peredur son of Efrawg]], and these are the armed witches of Caer Lyow.&lt;ref&gt;Jones,G &amp; Jones T. 1993, ''The Mabinogion Everyman'' p164&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Welsh mythology, we have nine maidens who tend the fire below the Cauldron of the "Chief of [[Annwfn]]"; this cauldron is the target of Arthur’s raid on the Underworld in [[Taliesin|Taliesin’s]] famous poem [[Preiddeu Annwfn]].

==Iceland==

Groups of Nine Maidens crop up in the Icelandic tales of Thidrandi&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. ''Eirik the Red and other Icelandic Sagas'' 1961, Oxford University Press, p160&lt;/ref&gt; and in Brand’s saga, in the story of [[Svipdagr]], as [[Valkyrie]]s &lt;ref&gt;Grimm, J. 1880-88, ''Teutonic Mythology'' vol 1, p421&lt;/ref&gt; and as the daughters of the sea goddess [[Rán]].

==Norse mythology==

In Norse mythology, the watcher god of [[Valhalla]], [[Heimdallr]] is said to be born of nine mothers,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, HRE. 1990, ''Gods and Myths of Northern Europe'' p175&lt;/ref&gt; and they are also associated with the World-Mill which created the known universe from the bodies of the Ice Giants slain by [[Odin]] and his companions.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, DA. 1995, ''Teutonic Myth and Legend Senate'' p4&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea-god [[Njörðr]] and the [[Jötunn|jotun]] [[Ægir]] (whose domain is also the sea) each have nine daughters.

==England==

The Anglo-Saxon Charm Against a Kernel refers to a character called Noðþe with nine sisters.

==Ireland==

An echo of the daughters of [[Rán]] appears in the Irish tale of Ruad, Son of Rig-Donn, in which he is stopped at sea by nine giant maidens with whom he has a child.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn, E. (ed),1903-35, ''The Metrical Dinshenchas'' Royal Irish Academy, vol 2, p27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the attendants at St Brigid’s sacred fire at Kildare are sometimes said to be nine, though sometimes nineteen. [[Brigid]] also is said to have gone to Scotland with Nine Maidens to found Abernethy, just as [[Monenna]] is said to have come from Ireland with nine female companions.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes. AP. 1872, ''Kalendars of Scottish Saints' Edinburgh, p404&lt;/ref&gt; St Brigid appears to have been modelled on the earlier goddess figure [[Brigid|Brìde]], who was also indigenous to Scotland &lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, H. 1949, ''Early Scotland'' Cambridge, pxii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. 1888-95, ''Historie of Scotland'' Vol. 1, p229&lt;/ref&gt; and may well have been the tutelary goddess of the [[Brigantes]] in North West England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighid.org.uk/england2.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beyond Britain, the nine occur in the Breton story of the [[Korrigan]],&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;Spence, L. 1977(repr), ''The Legends and Romances of Brittany'' London, p59&lt;/ref&gt; who along with her nine attendants lured unwary men to their deaths and in the  tradition of the Gallicenae; the Nine Maidens&lt;ref name="Spence" /&gt; who lived on the Isle du Sein, latterly known as the Isle of the Druidesses.

==Greek Mythology==

In Greek mythology, the [[Muse]]s were originally thought to have been a whole series of different groups who, like their counterparts in Scotland, are associated with mountains and wells.&lt;ref&gt;McHardy, SA. 2003, ''The Quest for the Nine Maidens'' Edinburgh, p123 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Graves in ''The Greek Myths'' drew attention to a similarity between groups of ecstatic [[Maenad]]s and the cave painting form [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul Roca Dels Moros]] near [[Lleida|Lerida]] in [[Catalonia]] which has nine women dancing round a spectacularly priapic male.

==Kenya==

In Kenya, the [[Kikuyu people]] claim descent from nine sisters &lt;ref&gt;Kenyatta, J. 1979, ''Facing Mount Kenya: The Traditional Life of the Gikuyu'' London, p3&lt;/ref&gt; who, like many other such groupings, are associated with a mountain – [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] - and a single powerful male figure.

==Female figures linked to groups of nine women==

[[Brigid|Brìde]] – goddess in England, Ireland and Scotland who was the origin of the Irish St Brigid

[[Cailleach]] – The Winter Hag aspect of the Mother Goddess in Scotland. Similarly known in Ireland

[[Cerridwen]] – the Welsh Goddess who had a cauldron of poetry and inspiration

[[Moninne|Monenna]] – an early Scottish saint who supposedly had chapels on Dumbarton, Edinburgh and Stirling Rocks, and Traprain Law – all important Dark Age sites.

[[Morgan le Fay|Morgan]] - the leader of the nine sisters of Avalon linked to King Arthur.

[[Rán]] - Norse goddess of the sea

==Male figures associated with groups of nine women==

*[[King Arthur]] – the medieval romantic once and future king was based on earlier legendary material amongst P-Celtic peaking peoples of north west Europe. Including in Scotland.
*''Gikuyu'' - traditional founder of the [[Kikuyu people]] of Kenya.
*[[Heimdallr]] – the watcher god of Asgard and the progenitor of the human species.
*[[Njörðr]] - god of the sea.

'''Odds''' are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers,  used  in both [[gambling]] and [[statistics]]. In statistics, the '''odds for''' or '''odds of''' some [[event (probability theory)|event]] reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while '''odds against''' reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event.&lt;ref name=FultonMendez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldin/&gt; Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.

In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a [[Gambling|wager]] or bet.&lt;ref name=OxDict/&gt; Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a [[bookmaker]]) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the "1" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the "6" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.

In statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the [[probability]] of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the [[uncertainty]] of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a [[calculation]]. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling a three with a fair die (one of a pair of [[dice]]) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 three event for every 5 times the die does not show three (i.e., a 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6). For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 threes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a three with a fair die are 5 to 1. The [[probability]] of rolling a three with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.

The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a [[fair value|fair]] one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a three will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a three and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on [[average]], five rolls result in something other than a three, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a three and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. [[Casino|Casinos]], for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the [[Table tennis|ping-pong]] ball method used in state lotteries in the [[United States]]. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a [[football]] match.

==History==
The language of odds, such as the use of phrases like "ten to one" for [[intuition|intuitively]] estimated risks, is found in the sixteenth century, well before the development of [[probability theory]].&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] wrote:

{{quote|
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas&lt;br /&gt;
That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one
|[[William Shakespeare]]|''[[Henry IV, Part II]]'', Act I,  Scene 1 lines 181–2.
}}

The sixteenth-century [[polymath]] [[Cardano]] demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes. Implied by this definition is the fact that the probability of an event is given by the [[ratio]] of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some%20Laws.pdf ''Some laws and problems in classical probability and how Cardano anticipated them'' Gorrochum, P. ''Chance'' magazine 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Odds are expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a [[symbol]] for ease of use. This is conventionally either a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] or [[hyphen]], although a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] is sometimes seen. Thus, &lt;math&gt;6/1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;6-1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;6:1&lt;/math&gt; are all interchangeable.

===Odds against===

When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 ''against''". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.

===Odds on===

"Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 ''on''"), meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.

===Even odds===
{{main|Even money}}
"Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing [[heads or tails]] on a [[coin toss]] is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as "[[even money]]" or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake; that is, "double your money".

====Better than/worse than evens====
The meaning of the term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") depends on context. From the perspective of a gambler rather than a [[statistician]], "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1:1), betting 10 units would return 20 units for profit of 10 units. A successful gamble paying out at 4:1 would return 50 units for a profit of 40 units. So this wager is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one for one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the [[bookmaker]] will pay out less than one for one.

However, in [[vernacular|popular parlance]] surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a greater than 50-percent chance of an event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.

==Statistical usage==

In statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds ''in favor''. The odds (in favor) of an [[event (probability theory)|event]] or a [[proposition]] is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a [[Bernoulli trial]], as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite [[sample space]] of [[equally likely outcomes]], this is the ratio of the number of [[Outcome (probability)|outcomes]] where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as ''W'' and ''L'' (for Wins and Losses) or ''S'' and ''F'' (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a [[random variable|randomly chosen]] day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelman/&gt; Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities: &lt;math&gt;2:5 = (2/7):(5/7).&lt;/math&gt; Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.

Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions ''to'' and ''in:'' "odds of so many ''to'' so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to ''odds'' – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], ''in'' so many [outcomes]" refers to ''probability'' – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 ''to'' 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 ''in'' 7". In casual use, the words ''odds'' and ''chances'' (or ''chance'') are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is ''to'' or ''in''.&lt;ref name=Powerball/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfram2/&gt;

===Mathematical relations===
Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] can represent the same [[rational number]]). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.

Given odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number) &lt;math&gt;o_f&lt;/math&gt; and odds against (as a number) &lt;math&gt;o_a&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by simply dividing, and are [[multiplicative inverse]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
o_f &amp;= W/L = 1/o_a\\
o_a &amp;= L/W = 1/o_f\\
o_f \cdot o_a &amp;= 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to [[Unity (mathematics)|unity]] (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p &amp;= W/(W+L) = 1 - q\\
q &amp;= L/(W+L) = 1 - p\\
p + q &amp;= 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Given a probability ''p,'' the odds as a ratio is &lt;math&gt;p:q&lt;/math&gt; (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
o_f &amp;= p/q = p/(1-p) = (1-q)/q\\
o_a &amp;= q/p = (1-p)/p = q/(1-q)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, given the odds as a number &lt;math&gt;o_f,&lt;/math&gt; this can be represented as the ratio &lt;math&gt;o_f:1,&lt;/math&gt; or conversely &lt;math&gt;1:(1/o_f) = 1:o_a,&lt;/math&gt; from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p &amp;= o_f/(o_f+1) = 1/(o_a + 1)\\
q &amp;= o_a/(o_a+1) = 1/(o_f + 1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 ''in'' 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 ''to'' 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0.{{overline|01}}), while odds of 1 ''to'' 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 ''in'' 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0.{{overline|0099}}). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or "long odds"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).

These are worked out for some simple odds:
{| class=wikitable
| odds (ratio) || &lt;math&gt;o_f&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;o_a&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;

|}

These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all [[Möbius transformation]]s (fractional linear transformations). They are thus [[Möbius transformation#Specifying a transformation by three points|specified by three points]] ([[Sharply multiply transitive|sharply 3-transitive]]). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence [[circular transform]]s. Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a [[parabolic transform]].

===Applications===
In [[probability theory]] and [[Bayesian statistics]], odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a '''last specific event''' which is solved by the [[odds algorithm]]. Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the [[Bayes factor]].

The odds are a [[ratio]] of probabilities; an [[odds ratio]] is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities.  Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of [[clinical trial]]s.  While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter-[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times ''more likely'' to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the ''odds'' are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 ''against'', or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 ''on'', or 0.25).

In some cases the [[log-odds]] are used, which is the [[logit]] of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.

;Example #1: There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?

Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 ''against''.  There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], where the variable ''p'' is the [[probability]] in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1-''p'', "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or  &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{1-p}&lt;/math&gt;. That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.

In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, "the odds" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as ''p'' are &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-p}{p}&lt;/math&gt;.
The odds against Sunday are 6:1 or &amp;nbsp;6/1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.

==Gambling usage==

The use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a [[coin toss]] or a [[match race]] between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.

In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a [[bookmaker]], and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as "odding", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.

===Fractional odds===
Favoured by [[bookmaker]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], and also common in [[horse racing]], fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake.&lt;ref name=Goal/&gt; Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake.  If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as ''evens'' or ''even money''.

The [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of fractional odds are always [[integer]]s, thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the [[lowest common denominator]]. For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.

Fractional odds are also known as ''British odds,'' ''UK odds,''&lt;ref name=wbx/&gt; or, in that country, ''traditional odds''. They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A variation of fractional odds is known as ''Hong Kong'' odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.

The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2).&lt;ref name=SW1/&gt;

===Decimal odds===
Favoured in continental [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, ''including'' the original stake, to the stake itself.&lt;ref name=TBR/&gt;  Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one.&lt;ref name=Betstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractional Odds|url=http://betstarter.com/sportsbetting/Fractionalodds.asp#3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402082613/http://betstarter.com/SportsBetting/FractionalOdds.asp/ |archivedate=2014-04-02 |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00.  The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25.  This is considered to be ideal for [[Parlay (gambling)|parlay]] betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on.  Decimal odds are also favoured by [[betting exchanges]] because they are the easiest to work with for trading, as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome.&lt;ref name=Cortis/&gt; For example, a quoted odds of 5.00 equals to a probability of 1 / 5.00, that is 0.20 or 20%.

Decimal odds are also known as ''European odds'', ''digital odds'' or ''continental odds.''&lt;ref name=wbx/&gt;

===Moneyline odds===
{{main|moneyline odds}}
Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers.  The figure quoted is either positive or negative.
* When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.
* When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome that is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.

Moneyline odds are often referred to as ''American odds''. A "moneyline" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a [[Spread betting|point spread]]. In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, ''both'' teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g,. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.

===Wholesale odds===
Wholesale odds are the "real [[odds]]" or 100% probability of an event occurring. This 100% book is displayed without any [[bookmaker]]'s [[profit margin]], often referred to as a bookmaker's "[[overround]]" built in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crawford |first1=Hicks |title=How Betting Odds Are Determined |url=https://ed.ted.com/on/cTH8zSi7#digdeeper |website=TED.com |publisher=TED-Ed |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The book price is effectively a measure of the competitiveness of the odds prices on offer.

A "wholesale odds" [[Index (economics)|index]] is an index of all the prices in a probabilistic market operating at 100% competitiveness and displayed without any profit margin factored for market participants.

==Gambling odds versus probabilities==
{{Main|Mathematics of bookmaking}}

In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the [[bookmaker]] will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful [[gambler|bettor]] is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:

In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.

In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an [[Mathematics of bookmaking|overround]] of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the [[expected value]] of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.

A study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Lisandro Kaunitz et al.|title=Beating the bookies with their own numbers — and how the sports betting market is rigged|date=Oct 2017|arxiv=1710.02824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making a profit in [[gambling]] involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. [[Sports information service]]s are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.

The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events.  They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee ("vig" or [[vigorish]]).

Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.

'''Philos Laboratories''' (also known as Philos Laboratories Software Developer Ltd. or Philos Labs and later Philos Entertainment, Inc) was a Hungarian computer software development company known for working with producer [[Ubisoft]] and [[CDV Software Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingexcellence.com/companies/119/index.shtml  Philos Labs Company Profile at GamingExcellence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1995 by John (Zsolt) Vamosi, working mostly on making graphics for advertisements. In 1997, several developers of the game ''[[Perihelion: The Prophecy]]'' were hired, and they started making their first title, what would become [[Theocracy (computer game)|Theocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/philos  Zsolt Vamosi of Philos Labs Interview - Eurogamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was disbanded in 2004.

The '''Players Ball''' is an annual gathering of [[pimps]], held in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Other Players Balls take place across the country, most notably in [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]]. Presently, there are "Players Ball" events in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. On December 16-18th 2011, a Players Ball was hosted in [[Hollywood, CA]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playersball.com/ |title=The Players Ball Hollywood 2011 presented by Bishop Don Magic Juan, Snoop Dogg, &amp; Serious Pimp - Chuuuch!!! |publisher=Playersball.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614191923/http://playersball.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Bishop Don Juan Players Ball==
The 38th annual official Players Ball 2012 was held Saturday December 8, 2012 at the Key Club, Hollywood, Ca. Nick Cannon was the Dj for the event who is rumored to be in production filming a movie about Bishop Don Juan.

The 35th Anniversary of the Players Ball, was held on Saturday, December 5, 2009 at Chez Roues Banquet Hall in [[Chicago, IL]]. Ditch performed his first Players Ball show there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUDAxa7g1QY |title=Ditch Bishop Don Juan Other Players In Hotel Room Chicago Il.Wmv |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea stemmed from a scene in the 1973 [[blaxploitation]] film, ''[[The Mack]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070350/ The Mack (1973) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the lead character, a [[pimp]] named Goldie, attends The Players Ball in [[Oakland, California]].   Comedian [[Dan Aykroyd]] parodied this event in his film [[Doctor Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085450/ Doctor Detroit (1983) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dave Chappelle]] satirized the event with "The Playa Haters' Ball" on an episode of [[The Chappelle Show]].  The party has been a November tradition since 1974, when pimps from across the country gathered to celebrate the birthday of Don Juan now known as [[Don "Magic" Juan|Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]]. Every year, the award for "Pimp of the Year" is given out. Juan was the winner 13 years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowling |first=Denise |url=http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/01/29/pimps/ |title="Pimpin' is hard work" - Salon.com |publisher=Archive.salon.com |date=2000-01-29 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
The Player's Ball was shown in the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[Pimps Up, Ho's Down]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214005/ Pimps Up, Ho's Down (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hughes Brothers]]' documentary, ''[[American Pimp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179074/ American Pimp (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD entitled Master Players Ball was also released in 2006. The DVD featured live scenes from a "Players Ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Players-Ball-Various/dp/B000FFP12W |title=Masters Players Ball: Various: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===2003 arrests===
In 2015, the Players Ball took place in [[Atlanta, GA]]. A former prostitute by the name of "Tina F." reported that several [[pimp]]s were arrested for having [[Prostitution of children|underage prostitutes]], and claimed "Two years ago in Atlanta, they stopped it and arrested 15 pimps and charged them. One pimp had a 10-year-old girl in his stable." &lt;ref name="tribe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribes.tribe.net/humantrafficking/thread/6856dd15-bc5f-410d-95ab-c12b4e9d8038 |title=Stop Glamorizing Pain - Stop Glamori... - Human Trafficking - tribe.net |publisher=Tribes.tribe.net |date=2005-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 protest===
In 2005, a former prostitute identifying herself as "Brenda Myers-Powell." protested the Players Ball event at Mariella's Banquet Hall on 5th Avenue in [[Maywood, IL]]. Brenda called the event a "ball for child molesters" because she began being trafficked by pimps at the age of 14 and says her experience is a common one.&lt;ref name="tribe1"/&gt;

===Matthew Thompkins indictment===
In 2006, Matthew Thompkins, a former Postal Worker of [[Manhattanville]], NY, was indicted. He was a former "Pimp of the Year" of the annual Players Ball. His aliases included; "Knowledge" and "Daddy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1129189101.html?dids=1129189101:1129189101&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+2006&amp;author=JEANE+MacINTOSH&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc='PIMP+OF+THE+YEAR'+-+POSTAL+WORKER+BUSTED&amp;pqatl=google |title=Archives - New York Post Online Edition |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While searching his property, Police located two "Pimp of the Year" awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1182229C22A32448&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
A well-known non-pimp Players Ball started in 1999 was thrown in Las Vegas and New Orleans as a private party for businesses attending adult oriented events. The event is organized by D-Money.  The event was thrown twice a year and may coincide with other adult events such as AVN or Internext Expo.  The last players ball event thrown by D-money, who has officially ended the events, was on June 9, 2010.  Official Website http://www.theplayersball.com

===Memphis, Tennessee===
In 2011, the annual Memphis Players Ball was also attended by [[Don "Magic" Juan|Bishop Don Magic Juan]], Good Game, MattShizzle, Candyman, The Black Hef and others. Ditch performed at the Memphis Ball which was located at a mansion in Memphis, TN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3365">{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodern theatre''' is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[philosophy]] that originated in Europe in the middle of the twentieth century. Postmodern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Postmodern techniques==
A postmodern theatrical production might make use of some or all of the following techniques:

# The accepted norms of seeing and representing the world are challenged and disregarded, while experimental theatrical perceptions and representations are created.
# A [[pastiche]] of different textualities and [[Media (arts)|media]] forms are used, including the simultaneous use of multiple [[art]] or media forms, and there is the 'theft' of a heterogeneous group of artistic forms.
# The narrative needs not be complete but can be broken, [[paradox]]ical and imagistic. There is a movement away from linearity to multiplicity (to inter-related webs of stories), where acts and scenes give way to a series of peripatetic dramatic moments.
# Characters are fragmented, forming a collection of contrasting and parallel shards stemming from a central idea, theme or traditional character.
# Each new performance of a theatrical pieces is a new [[wiktionary:Gestalt|Gestalt]], a unique spectacle, with no intent on methodically repeating a play.
# The audience is integral to the shared [[meaning-making]] of the performance process and its members are included in the dialogue of the play.
# There is a rejection of the notions of "High" and "Low" art. The production exists only in the viewer's mind as what the viewer interprets - nothing more and nothing less.
# The rehearsal process in a theatrical production is driven more by shared meaning-making and improvisation, rather than the scripted text.
# The play steps back from reality to create its own self-conscious atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as [[metatheatre]].

While these techniques are often found in postmodern productions they are never part of a centralised movement or style.  Rather, they are tools for authentic introspection, questioning and representation of human experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8392">The '''priming''' theory states that [[Multimedia|media]] images [[association (psychology)|stimulate related thoughts]] in the minds of audience members.&lt;ref name="SLD"&gt;Straubhaar, LaRose, Davenport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grounded in [[cognitive psychology]], the theory of media priming is derived from the associative network model of human memory, in which an idea or concept is stored as a node in the network and is related to other ideas or concepts by semantic paths.  Priming refers to the activation of a node in this network, which may serve as a filter, an interpretive frame, or a premise for further information processing or judgment formation.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Z. &amp; Kosicki, G.M. (1997). Priming and Media Impact on the Evaluations of the President's Performance. Communication Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General aggression model==
The '''general aggression model''' ('''GAM''') integrates the priming theory with the [[social learning theory]] to describe how previously learned violent behavior may be triggered by thoughts, emotions, or physiological states provoked by media exposure.&lt;ref name=SLD/&gt;  However, the GAM has come under considerable criticism in recent years regarding underlying and unproven assumptions and poor data support for the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson &amp; Dyck|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|year=2012|volume=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political media priming==
[[Political media]] priming is "the process in which the media attend to some issues and not others and thereby alter the standards by which people evaluate election candidates".&lt;ref&gt;Severin &amp; Tankard, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that there is a dimension of powerful media effects that goes beyond agenda setting. In 1982, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder first identified this added dimension as the “[[Priming (psychology)|priming effect]].”&lt;ref name="Iyengar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder|title=Experimental Demonstrations of the "Not-So-Minimal" Consequences of Television News Programs|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1982|volume=76|issue=4|pages=848–858|doi=10.2307/1962976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is founded on the assumption that people do not have elaborate knowledge about political matters and do not take into account all of what they do know when making political decisions — they must consider what more readily comes to mind. Through drawing attention to some aspects of politics at the expense of others, the media might help to set the terms by which political judgments are reached, including evaluations of political figures.&lt;ref&gt;Alger, D.E.  (1989).  The Media and Politics.  New Jersey:  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that priming is often discussed in tandem with [[agenda-setting theory]]. The reason for this association is two-fold. The first, per Hastie &amp; Park, is that both theories revolve around salient information recall, operating on the idea that people will use information that is most readily available when making decisions. The second, per Iyengar and Kinder, is that priming is latter part of a two-fold process with agenda-setting that takes place over time. Once agenda setting has made an issue salient, priming is the process by which "mass media can... shape the considerations that people take into account when making judgements about political candidates or issues". In short, both theories point to ease of accessibility of information in one's mind but priming is something that can occur over a period of time after exposure to a given media segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheufele &amp; Tewksbury|title=Framing, Agenda Setting, and Priming: The Evolution of Three Media Effects Models|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|pages=9–20|doi=10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Priming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro demonstrate in a quantitative and historical analysis of [[John F. Kennedy]]’s [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential campaign]]. Their research extends the application of priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions to the study of candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, "changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters". Priming can be an effective [[political campaign|campaign]] strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of [[public opinion]] on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to use position taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs and Shapiro (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study of priming, they set out to determine what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president [[Jimmy Carter]]. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's attention and perception of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.&lt;ref name="Iyengar"/&gt;

The comprehensive Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation&lt;ref name=law/&gt; was enacted in 2008. It punishes the trafficking of people, the managing of prostitutes and the maintaining of a brothel, as well as soliciting in public and distributing pornography. The mere act of exchanging sex for money is not outlawed.

The [[Women’s Network for Unity]] is a Cambodian [[sex worker]] organization which was established in 2000. It lobbies for legal and human rights and better working conditions for sex workers and aims to amend the 2008 law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex work in Cambodia|author=Paula Stromberg|date=4 March 2012|website=DailyXtra|url=http://dailyxtra.com/canada/news/sex-work-in-cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sexual exchange has existed in Cambodia for centuries, but the events of the 20th century created a very unstable situation. During the [[Khmer Rouge]] years (1975–1979) prostitution was completely banned and punishable by death resulting in its virtual elimination in a highly authoritarian social system. Under the new [[PRK/SOC|State of Cambodia]] (1979–1993) commercial sex started to re-emerge. After the dismantlement of the State of Cambodia, about 20,000 male troops and civilian personnel of the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) (1992–1993) arrived in Cambodia together with many [[NGOs]] and business interests from abroad, creating a new market for sexual services in a very poor country. UNTAC did little to stem the growth of prostitution in the country. [[Norodom Sihanouk]] had many reservations about the whole UNTAC operation, for the massive presence of [[UN]] foreign troops led in his eyes to the abuse and dishonor of Cambodian women.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Osborne, ''Sihanouk, Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness.'' Silkworm 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Following UNTAC withdrawal in August 1993, demand was reduced, and a drop in the number of commercial sex establishments and sex workers was apparent. By mid-1994 the numbers started to increase again in a period of political instability. By the mid-1990s police were harassing sex workers, but also owned many of the brothels, which were divided into Vietnamese or [[Khmer people|Khmer]]. Workers between 15 and 18 were not uncommon, but some establishments, such as those in [[Toul Kork]] and [[Svay Pak]], specialised in providing younger workers. NGOs became alarmed by the growth of child prostitution along with number of women and children abducted sold for [[prostitution]]. By 1995 it appeared that women from some surrounding countries were entering Cambodia. International concern was raised and some raids were carried out including one by the [[International Justice Mission]] (2004). This had the effect of displacing the workers.&lt;ref name=ots/&gt;&lt;ref name=hrs&gt;{{Cite journal |title = CAMBODIA: prostitution and sex trafficking: a growing threat to the human rights of women and children in Cambodia | journal = Human Rights Solidarity (vol. 12) | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | date = 4 November 1996 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080918233727/http://www.hrsolidarity.net/mainfile.php/1996vol06no04/219/ | archive-date = 18 September 2008 | url = http://www.hrsolidarity.net/mainfile.php/1996vol06no04/219/ | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[prostitute]]s in Cambodia rose from about 6,000 at the time of the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords]], to over 20,000 after the arrival of UNTAC personnel in 1992, and declined to between 4,000–10,000 following their withdrawal.&lt;ref name=hrs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soizick Crochet, ''Le Cambodge'', Karthala, Paris 1997, {{ISBN|2-86537-722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WyPfynlwMC|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work|website=google.ca|isbn=9780313329708|last1=Ditmore|first1=Melissa Hope|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex tourism ==
[[Cambodia]] has a [[child sex tourism]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The tragic tale of the Cambodian child prostitutes |work= Guardian|date=2000-11-16|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/15/worlddispatch.comment|accessdate=2008-03-01 | location=London | first=John | last=Gittings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Trapping Cambodia's sex tourists |work= BBC|date=2005-06-11|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4078304.stm|accessdate=2008-03-01|first=Andrew|last=Harding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|title= Dateline goes undercover with a human rights group to expose sex trafficking in Cambodia |work= MSNBC|date=|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4038249/|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Far East is perv's Paradise|work= The Sun|date=2007-12-09|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/justice/article563010.ece|accessdate=2008-03-01|location=London|first=Sharon|last=Hendry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cambodia gets tough on child sex trade|work= The Christian Science Monitor|date=|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0927/p06s01-woap.html|accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children are sold by their own parents, others are lured by what they think are legitimate job offers like [[waitress]]ing. Pimps are reported to imprison young children who are virgins, not putting them to work until they have been presented to a series of bidders such as high-ranking military officers, politicians, businessmen and foreign tourists. Young girls working in brothels are in effect sex slaves. They receive no money, only food, and there are armed guards to stop them from running away.&lt;ref name="acr.hrschool.org"&gt;{{cite news |title= Asian Child Rights |work= Asian Human Rights Commission |date=  |url= http://acr.hrschool.org/mainfile.php/0112/61/ |accessdate= 2010-05-18 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100330052508/http://acr.hrschool.org/mainfile.php/0112/61 |archivedate= 2010-03-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often held captive, beaten, and starved to force them into prostitution.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; The [[United States]] [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency]] has extradited American sex tourists back home for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12298870 | work=BBC News | title=The US agents tracking down sex tourists in Cambodia | date=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese child prostitutes make up one third of child prostitutes in Cambodia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanium.org/en/asia-pacific/vietnam/ |title=Children of Viet Nam |last= Busuttil  |first=Fanny |date=15 March 2012 |website=Humanium|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambodian brothels employ girls and women from Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/a/trafficking-of-vietnamese-women-for-wsex-and-marriage-expands-across-region/3335249.html |title=Trafficking of Vietnamese Women Expands Across Region |last= |first= |date=18 May 2016 |newspaper= |location=Bangkok  |publisher=Reuters |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against prostitutes==
Violence against prostitutes, especially [[gang rape]], called ''bauk'' in Cambodian,&lt;ref name="phnompenh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Richard|last2=Sam|first2=Rith|title=Study looks at 'bauk' - gang-rape of prostitutes|url=https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/study-looks-bauk-gang-rape-prostitutes|work=Phnom Penh Post|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=30 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; is common.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aglionby|first1=John|title=Sex workers helpless as young men 'bond' in gang rape outings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/27/cambodia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=26 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators include customers and police officers. According to some sources, such assaults are not condemned by society due to the stigmatization of prostitutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ditmore|first1=Melissa Hope|title="Caught Between the Tiger and the Crocodile": Cambodian Sex Workers' Experiences of Structural and Physical Violence|journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality|volume=15|pages=22–31|doi=10.1080/15240657.2014.877726|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a survey on opinions on ''bauk'' showed that only 13 percent of the males and 13 percent of the females interviewed considered that sex forced by a group of men on a prostitute was [[rape]]. The most common response – 33.4 percent of males and 40.7 percent of females – was that bauk was dangerous because of the potential transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; 12.5 percent of males and 8.1 percent of females said that gang rape against prostitutes didn't hurt anyone because the women were prostitutes and saw many men anyway; while 12.7 percent of males and 16.7 percent of females said it was better that this happened to prostitutes than to other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cambodia.ahrchk.net/mainfile.php/news200304/595/ |title=Gang Rape Has Become the Sport of the Young generation |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302211308/http://cambodia.ahrchk.net/mainfile.php/news200304/595/ |archivedate=2011-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the social stigma cast on prostitutes, paying for sex is very common among men in Cambodia – while Khmer culture demands female virginity, it links masculinity to sexual activity, and as a result, prostitutes are the object of most young men's sexual encounters throughout their youth and early adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-10-26/news/17512745_1_gang-members-cambodia-gang-raping/2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Henry | last=Hoenig | title=France cracking the whip on sex / Liberated nation turns moralistic | date=2003-10-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716044728/http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-10-26/news/17512745_1_gang-members-cambodia-gang-raping/2 | archivedate=2011-07-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence against prostitutes was also described in a 2010 [[Amnesty International]] report, called ''Breaking the Silence – Sexual Violence in Cambodia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa23/001/2010/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Cambodia}}
Cambodia has a high prevalence of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], being one of the worst affected countries in [[Asia]]. By 1995 there were between 50,000 and 90,000 Cambodians affected by AIDS, according to a [[WHO]] estimate. Transmission is mainly through heterosexual contact. Factors contributing to this include poverty, the presence of other [[sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] which facilitate HIV transmission, and a highly mobile workforce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} This pattern is also seen in the sex worker population. Improvement has been seen in the last decade{{When|date=April 2016}} with condom promotion. Since 2001,  there has been a "100% condom program" in place, which promoted safe sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Abstract/2011/01000/Young_Women_Engaged_in_Sex_Work_in_Phnom_Penh,.7.aspx|title=Couture et al.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Cambodia}}

Cambodia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries within the region and increasingly to the [[Middle East]] for work; many are subjected sex trafficking. Migrants using irregular migration channels, predominantly with the assistance of unlicensed brokers, are at an increased risk of trafficking, but those using licensed recruiting agents also become victims of sex trafficking. A significant number of women from rural areas are recruited under false pretences to travel to [[China]] to enter into marriages with Chinese men, who often incur as much as $20,000 in debt to brokers facilitating the transaction; some of these women are then subjected to [[forced prostitution]] as a result of this debt.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambodia 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282626.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Cambodia’s 25 [[Provinces of Cambodia|provinces]] are sources for [[human trafficking]]. Sex trafficking is largely clandestine; Cambodian and ethnic Vietnamese women and girls move from rural areas to cities and tourist destinations, where they are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels and, more frequently, such “indirect” sex establishments as beer gardens, massage parlors, salons, karaoke bars, retail spaces, and non-commercial sites. Cambodian men form the largest source of demand for children exploited in prostitution; however, men from elsewhere in Asia and Europe, the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]] travel to Cambodia to engage in child sex tourism.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

Vietnamese women and children, many of whom are victims of debt bondage, travel to Cambodia and are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report criminal gangs transport some Vietnamese victims through Cambodia before they are exploited in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]]. Traffickers in Cambodia are most commonly family or community members or small networks of independent brokers.  Endemic corruption aids and abets trafficking crimes. Some police reportedly solicit commercial sex with children. Corrupt officials facilitate cross-border trafficking, thwart progress on investigations and prosecutions, and in some cases profit directly from establishments suspected of trafficking.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Cambodia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

'''Scala-Eis-Revue''' was an Ice Show which traveled around [[Europe]] from 1951 until 1968 and after that with Charlie Buchmann as Manager until 1970 (Schneewitchen).

It was owned by Hanns Thelen (who died in 1968) and his son Horst Thelen, who was the technical director of the show. The office and the quarters where in [[Solingen]], [[Germany]]. Also, the technical brains belonged Helmut Eckart who in 1956 left the show to join "Holiday on Ice".  Heinz Klapproth was the administration manager for "Scala" for many years with Georges Sylvestre, Paul Felske and Heinz Koschka as assistance.  Scala Eis-Revue also travelled behind the Iron Curtain, spending several months in the then [[German Democratic Republic]] and [[East Berlin]].

The show included many stars such as [[Ilse Pausin|Ilse]] &amp; Dr. [[Erik Pausin]], [[Sigrid Knaake]] and [[Günther Koch]], [[Kathrin Saller]] and [[Fred Emanuel]], Dr. [[Eva Pawlik]] and Rudi Seeliger, Eva and Horst Faber, [[Majory Chase]], [[Raf Caldicott]] and as Guests [[Marika Kilius]] &amp; [[Hans-Jürgen Bäumler]], [[Inge von der Heiden]], [[Alain Gilletti]], Jack Lee, [[Heinz Kröll]] [[Larry Kemble]], [[Harry Reddy]], Hans Lugmaier, Lucien &amp; Paul Mayer,  [[Paul Carrington (figure skater)|Paul]] &amp; [[Michael Carrington (figure skater)|Michael Carrington]], Jean Rathbone, [[Jaqueline Du Bief|Jaqueline]] and [[Raymonde Du Bief]], and many others. 

The show also travelled and performed for several years in [[France]] with a mobile ice-rink  12 X 18 metre (39 x 59 feet) and a tent for nearly 3,000 people. Also for 6 years, a third show travelled in France with "Circus Pinder" before going for several months to [[South America]].

On its own the show went under the name of "''Feerie de la Glace''" to France from 1952 until 1968 nearly 6 month every year.  There George Sylvestre was the man to organize the tour and Alan Goodman as Technical manager from 1963.

From 1952 until 1964  the show also travelled and performed in [[Italy]] with a second show and material. In 1954 the materials where shipped to [[Istanbul]] in [[Turkey]] for 5 months.

After the return the show went back to France, Germany, the [[Netherlands]]  [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]].  Also [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] were on the agenda.

'''''Street Fighter Alpha 2''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Street Fighter Zero 2'''''|ストリートファイターZERO 2}} in Japan/Asia and South America, is a {{vgy|1996}} [[fighting game]] originally released for the [[CP System II|CPS II]] arcade hardware by [[Capcom]]. The game is both a [[sequel]] and a [[Video game remake|remake]] to the previous year's ''[[Street Fighter Alpha|Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams]]'', which is itself a [[prequel]] to the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' series in terms of plot and setting.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/sfhistory/games_10_02.html |accessdate=February 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702021359/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/sfhistory/games_10_02.html |archivedate=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The game features a number of improvements over the original, such as new attacks, stages, endings, and gameplay features. It was followed by ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' retains most of the new features introduced in the original ''Street Fighter Alpha'', such as the three-level Super Combo gauge, Alpha Counters, Air-Blocking, and Fall Breaking. The main new feature in the game is the inclusion of the Custom Combo system (Original Combo in Japan), which replaces the Chain Combos from the first ''Alpha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Street Fighter Alpha 2: The Latest SF Comes Home to the PlayStation |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Super Combo gauge is on Lv. 1 or above, the player can initiate a Custom Combo pressing two punch buttons and a kick or one punch button and two kicks.&lt;ref name="EGM85"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Street Fighter Alpha 2 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |pages=48-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can then perform any series of basic and special moves to create a Custom Combo until the Timer Gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out. The characters Guy and Gen can still perform Chain Combos, but only to a limited extent. Additionally, each character now has two Alpha Counters instead of just one: one that can be performed with a kick button and another with a punch button.&lt;ref name="SatMag13"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bright|first=Rob |title=Return to Alpha|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]] |issue=13|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1996|page=36-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-player mode, much like the original ''Street Fighter Alpha'', consists of eight matches against computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret "rival" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode. After meeting certain requirements, the rival will interrupt one of the player's matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character, and the player character will then fight the rival instead.&lt;ref name="EGM85"/&gt; With [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed "Shin Akuma" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike ''Super Turbo'' and the original ''Alpha'', Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.

===Characters===
The game brings back all thirteen characters from ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'', with [[M. Bison]], [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]], and [[Dan Hibiki|Dan]] now being immediately selectable as playable characters. In addition to the ''Alpha'' roster, ''Alpha 2'' includes [[Dhalsim]] and [[Zangief]], both from ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', [[Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen]], an assassin from the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'', [[Rolento]], a member of the Mad Gear gang who originally appeared in ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'', and newcomer [[Sakura Kasugano|Sakura]], a Japanese schoolgirl who takes up street fighting after witnessing one of [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]'s battles.&lt;ref name="SatMag12"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Street Fighter Alpha 2|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|pages=16-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
According to Capcom senior planner [[Shinji Mikami]], "When we were trying to get the balance of Alpha 2 right we only concentrated on Alpha 2. That's the one that's important. We don't really have to get the actual same damage as Alpha. In Alpha 2 some new characters were introduced, so in order to maintain the game balance we had to increase the damage for the normal hits. In addition, this time for Alpha 2 we wanted to focus on the importance of the normal hits and not just the specials."&lt;ref name="SatMag12int"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=The Capcom Interview|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' was first unveiled at the February 1996 AOU show in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Model 3: Sega Affirms Arcade Supremacy |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=17|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==

===Arcade===
''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' was released under the title of ''Street Fighter Zero 2'' in Japan, Asia, and South America. The American and European versions of ''Alpha 2'' feature three additional characters who were not in the ''Zero 2'' version: Evil Ryu and the EX versions of Dhalsim and Zangief.&lt;ref name="SatMag12"/&gt; These three characters were selected by Capcom USA.&lt;ref name="SatMag12int"/&gt;

Capcom released an updated version of ''Zero 2'' titled '''''Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha''''', which features all the additional characters from ''Alpha 2'', as well as other changes to the game. In addition to Zangief and Dhalsim, ''Zero 2 Alpha'' also features EX versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat, and M. Bison, all of whom were characters from ''[[Street Fighter II&amp;prime;: Champion Edition]]''. Custom Combos are now executed by pressing a punch and kick button of the same strength simultaneously and now require half (1½ level) of the Super Combo gauge filled to perform them. Some of the characters have gained new moves such as Ryu's ''Shakunetsu Hadouken'' and Dhalsim's Yoga Tempest. ''Zero 2 Alpha'' also features a survival mode, as well as a 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle mode similar to the hidden "Ryu and Ken vs. Bison mode" in the original ''Alpha''. In the Japanese version of ''Zero 2 Alpha'', Evil Ryu has different dialogue exchanges and a different ending from his regular counterpart.

===Ports===
* ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' was ported to the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and the Sega [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] in 1996. The PlayStation port features an arranged soundtrack (in the form of [[CD-ROM|XA-Audio]]), while the Saturn version uses an arranged soundtrack in a streaming ADPCM format (which looped properly like in the arcade version). Both versions feature Shin Akuma as a selectable character via a secret code (which differs between the two versions, the PlayStation version required players to move the cursor in a pattern which formed the letter Z on the character select screen, the Saturn port required a pattern that formed an X), in addition to the classic-style Chun-Li. The Saturn port is the only one of the two versions to feature the characters Evil Ryu, EX Dhalsim, and EX Zangief from the American arcade version. The Saturn port also features an exclusive survival mode, as well as an art gallery.&lt;ref name="SatMag13"/&gt; The PlayStation version of ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' was re-released for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[PlayStation 3]] via the [[PlayStation Network]] on June 4, {{vgy|2009}} in North America.
* The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] version was also released in 1996. Since third-party publishers such as Capcom were increasingly concentrating on CD-based consoles, outside of Japan this version was published by Nintendo instead of Capcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=16-Bit's Final Hurrah|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1996|pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of the [[S-DD1 chip]] for on-the-fly graphic decompression. Despite the graphics decompression chip, this version has loading times when entering matches while sounds are loaded onto the sound chip. Unlike the PlayStation and Saturn versions, the only secret character available to the player through normal means is the classic-style Chun-Li. However, it is possible to unlock Shin Akuma as a playable character by using an [[Action Replay]] code (7E1C2714 for player 1, 7E1C4F14 for player 2). This port was re-released for the Virtual Console in North America on December 7, 2009&lt;ref name="VC NA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/ddQH48likFQNfbvryziHBw2_iPQeYVGA |title=Classic Rayman and Street Fighter Games Lead a Luminous December Lineup |date=7 December 2009 |publisher=Nintendo of America |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the PAL region on January 29, 2010 for the [[Wii]], and in North America on May 22, 2014, and in the PAL region on October 2, 2014 for the [[Wii U]].
* A Windows PC port was also released; based on the PlayStation version (but using the arcade soundtrack in 22&amp;nbsp;kHz WAV format) in 1997. This version was sold as a bundle with the original ''Alpha'' in Japan.
* A home version of ''Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha'' was released under the title of '''''Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold''''' in North America, '''''Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Prime)''''' in Europe, and '''''Street Fighter Zero 2 (Dash)'''''&lt;ref&gt;Like the Japanese versions of ''Street Fighter II Dash'' and ''Street Fighter II Dash Turbo'', the word "Dash" is represented by a [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (’).&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan. The game was released as part of the ''[[Street Fighter Collection]]'', a compilation that also includes ''[[Super Street Fighter II]]'' and ''[[Super Street Fighter II#Super Street Fighter II Turbo|Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]''. ''Alpha 2 Gold'' features most of the same changes, features, and game modes as the arcade version of ''Zero 2 Alpha'', only omitting the 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle mode from the arcade version. In addition to all of the characters featured in previous versions of ''Alpha 2'', ''Gold'' features a version of [[Cammy]] based on her rendition from ''[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]'', who appears as a hidden character selectable only in the game{{'}}s Versus and Training modes. This version was re-released in Japan as a standalone game in the PlayStation the Best and Satakore budget games lines.
* The {{vgy|2006}} [[PlayStation 2]] compilation ''[[Street Fighter Alpha Anthology]]'' features a version of the original ''Alpha 2'' based on the arcade game, as well as a revised version of ''Alpha 2 Gold'' which features Cammy as a selectable character in the game{{'}}s arcade mode (with her own storyline and ending). Both games feature Survival and Dramatic Battle Modes in addition to the Arcade, Versus, and Training modes. The Japanese version of the compilation (''Street Fighter Zero: Fighters' Generation'') features the arcade versions of ''Zero 2'' and ''Zero 2 Alpha'', as well as the US version of ''Alpha 2'' and a revised version of ''Zero 2'' as hidden games.
* A Windows PC port was re-released on GOG.com in 2012.
* ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' was ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo Switch as part of the ''[[Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection]]'' scheduled for May 2018. This version is in arcade perfect form and does not carry the original coding sent to console version ports of the past. Though it comes with save states, ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' (30th Anniversary version) does not include ''Alpha 2 Gold'' as an update.

A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' gave the arcade version 3 out of 5 stars, praising the large number of characters, smooth animation, innovative backgrounds, and "wonderful" character design. He deemed the custom combos "an unprecedented, new, and complex innovation in ''Street Fighter'' gameplay", though he found some points of their implementation to be odd. He concluded, "Although it's just another 2D fighter for those who aren't paying attention, this is a fine new addition for true hard-core gameplayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=2D or Not 2D? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1996|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Japanese arcade magazine ''[[:jp:Gamest|Gamest]]'', ''Street Fighter Zero 2'' was voted [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game of 1996]] in the [[:jp:ゲーメスト大賞|Tenth Annual Grand Prize]]. ''Zero 2'' was also No. 1 in the category of "Best Fighting Game", No. 9 in "Best Graphics", No. 6 in "Best Direction", and No. 4 in "Best VGM (Video Game Music)". [[Dan Hibiki]] and [[Sakura Kasugano]] were depicted on the cover of this issue, who were placed No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the Top 50 Characters of 1996, with [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] at No. 13, [[Zangief]] at No. 18 (sharing the spot with [[List of The King of Fighters characters#Vice &amp; Mature|Mature]] from ''[[The King of Fighters '96]]''), [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]] at No. 26, [[Chun-Li]] at No. 32, [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] at No. 37 (sharing the spot with two other characters), [[Rolento]] at No. 45 (sharing the spot with the Elf from ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara]]'') and [[Ken Masters|Ken]] at No. 49 (sharing the spot with two other characters).&lt;ref name=gamest10th&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ishii |first=Zenji |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1996 |title=第10回ゲーメスト大賞 |journal=Gamest Magazine |volume=188 |issue= |page=pg. 46 |id= |url=http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v188.html |accessdate=2008-12-28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supreme Snowboarding''''' (known as '''''Boarder Zone''''' in the United States),&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; is a snowboarding video game created by [[Housemarque]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolf, Mark J. |author2=Iwatani, Toru |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZb5CAAAQBAJ |title=Video Games Around the World |publisher=MIT Press |website=Google Books |accessdate=1 October 2016|isbn=9780262527163}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first snowboarding games for Windows to take full advantage of 3D graphics cards that were becoming the norm in the late 1990s, and eventually became an internationally bestselling game.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; Over 1.5 million units were sold worldwide, allowing ''Supreme Snowboarding'' to become the first hit title in Finnish game development.&lt;ref name="finland"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kuorikoski, Juho |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1tiCQAAQBAJ |title=Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog |website=Google Books |accessdate=1 October 2016|isbn=9780786499625}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received positive critical reception, as well as acclaim for having one of the best visuals of its time, though its lack of content and replay value was sometimes criticized.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Housemarque's ''Supreme Snowboarding'' was the first Finnish game to be truly successful, and the first to sell over one million units.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; The game's core is built around three major game modes:
*In Arcade, players strive to obtain increasingly large point totals through performing tricks or racing against ghost snowboarders.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;
*The second mode consists of jumping in either a slope or a [[half-pipe]]; with competitors divided into three classes based on performance. Each jump is performed thrice with virtual judges awarding points.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; 
*In the third mode players compete in [[slalom skiing|slalom]] and trick competitions and races.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;
The controls of the game received praise, with players only using three other keys for jumps, tricks and carving snow, along with the directional keys.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; Players hit the jump key to initiate a trick, the trick key is used to perform such tricks, and the third button allows characters to turn faster by carving into the snow.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;

There are nine slalom and six trick courses, as well as six characters, each with their unique pros and cons.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; Each course features four types of weather and is divided into three types: Alpine, Village or Forest.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; There are also four snowboards, each designed to accommodate a different type of snowboarding.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; No internet multiplayer is offered though players can play with up to eight people over a [[LAN]].&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;

== Promotion ==
''Supreme Snowboarding'' was often bundled with other products; for example, players obtained a copy of the game with their [[Kellogg's]] cereal.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; A cut version of the game, titled ''Flo-Boarding'', was packaged into every [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] device in 2003, becoming the first game to be bundled together with the phone.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;

There were initial efforts by [[Sega of America]] to port "high-profile titles" including ''Supreme Snowboarding'' to the [[Dreamcast]] console, though, like many others, such efforts eventually failed due to the platform's uncertain profile with the impending arrival of the [[PlayStation 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pettus, Sam |author2=Munoz, David |author3=Williams, Kevin |author4=Barroso, Ivan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbFxAgAAQBAJ |title=Service Games: The Rise and Fall of SEGA: Enhanced Edition |website=Google Books |accessdate=1 October 2016|isbn=9781311080820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The game initially received critical acclaim upon release in Finland, with its graphics, speed and responsive controls being lauded.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; Reviewers praised the game for its realistic snowy environments and special effects, such as shadowing and weather.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; It was also commended as being easy to control and enjoyable to play, though criticism was leveled at the limited number of tracks and lack of content.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Juho Kuorikoski, in his book ''Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog'', noted in a more contemporary review how despite "''Supreme Snowboarding'' [not being] the young buck it used to be, it still has that addictive element to it. While less impressive on the outside, its inner beauty has remained intact."&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;

In the United States, going on sale under the title ''Boarder Zone'', [[IGN]] rated the game a 8/10, praising the graphics, value for money and "simple fun" of the game, but fault was found with the game's relative lack of content.&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web |author=IGN Staff |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2000/03/11/boarder-zone |title=BOARDER ZONE |publisher=IGN |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was echoed by [[GameSpot]], who praised the graphics and gameplay of ''Boarder Zone'', but also complained about the lack of content and replay value.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web |author=GameSpot Staff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/boarder-zone-review/1900-2538262/ |title=Boarder Zone Review |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Magazine]]'' agreed on all points, noting the "smooth" 3-D engine and realism while criticizing ''Boarder Zone{{'}}''s poor long-term appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Evans, Daniel S. |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,132992,00.asp |title=Boarder Zone |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a technologically advanced game, ''Supreme Snowboarding'' was adopted by hardware manufacturers to showcase the potential of PC processors and graphics cards in 1998 and 1999 at industry events.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

=== Sequel ===
A sequel titled ''[[Transworld Snowboarding (video game)|Transworld Snowboarding]]'' was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console in 2002, noted for being the first ever Finnish-developed console game.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt; It was renamed from ''Supreme Snowboarding 2'' following a licensing shift as the publisher was moved from France to the United States and eventually became a moderate hit.&lt;ref name="finland"/&gt;

'''Swap regret''' is a concept from [[game theory]].  It is a generalization of regret in a repeated, ''n''-decision game.

==Definition==
A player's ''swap-regret'' is defined to be the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{swap-regret}=
\sum_{i=1}^n \max_{j \leq n}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T x^t_i \cdot (p^t_j-p^t_i).&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, it is how much a player could improve by switching each occurrence of decision ''i'' to the best decision ''j'' possible in hindsight.  The swap regret is always nonnegative.

Swap regret is useful for computing [[correlated equilibrium|correlated equilibria]].

'''''The Infidel''''' is a 2010 British [[comedy film]] directed by [[Josh Appignanesi]] and written by [[David Baddiel]]. The film stars [[Omid Djalili]], [[Richard Schiff]], [[Yigal Naor]] and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]]. It revolves around a [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslim]] who goes through an identity crisis when he discovers he was adopted as a child, having been born to a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8114403.stm|title=Omid Djalili becomes an Infidel|publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |accessdate=2009-12-08 |author=Catrin Nye   |date=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Mahmud Nasir is a husband, father and a British Muslim who listens to rock music, particularly the long deceased pop star Gary Page, and occasionally drinks alcohol. His son, Rashid, wishes to marry Uzma, but they need the blessing of her devout Muslim cleric stepfather, Arshad Al-Masri. Mahmud agrees to put on the act of devout Muslim for the occasion. 

Mahmud, while clearing out his recently deceased mother's house, stumbles across an adoption certificate. Mahmud learns he was actually adopted by his Muslim parents when he was two weeks old; his birth parents were Jewish, and his real name is Solomon "Solly" Shimshillewitz. This comes as a shock to Mahmud, who is somewhat anti-Semitic, exemplified by his relationship with his American Jewish neighbour, Leonard "Lenny" Goldberg.

During an argument with Lenny, Mahmud lets slip his ethnicity and his real name, and Lenny mentions a similarity to the name, Isaac "Izzy" Shimshillewitz, a local man, who may be Mahmud's biological father. Mahmud tracks his father to a Jewish old age home. He tries to visit, but a rabbi refuses him entry, saying it would be a shock for Izzy, a Jewish man, to see his son, a Muslim, and advises him to learn to act more like a Jew if he desires to see his father before he dies. 

Lenny agrees to teach Mahmud what he knows about being a Jew, such as dancing like Topol and learning basic Yiddish, but the frequent trips to Lenny's house arouse Mahmud's family's suspicions, especially when Mahmud's [[kippah]] is spotted during a Muslim rally. Mahmud publicly burns the kippah in desperation as a symbol of his supposed hatred of Jews. Mahmud later attends a [[Bar Mitzvah]] with Lenny and unintentionally tells a very crude joke to the audience in broken Yiddish, only to be greeted with laughter from the attendees. Mahmud and Lenny attempt to see Izzy, but the rabbi still refuses to let Mahmud inside when he cannot say his [[Shema Yisrael|Jewish Sh'ma]] or name the [[Five Books of Moses]] in Hebrew.

Mahmud and Lenny have a bitter argument and Mahmud storms off, vowing to tell his family the truth immediately, but when he gets home, he sees that Arshad, Uzma and their friends are already there. Arshad, impressed with Mahmud's supposed devotion to Islam after having seen him burn the kippah on TV, gives his blessing to Rashid and Uzma's union, but the police arrive, along with the media and a crowd of angry Jews and supportive Muslims, to arrest Mahmud for burning the kippah. In desperation, he yells out in front of everyone that he is Jewish, exonerating him of the crime. A disgusted Arshad leaves with Uzma and his friends.

Mahmud's family leaves him for his dishonesty, one of his colleagues at work resigns, and he starts drinking. He becomes suicidal, but is rescued by Lenny, who saw his announcement on the news. Mahmud goes to the old age home and demands to see his father, but learns that his father has already died. Mahmud is allowed inside Izzy's room where he finds a video of his announcement in Izzy's video machine, which Lenny had sent Izzy. Mahmud's only solace is a sticker on the video with the name "Solly" on it, indicating that even after all these years, Izzy still remembered his long-lost son.

Mahmud appears at Arshad's next rally and delivers a speech on behalf of himself, Jewish citizens and Muslims. Mahmud also tells the crowd of another discovery which he's made: Arshad is actually Gary Page, who staged his own death following his fall from fame after a racist remark, resurfacing much later with a whole new identity as a devout Muslim cleric. Arshad escapes from the rally, comically dressed in his old Gary Page clothes. Rashid and Uzma, dressed in Indian clothing, are married in a Bollywood style wedding, attended by both Muslims and Jews. Lenny has taken a job with the mostly-Muslim taxi firm at which Mahmud works.

==Production==
David Baddiel wrote ''The Infidel'' because he has "always been a fan of life-swap comedy (Big, Trading Places, etc)";
he "think[s] that people are terrified about race and religion, especially issues surrounding Muslims and Jews, and when people are terrified, what they really should do is laugh"; and he "love[s] Omid Djalili and his big funny face. [He's] hoping that people recognise that underneath the comedy, the message of the film is one of mutual tolerance: if not, [He's] hoping to find a new identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidelmovie.com/#/filmmakers/david-baddiel/ |title=David Baddiel's profile on The Infidel website |publisher=''[[Slingshot Productions]]'' |accessdate=2009-12-08 |author=David Baddiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The game's premise is that J.J. Macfield, the player character, is searching for her friend and love interest Emily after she goes missing on a camping trip.

==Reception==
''[[Kotaku]]'' highlighted the game for being "transgressive and shockingly frank in talking about [[LGTBQA+]] issues".&lt;ref name="Kotaku 16 October 2018" /&gt; ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' appreciated the game's "surreal mix of coming of age drama and genuinely creepy survival horror", but noted tonal missteps and deficiencies in voice acting and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Game review: The Missing: J.J.

'''''The Virtuous Burglar''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] title: ''Non tutti i ladri vengono per nuocere'')&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-act play by [[Dario Fo]].

==Plot summary==
A [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]-style [[farce]] in which a burglar who is in the act of burgling the house is interrupted by the arrival of a couple - who are in fact having an affair. The farcical complications that ensue also involve the arrival of the burglar's wife. In the end, as they are all arguing among themselves, yet another burglar arrives to burgle the flat.

The play begins with a burglar breaking into a luxury flat. His wife phones him and he is annoyed. As he hangs up, the owner of the house and a woman turn up. The burglar hides inside a grandfather clock but knocks the pendulum, leading the owner and the woman to think that the clock has struck 1:00am. The owner and the woman are having an affair. The owner complains that his wife is so old fashioned and the woman complains that her husband is easily persuaded.

The burglar's wife phones and the owner answers. The burglar's wife thinks she is talking to her husband and that he is having an affair. The owner explains that he isn't her husband and believes that because the husband was watching them, he is a private detective, hired by his wife to see if he was having an affair. This leads the burglar's wife to think that the owner of the house's wife and her husband are having an affair. The owner tells her to phone the house where he thinks his wife is. The woman believes that the 'detective' has phoned the police already and tells the owner to shoot himself. As he is about to pull the trigger, the clock strikes 12:30. This confuses the owner and the woman as they believe the clock is going backwards. The burglar emerges from the clock, having been hit repeatedly by the pendulum. The owner and the woman think they have found the 'detective' and plan to shoot him.

The burglar convinces them not to, but instead, get him drunk. Suddenly, the burglar steals the gun from the owner and threatens him. He reveals he is a burglar. This interests the woman as she has an obsession with "Celebrated Crimes and Thefts." The burglar proves he is a leading member of a notorious gang.

Suddenly, the owner's wife, Anna, turns up. The owner takes the gun and forces the burglar to pretend to be the woman's husband. Anna comes in and tells them she had a telephone call from a woman (the burglar's wife) who said she was having an affair with her husband. The owner introduces the burglar and his "wife" and Anna invites them to stay the night. The spiteful burglar agrees, much to the disdain of the owner and the woman.

The woman and Anna go to sort out a room. The owner forces the burglar at gunpoint to steal, because the burglar said that they exploited burglars. The burglar's real wife turns up and, after a brief conversation, believes that her husband has two wives. Anna appears and the owner poorly explains why the burglar has two wives. The owner spitefully tells the real wife to come and meet the other "wife".

After they have left, a man, Antonio, appears, asking Anna if she is alone. They are having an affair too. Antonio believes Anna set everything up so that she could cancel their date to have an affair with someone else. At this point, the burglar returns to collect his bag. Antonio thinks the burglar and Anna are having an affair and locks them in. Anna explains but Antonio loses the key. Suddenly, the "wives" and owner return. The burglar helps Antonio hide in the clock. The burglar's real wife wants to leave, but there is no key. The burglar picks the lock. As he does so, the clock strikes 1:00am. Antonio emerges, having also been hit by the pendulum. The woman and Antonio are surprised to see each other as they are married.

The burglar attempts to explain things, but the others shut him up so he doesn't reveal the affairs, saying it's all one big misunderstanding. The burglar and his wife escape. The others try and catch them. As they do, another burglar arrives. The others, thinking the first burglar has returned to collect his loot, grab the second burglar. They tell him it's all one big misunderstanding and say they will explain. As they all ramble on with their lies, the second burglar escapes.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UAV Challenge - Outback Rescue''', also known as the '''UAV Outback Challenge''' or '''UAV Challenge''', is an annual competition for the development of unmanned aerial vehicles. The competition was first held in 2007 and features an open challenge for adults, and a high-school challenge. The event is aimed at promoting the civilian use of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s and the development of low-cost systems that could be used for search and rescue missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au|title=UAV Challenge - Outback Rescue|publisher=ARCAA and Government of Queensland|accessdate=2010-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210145124/http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/|archivedate=2012-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is one of the largest [[robotics]] challenges in the world and one of the highest stakes UAV challenges, with the current Medical Express version of the event offering $75,000 to the winner.

The events involve a thorough scoring system with an emphasis on safety, capability and technical excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/2010/UAVChallengeRulesSearchAndRescue2010v1_3.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=UAV Challenge - Outback Rescue Search and Rescue Competition 2010 rules document |publisher=uavoutbackchallenge.com.au |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular there is a strong tendency towards autonomous flight. Notably, teams share technical details of their entries, allowing successful innovations to proliferate and increasing the speed of technological development.

The format of the Challenge changes as technological improvements make the tasks more achievable. In 2011 it changed to a search and rescue challenge. No teams successfully completed the challenge until 2014 when several teams were successful. In 2016 the open challenge changed to an automated medical retrieval task known as Medical Express.

==Challenges==
[[Image:Outback Joe.jpg|thumb|alt=Outback Joe relaxes at the 2010 UAV Challenge|Outback Joe at the ''UAV Outback Challenge''.]]

===Medical Express Challenge===
The Medical Express Challenge is the current event that is open to all. It was first held between 2015 and 2016 with the first event held in Dalby, Queensland, Australia in September 2016. The current Medical Express runs from 2017 to 2018 with the event again being held in Dalby. The challenge itself is for teams to develop a solution to the problem of remote medical retrieval. Teams have to fly their aircraft at least 20km to a remote farm, detect the farmer ''Outback Joe'' and autonomously land close by. The farmer places a medical sample into the aircraft and it must then return to the original launch point which is at least 20km away. The challenge was very nearly completed at the first attempt by a team from Canberra, Australia called Canberra UAV. Their communications relay aircraft crashed at the remote farm site due to an engine failure and the challenge was hence not completed. But their main aircraft did successfully return the medical sample from the farm.

===Search and Rescue Challenge===
The Search and Rescue Challenge was held from 2011 to 2014. It was open to worldwide participation, including by universities and hobbyists. In the challenge, teams must find a target [[mannequin|dummy]], called ''Outback Joe'' and accurately deliver an emergency package to him. The backstory of Joe is that he is a bushwalker that has gotten lost, or a worker who's [[ute (vehicle)|ute]] has broken down. He is represented by a 50&amp;nbsp;kg mannequin dressed in jeans, a work shirt, work boots and an [[Akubra]]. The mission area is nearly {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the airport and is approximately {{convert|4|km|mi}} x {{convert|6|km|mi}}. Teams must not fly greater than 1500&amp;nbsp;ft above ground level (AGL). Under the rules, teams were required to firstly identify the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the target to within 100 meters. Teams that succeeded in this task were permitted to attempt to drop the package and complete the challenge.

Outback Joe was first spotted in 2010 by the University of North Dakota team. In 2012, the Canberra UAV team's aircraft automatically located the target the first fully automatic detection during all events. In 2014, 5 teams correctly identified the target location allowing them to drop a package to him. The winner of the challenge was CanberraUAV, who dropped a water bottle to within 2.6 metres of the target.

===Airborne Delivery Challenge===
The Airborne delivery challenge is open to Australian high school students. The objective is to create a future generation of aerospace professionals with a focus on UAVs.

An airframe has to be built and the mission is executed by two persons who will not communicate during the mission and will have technological targeting solutions in place: 
*''UAV Controller'' in charge of piloting the airframe (or programming the mission in case of the ''Robotic'' challenge)
*''Mission manager'' in charge of the mission package drop
Other team members are permitted and many teams have roles for a team manager, media manager and safety manager.

In 2009 and 2010 a Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge was also held in parallel to the main Airborne Delivery Challenge. The Robot competition was dropped in 2011 in favor of bonus points for autonomous payload dropping in the Airborne Delivery Challenge.

==Rod Walker Trophy==
[[Image:Rodney Walker 2008.jpg|thumb|alt=Rod Walker at the 2008 UAV Challenge|Rod Walker at the ''UAV Outback Challenge 2008''.|right|120px]]
The first place team in the open competition receives the Rod Walker Trophy. The trophy is named in honour of Rodney Walker ([[Queensland University of Technology|QUT]]), who conceived of the idea of the UAV Outback Challenge in 2005 along with Jonathan Roberts and George Curran of [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]].
Rod Walker, a Professor at [[Queensland University of Technology]], died in October 2011, aged 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suasnews.com/2011/10/9129/professor-rodney-walker-co-founder-of-the-outback-challenge-passes-away/ |title= Professor Rodney Walker co founder of The Outback Challenge passes away | publisher = sUAS News |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial fund was set up to support individuals and organisations that try to enhance the use of UAVs for civilian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcaa.net/about-arcaa/rodwalkerfund/ |title= The Rod Walker Memoria Endowment Fund }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kingaroy Triangle==
The term '''The Kingaroy Triangle''' was coined during the second UAV Challenge event in 2008 when it was noticed that aircraft and systems that had worked perfectly well before the UAV Challenge suddenly appeared to have problems at Kingaroy. The term is a reference to the more famous [[Bermuda Triangle]] and also a reference to the general shape of the competition boundary area, which is roughly triangular in nature.

==Annual challenges==

=== 2018 competition ===
2018 marks the return of the Medical Express Challenge for the open teams and the introduction of voluntary dynamic no-fly zones (DNFZ) to the competition. Dynamic no-fly zones represent obstacles that an UAV must avoid during its transit to the search area, which can be birds, bad weather and other aircraft. These obstacles are generated by a computer and passed onto the teams. Due to the complexity of this requirement,only a few teams attempted this aspect of the challenge, with the stand out being Canberra UAV whose avoidance performance impressed the judges. 

The main goal of the competition was to fly to a designated search area and search for a target, onto which the aircraft must land vertically within 10m and retrieve a blood sample from Outback Joe, and return to the base with the sample. The competition was exceptionally close this year, with the top two teams scoring within 1% of one another. The team that has come out on top was Monash UAS, an undergraduate university team from Melbourne, Australia. Although no teams technically completed the challenge due to a variety of reasons, the top three teams were able to return the sample to the base intact. 

=== 2015 competition ===
2015 was a high school-only event with the international Medical Express Challenge starting that year but running for two years (with its own event in Queensland, Australia planned for September 2016). The high-school event was held for the third time at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} west of Ipswich, Queensland).  The event was significant in that major changes to the rules of the Airborne Delivery Challenge meant that the mission task was far more difficult for teams that it had been in previous years. For this competition, teams had to drop a medical payload without breaking it. 2015 also saw the re-introduction of a fully autonomous competition for high-school students, the Robotic Delivery Challenge. Three teams qualified, but none managed to complete the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://soundcloud.com/612abcbrisbane/who-will-save-hapless-outback-joe-in-the-annual-uav-challenge |title=Who will save Hapless Outback Joe in the annual UAV challenge? |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was sponsored by [[Insitu|Insitu Pacific]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Boeing]], [[Defence Science and Technology Group|DSTO]], and LightWare. The Challenge was also supported by the [[Queensland Government]].

=== 2014 competition ===
The 2014 event was held at Kingaroy September 22–26 and followed the same format to the 2012 competition with both a Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenge. For the first time ever, the Search and Rescue mission task was completed and the UAV Challenge Outback Rescue was won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30196627 |title=Can drones get water to stranded Joe in the Outback? |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2014-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four teams completed the mission task with CanberraUAV winning the $50,000 prize on points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gang-gang: Canberra's champion drone|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/ganggang-canberras-champion-drone-20140929-10ncvu.html|accessdate=2014-09-29|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=2014-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also awarded the Rod Walker Trophy for their win. They completed the mission with an autonomous takeoff, a bottle drop accuracy of 2.6m and a fully autonomous landing. One hundred and sixteen Search and Rescue teams registered for the event, with the field of teams being reduced to 20 after the Deliverable 3 qualifying round. Fourteen teams flew at the event and left the airport, beating the previous record of four teams. Four teams successfully completed the task of finding Outback Joe and delivering him at least 500ml of water to within 100m of his location. Team SFWA from Melbourne, Australia, were the first team in the history of the event to complete the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Got it first time: Elusive Outback Joe found|url=http://www.southburnetttimes.com.au/news/got-it-first-time-elusive-outback-joe-found/2401560/|accessdate=2014-09-27|newspaper=South Burnett Times|date=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth team, VAMUdeS from Canada came close to completing the mission with a drop of 116m. The Search and Rescue competition Airmanship Award was sponsored by Insitu Pacific and was awarded to Pawel Wozniak for his outstanding team leadership and decision making.

=== 2013 competition ===
2013 was a high-school only event with the international Search and Rescue Challenge starting that year but running for two years (with its own event at Kingaroy, Queensland, Australia planned for September 2014).
For the second time, the Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field.  The Challenge took place between September 24 and 25. The competition was very close and was notable because for the first time a high-school team (The Hexfactor for Mueller College) managed to achieve a successful autonomous drop of a chocolate bar to Outback Joe, landing within the required 10m distance to be award bonus points. Although the Hexfactor did not win the event, the fact that they succeeded with some autonomy was a milestone for the UAV Challenge.

=== 2012 competition ===
The 2012 event was held at Kingaroy October 1–3 and followed a similar format to the 2010 competition with both a Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenge. The 2012 Search and Rescue competition actually began in 2011 when the competition was lengthened to 18 months in duration. 2012 saw the introduction of the Search Phase as part of the Airborne Delivery Challenge competitions.

Sixty-eight teams registered for the Search and Rescue Challenge, with 53 passing the first checkpoint. Over the subsequent 18 months the field was reduced to just five, the rest having either failed to pass certain milestones or withdrawing due to technical difficulties such as crashes. At the event in Kingaroy, four teams launched their aircraft into the range. The main task was not completed by any of the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/index.cfm?contentID=45 |title= UAV CHALLENGE 2012 RESULTS | publisher = UAV Challenge Website |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two teams did manage to complete a significant portion of their search phase and successfully returned their aircraft to the airport. Team Canberra UAV achieved automatic detection of Outback Joe - the first team to do so in the history of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drone finds dummy 'bushwalker' in world-first|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/drone-finds-dummy-bushwalker-in-worldfirst-20121005-273lv.html|accessdate=2012-10-05|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They did not manage to drop the bottle of water due to an in-flight incident prior to the Outback Joe detection when it appeared that the water bottle became loose from the aircraft and fell off.

Thirteen teams competed in the Airborne Delivery Challenge with a winner declared for its Search Phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/index.cfm?contentID=45 |title= UAV CHALLENGE 2012 RESULTS | publisher = UAV Challenge Website |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Airmanship Award was sponsored by [[Insitu|Insitu Pacific]] and was awarded to Nina Clark for her outstanding team leadership.

=== 2011 competition (new format) ===
On 16 March 2011, the UAV Challenge organizers announced major changes to the format of the Challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suasnews.com/2011/03/4482/new-format-for-international-uav-outback-challenge-to-boost-competition |title= New format for international UAV Outback Challenge to boost competition | publisher = sUAS News |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stated changes included a new longer format Search and Rescue Challenge that results in an event at Kingaroy being held every two years instead of every year (as was done from 2007 to 2010) and the development of Australian State Championships for the Airborne Delivery Challenge. The organizers were quoted as saying that they believe this will lead to "more participants competing with a very high standard of UAV capability".

For the first time, the event was not held at Kingaroy. Instead an Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} west of Ipswich, Queensland) between September 27 and 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/2011/index.cfm?contentID=27 |title= Location Announced for the Airborne Delivery Challenge 2011 | publisher = UAV Challenge Website |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 competition ===
The 2010 UAV Challenge took place between September 27 and 29. In the Search and Rescue competition a team from the University of North Dakota became the first in UAV Challenge history to successfully locate Outback Joe, managing to pinpoint his location to within 15&amp;nbsp;m (from 800&amp;nbsp;ft AGL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topnews.us/content/226982-und-team-ranked-top-uav-competition |title= UND team ranked on top in the UAV competition | publisher = Topnews |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they failed to drop a water bottle within 100&amp;nbsp;m (as required by the rules) and hence did not win the A$50,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/uavs-take-flight-in-queensland-339306320.htm |title= UAVs take flight in Queensland | publisher = ZDNet |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Robota, from Texas, was awarded second place after their aircraft successfully entered the search area but had to abort the mission due to a technical issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/news/uvonline/flying-robots-on-the-up-and-up/7283/ |title= Flying robots on the up and up | publisher = Shephard |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 43 teams entered the Search and Rescue competition with 12 qualifying to fly but only six flying at the event.

===2009 competition===
The 2009 UAV Challenge was announced in the December/January 2008 issue of Aviation Business Asia Pacific magazine. The 2009 event took place between September 28 and October 1. The combined challenge award funds were A$70,000.00. 34 Search and Rescue teams from 5 countries expressed an interest in entering with 12 finally qualifying for the event. In addition to the traditional Search and Rescue Challenge and Airborne Delivery Challenge, there was a new Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge open to high-school students. The two separate documentary challenges of the previous years were combined into a single Documentary Challenge.

2009 was the first year that teams managed to enter the search area. Team Galah suffered an engine shutdown just inside the search area and made an emergency landing less than 100&amp;nbsp;m from Outback Joe (although they were not aware of this at the time). Team Melbourne UAV were en route to the search area when high wind conditions flipped their aircraft causing it to enter flight termination mode. The airframe was lost due to high impact with the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/2836783.htm |title=Unmanned Aerial Vehicles |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 competition===
The 2008 UAV Outback Challenge was held between September 22 and 24 and had a combined prize fund of A$70,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/23/2371486.htm?site=widebay  |title=Pilot-free planes used in mock rescue |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The prize for completing the Search and Rescue Challenge was increased to A$50,000. 51 teams from 8 different countries expressed an interest in entering with 17 finally qualifying for the event. As in 2007, teams failed to complete the Search and Rescue mission, with only Team Telemasters and Missouri S&amp;T UAV teams passing the stringent flight scrutineering to begin the S &amp; R Mission. Missouri S&amp;T crashed on takeoff, and Team Telemasters aborted shortly after takeoff. No flights left the airport for the search area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2603">In [[game theory]] an '''uncorrelated asymmetry''' is an arbitrary asymmetry in a game which is otherwise [[symmetric game|symmetrical]].  The name 'uncorrelated asymmetry' is due to [[John Maynard Smith]] who called payoff relevant asymmetries in games with similar roles for each player 'correlated asymmetries' (note that any game with correlated asymmetries must also have uncorrelated asymmetries).  

The explanation of an uncorrelated asymmetry usually makes reference to "informational asymmetry".  Which may confuse some readers, since, games which may have uncorrelated asymmetries are still games of [[complete information]] .  What differs between the same game with and without an uncorrelated asymmetry is whether the players know which role they have been assigned.  If players in a symmetric game know whether they are Player 1, Player 2, ''etc.'' (or row vs. column player in a [[bimatrix game]]) then an uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  If the players do not know which player they are then no uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  The [[information asymmetry]] is that one player believes he is player 1 and the other believes he is player 2.  Therefore, "informational asymmetry" does not refer to knowledge in the sense of an [[Information set (game theory)|information set]] in an [[extensive form game]].

The concept of uncorrelated asymmetries is important in determining which [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] are [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] in discoordination games such as the [[game of chicken]].  In these games the mixing Nash is the ESS if there is no uncorrelated asymmetry, and the pure conditional Nash equilibria are ESSes when there is an uncorrelated asymmetry.  

The usual applied example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is territory ownership in the [[hawk-dove game]].  Even if the two players ("owner" and "intruder") have the same payoffs (i.e., the game is payoff symmetric), the territory owner will play Hawk, and the intruder Dove, in what is known as the 'Bourgeois strategy' (the reverse is also an ESS known as the 'anti-bourgeois strategy', but makes little biological sense).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6288">'''[[Video gaming]]''' is a growing sector in '''[[Colombia]]'''. The medium has been popular in the country since the [[1980s in video gaming|1980s]], but little local development had taken place until the turn of the 21st century. As the country has been producing a large number of engineers since the early [[2010s in video gaming|2010s]], many of which specialized in electronics, industry and information technology, the local video game industry has been booming.&lt;ref name="Reports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-making-a-splash-in-the-videogames-industry/|publisher=''Colombia Reports''|title=Colombia making a splash in the videogames industry|last=Crisp|first=Johnny|date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Because video games and [[video game console|consoles]] have traditionally been released in Colombia around the same time as they appeared in the [[Video gaming in the United States|United States market]], the history of video game development in Colombia dates back to the late 1980s. Inspired by games such as the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' franchise, young people started programming short game experiences. In the early days of the video game industry in Colombia, large enterprises developed games for foreign studios while smaller, independent companies built games mostly unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Video Games Around the World"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=pZb5CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=video+gaming+in+colombia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HZHoIpfFUU&amp;sig=SOfT8beUVTrPSvkK_hSIcVSxbf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=video%20gaming%20in%20colombia&amp;f=false|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|title=Video Games Around the World|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.P.|last2=Iwatni|first2=Toru|page=137|date=2015-05-15|isbn=0262527162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival [[Loop (festival)|Loop]] was first held in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]]. Now a popular yearly event, the festival organized by Oscar Andrade was one of the first entertainment media events that allowed developers to showcase themselves and their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/tecnologia/festival-de-animacion-y-videojuegos-abre-convocatoria-e-articulo-515558|publisher=''[[El Espectador]]''|title=Festival de animación y videojuegos abre convocatoria para edición 2014|date=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game industry in Colombia received a large boost in [[2009 in video gaming|2009]] due to roundtable discussions by the [[Telecommunications Research Center]]. The company freely exchanged information in order to support the growth of the local ICT industry. Founder of [[Immersion Games]] Ernasto Galvez was chosen as a guest speaker at the first Forum of Digital Content, which opened the door for various small game studios.&lt;ref name="Video Games Around the World" /&gt;

Since 2009, the growth and internationalization of the video game industry in Colombia has been supported by government entity [[Proexport Colombia]]. In January 2012, the sector was added to the country's "Vive Digital Plan," which seeks to improve the country's digital infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Video Games Around the World" /&gt;

Nineteen Colombian video game companies have attended the 2012 [[Game Developers Conference]],&lt;ref name="Reports" /&gt; five of which were able to surprise American journalists and international buyers by showing off an unexpected amount of quality. The companies present at the event came back with various business deals.&lt;ref name="Procolombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procolombia.co/en/news/five-colombian-video-game-developers-surprised-everyone-game-developers-conference-united-state|publisher=''[[ProColombia]]''|title=Five Colombian video-game developers surprised everyone at the Game Developers' Conference in the United States|date=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital-content industry of Colombia, which includes video games as well as other applications, recorded exports of 7 million [[USD]] in 2011 and 19 million USD in 2012. "Entrepreneurial innovation system" Ruta N promotes innovative business based on technology in [[Medellin]], while [[Colombia 3.0]] is a national summit of digital content held yearly in [[Bogota]]. Non-profit organization [[Colombian chapter of the International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA) is a key player, focusing on fostering game-development in the country.&lt;ref name="International Business"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Z0ETBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=vive+digital+plan+colombia+video+games&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bNPRCPMPkO&amp;sig=j5cqBZA-_rTgzK8ffScRbFm0LLE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|title=International Business in Latin America: Innovation, Geography and Internationalization|last1=Newburry|first1=William|last2=Gonzalez-Perez|first2= Maria Alejandra|page=141|date=2015-02-11|isbn=1137409126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[educational video games]] were released in Colombia that were designed to help children learn about a few of the country's many ethnic groups. The video games were released in order to "contribute to the preservation of native culture," as video games are considered "the language children use today."&lt;ref name="WorldNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnewsenespanol.com/309_hispanic-world/3250762_video-games-teach-colombian-children-about-indigenous-cultures.html|publisher=''[[WorldNews]] en Español''|title=Video games teach Colombian children about indigenous cultures|author=Colombian Indians|date=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==

Jairo Nieto of [[Brainz Games]] has stated that the Colombian video game industry started to evolve rapidly when companies such as [[Apple (company)|Apple]] and [[Google]] opened their mobile platforms to independent developers. Furthermore, according to Nieto, "[Government] support is invaluable for the growth of the game industry of Colombia." Though the Colombian government's financial support of the sector has been viewed positively by local gamers, this is mostly because the local government focuses specifically on public relations by creating events and contests.&lt;ref name="Video Games Around the World" /&gt;
