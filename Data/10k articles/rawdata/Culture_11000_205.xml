{{Decadebox|191}}
The '''1910s''' (pronounced "nineteen-tens", also abbreviated as the "teens") was a [[decade]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]] that began on January 1, 1910, and ended on December 31, 1919. The 1910s represented the culmination of [[Europe]]an [[militarism]] which had its beginnings during the second half of the 19th century. The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of [[military alliance]]s, was forever changed by the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]], on June 28, 1914, of [[Archduke]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], the [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[throne]]. The murder triggered a chain of events in which, within 33 days, [[World War I]] broke out in [[Europe]] on August 1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a [[ceasefire|truce]] was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial, one-sided [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed on June 28, 1919.

The war's end triggered the [[abdication]] of various [[monarchy|monarchies]] and the collapse of five of the last modern empires of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], with the latter splintered into &lt;!--May 22, 2009. THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES INTENTIONALLY NOT LINKED; RATHER, PARENTHETICAL "see" at end of paragraph--&gt; Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia. However, each of these states (with the possible exception of Yugoslavia) had large German and Hungarian minorities, creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades.  ''(See [[Austria-Hungary#Successor states|Dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire: Successor States]] for better description of composition of names of successor countries/states following the splinter.)''

The decade was also a period of revolution in a number of countries. The Portuguese [[5 October 1910 revolution]], which ended the 8 century long monarchy, spearheaded the trend, followed by the [[Mexican Revolution]] in November 1910, which led to the ousting of [[dictator]] [[Porfirio Diaz]], developing into a violent [[civil war]] that dragged on until mid-1920, not long after a new [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution]] was signed and ratified. The [[Russian Empire]] also had a similar fate, since its participation on [[World War I]] led it to a social, political and economical collapse which made the [[tsarist autocracy]] unsustainable and, as a following of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|events of 1905]], culminated in the [[Russian Revolution]] and the establishment of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], under the direction of the [[Bolshevik | Bolshevik Party]] later renamed as [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The Russian Revolution of 1917, known as the [[October Revolution]], was followed by the [[Russian Civil War]], which dragged on until approximately late 1922.

Much of the music in these years was [[ballroom]]-themed. Many of the fashionable [[restaurant]]s were equipped with dance floors. [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the United States began January 16, 1919, with the [[ratification]] of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].

'''''A viuvinha''''' ('''''The Little Widow''''') is a novel written by the [[Brazil]]ian writer [[José de Alencar]]. It was first published in 1857. [[Luis de Barros]] adapted it into [[A Viuvinha (film)|a film]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stam and Randall Johnson. "[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC21folder/BrazilStamJohnson.html Beyond Cinema Novo]". ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut'']] 21 (1979): 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story, a young Brazilian man plans to marry a young woman he met in a church. On the day before the wedding, however, he learns that he has squandered his inheritance and let the company he owns go bankrupt. The man follows through with the ceremony, but then fakes suicide and flees to the United States. He lives in the United States for three years, slowly recovering his fortune, then returns to Brazil to reunite with his bride, who has remained faithful to him.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Nazzari.

'''Aitysh Public Fund''' is a charitable organization, which aims to promote and develop culture throughout [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Founded by public figure, producer and director [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] in 2001 in the capital of [[Bishkek]], the structure of the Fund consists of the Union of Improvised Singing ‘Aitysh’, Film Production Company ‘[[Aitysh Film]]’, [[International Film Festival Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films|International Film Festival "Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films"]], [http://manascinema.kg Manas Cinema]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.kg/ru/news/35041/&lt;/ref&gt; network and Literary Organization ‘Kalemger’.

== History ==

The idea of creating Aitysh Public Fund was born in 1998 as at this time the art of traditional improvised singing was poorly developed throughout the country.

In 2001, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] established the Fund to support young singing improvisers and to restore the former greatness of this [[traditional art]] known as ‘Aitysh’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.kg/showwin.php?type=newsportal&amp;id=7914&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.for.kg/news-207706-ru.html&lt;/ref&gt; Together with such well-known singing improvisers as Ashyraly Aytaliev, [[:ru:Турсуналиев,_Эстебес|Estebes Tursunaliev]] and Tuuganbay Abdiev, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] established a school for young singing improvisers. By 2014, the school had approximately 30 students.

In 2003, the singing improvisers were included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]] of Humanity. The Head of [[UNESCO]], [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], gave special thanks to the founder, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]], for his contribution to world culture.

In 2004, the [[NTV (Russia)|Russian NTV]] television channel devoted a programme&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_3pweyKI0&lt;/ref&gt; to Aitysh Public Fund and the art of improvised singing and in 2005, the largest US newspaper ‘[[The Washington Post]]’ published an article&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html&lt;/ref&gt; about this tradition.

The Fund has helped to establish new, talented singing improvisers such as Amantay Kutmanaliev, Jenishbek Toktobek, Elmirbek Imanaliev, Aaly Tutkuchev, Azamat Bolgonbaev. In addition, the Fund has contributed to the resumption of cultural unity between [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] through international competitive concerts.

Later Aitysh Public Fund started to promote the development of other spheres of Kyrgyz culture and from 2004 to launch new cultural projects.

== Activities ==

Since 2001, Aitysh Public Fund has organized and sponsored:

* competitive concerts for singing improvisers 2-3 times per year, with a prize fund of one million Kyrgyz som
* [[charity concert]]s, cultural events and celebrations of the anniversaries of eminent singing improvisers
* [[Film Festivals|film festivals]], film screenings and other events in the field of [[Film|cinema]].

The fund also supports the release, presentation and distribution of publications, video and audio materials, the authors of which include singing improvisers and others.

In 2004, due to the large interest in the art of improvised singing among the population, the first public TV channel [[Kyrgyz Television|Public Television Radio Corporation]] (PTRC) and the second channel ElTR began live broadcasts of the competitive concerts.

Regular partners include the Ministry of Culture of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]], International Humanitarian Cooperation Fund, [[:ru:Платформа_Диалог_Евразия|The Platform ‘Dialogue Eurasia’]], Kyrgyzfilm and [[International PEN Club|International PEN]].

== Projects ==

In 2001, in order to promote the development of the traditional art of improvised singers, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] founded a school for young singing improvisers.

In December 2004, he also founded the literary organization ‘Kalemger’. The purpose of the organization is to support young, talented writers in Kyrgyzstan. Several collections of member’s work have been released, as well as dozens of periodic anthologies.

In 2006, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] founded the film production company ‘[[Aitysh Film]]’. The main objective of the film company is the development of Kyrgyz cinema by supporting the creativity of talented young people. [[Aitysh Film]] produces [[art-house]], [[animation]] and [[Documentary film|documentary]] films.

[[International Film Festival Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films|‘Kyrgyzstan – Land of Short Films’]], an annual International Film Festival for [[short films]] from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], has been held in [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] since 2011. Traditionally, the festival opens on 12 December and lasts 4 days. The opening date of the festival marks the birthday of the famous Kyrgyz author [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], who died in 2008.  Aitmatov was also a [[screenwriter]] and former Head of the Union of Filmmakers of [[Kyrgyzstan]].

== Quotes ==

:A key factor in explaining the sad state of American education can be found in over-bureaucratization, which is seen in the compulsion to consolidate our public schools into massive factories and to increase to mammoth size our universities even in underpopulated states. The problem with bureaucracies is that they have to work hard and long to keep from substituting self-serving survival and growth for their original primary objective. Few succeed. Bureaucracies have no [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], no memory, and no [[conscience]]. If there is a single stumbling block on the road to the future, it is the bureaucracy as we know it. (p. 219)

'''''Bird in Space''''' (''L'Oiseau dans l'espace'') is a series of sculptures by [[Romania]]n sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The original work was created in 1928. It was sold in 2005 for $27.5 million, at the time [[List of most expensive sculptures|a record price]] for a sculpture sold in an auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW-2005-05-10-12-15-39p1.htm Brâncuși's "Bird in Space" Sets World Auction Record for Sculpture at $27,456,000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124121428/http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW-2005-05-10-12-15-39p1.htm |date=January 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crib.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=15441&amp;arhiva=true The price record for a Brâncuși masterpiece was set up in 2005 when “Bird in Space” was sold for USD 27.5 M] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514223741/http://crib.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=15441&amp;arhiva=true |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original title in Romanian is '''''Pasărea în văzduh'''''.

==Description==

In the ''Bird in Space'' works, Brâncuși concentrated not on the physical attributes of the bird, but instead on its movement. The bird's wings and feathers are eliminated, the swell of the body is elongated, and the head and beak are reduced to a slanted oval plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab Met description] of ''Bird in Space'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925072110/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the sculptures in the series are made of [[marble]], while the other nine were cast in [[bronze]]. The first and best known of the series is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], while two bronze casts (1928 and c.1941) reside in that city's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Two versions of the sculpture, one bronze (1924) and one marble (1923–1924), are housed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is home to a marble and a bronze from 1925 and 1927, respectively. A 1926 bronze is held by the [[Seattle Art Museum]] but is currently not on display. Two more bronze casts (1925–1926 and 1927) are on display at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and a 1931 bronze cast is housed at the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]] in Pasadena, California. Another bronze of unknown casting date resides in the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice, Italy, and the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in Canberra owns two marbles, both c.1931-1936, one white and one black.

==Legal Controversy==

In 1926-27, ''Bird in Space'' was the subject of a court battle over its taxation by [[U.S. Customs]]. In October 1926, ''Bird in Space'', along with 19 other Brâncuși sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship ''Paris''.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2002/story_giry_sepoct2002.msp|title=Legal Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731160,00.html|title=Art: Bird|date=31 October 1927|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). [[Marcel Duchamp]] (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer [[Edward Steichen]] (who was to take possession of ''Bird in Space'' after exhibition), and Brâncuși himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the [[Brummer Gallery]] in New York City and then the [[Arts Club of Chicago|Arts Club]] in Chicago.  Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under "Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies") until a decision could be reached. However, customs appraiser F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the ''New York Evening Post'' that "several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government.... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Brâncuși's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Brâncuși left too much to the imagination."&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt; The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision.

Under the 1922 Tariff Act, for a sculpture to count as duty-free it must be an original work of art, with no practical purpose, made by a professional sculptor.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;  No one argued that the piece had a practical purpose, but whether or not the sculpture was art was hotly contested. The 1916 case ''United States v. Olivotti'' had established that sculptures were art only if they were carved or chiseled representations of natural objects "in their true proportions." Therefore, a series of artists and art experts testified for both the defense and the prosecution about the definition of art and who decides exactly what art is.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

Brâncuși's [[affidavit]] to the American Consulate explained the process of creating the piece, establishing its originality:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:I conceived it to be created in bronze and I made a plaster model of it. This I gave to the founder, together with the formula for the bronze alloy and other necessary indications. When the roughcast was delivered to me, I had to stop up the air holes and the core hole, to correct the various defects, and to polish the bronze with files and very fine emery. All this I did myself, by hand; this artistic finishing takes a very long time and is equivalent to beginning the whole work over again. I did not allow anybody else to do any of this finishing work, as the subject of the bronze was my own special creation and nobody but myself could have carried it out to my satisfaction.

Despite the varied opinions on what qualifies as art presented to the court, in November 1928 Judges Young and Waite found in favor of the artist. The decision drafted by Waite concluded:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:The object now under consideration . . . is beautiful and symmetrical in outline, and while some difficulty might be encountered in associating it with a bird, it is nevertheless pleasing to look at and highly ornamental, and as we hold under the evidence that it is the original production of a professional sculptor and is in fact a piece of sculpture and a work of art according to the authorities above referred to, we sustain the protest and find that it is entitled to free entry.

This was the first court decision that accepted that non-representational sculpture could be considered art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/martin/art_law/whatisart.htm|title=Art Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Bird in Space'' was the inspiration for a classical music composition by composer Timothy A. Corpus. This work was premiered at the architectural festival [[Open House Chicago]], in which the piece was performed throughout the festival at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2012/Fall-Culture-Guide-2012-Access-Contemporary-Music-Chicago-Architecture-Foundation-Team-Up/|title=Chicago Architecture Foundation, Classical Composers Team Up for Open House Chicago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American poet, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) refers to Brancusi's "Bird" in her poem, "Reading time: 1 minute 26 seconds" (1939) and uses this link to highlight the fear we have of embracing the new and non-utilitarian in the arts, and to encourage us to break through an unhealthy mind-set so that we may see the world anew: "... The climax when the brain acknowledges the world, / all values extended into the blood awake. / Moment of proof.  And as they say Brancusi did, / building his bird to extend through soaring air, / as Kafka planned stories that draw to eternity / through time extended.  And the climax strikes. ..." (from ''A Turning Wind'', 1939. Muriel Rukeyser).

'''''Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night''''' is an upcoming [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by ArtPlay, DICO and [[WayForward Technologies]], and published by [[505 Games]]. The game is led by former ''[[Castlevania]]'' series producer [[Koji Igarashi]], and is considered a [[spiritual successor]] to the series. ''Bloodstained'' will be released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[Xbox One]]. It is expected to be released in 2019. A retro-style companion game, ''Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon'', was developed by [[Inti Creates]] and released in May 2018.

Igarashi conceived the game after his departure from [[Konami]] in 2014, prompted by numerous fan requests for him to make another [[Metroidvania]]-type game. He used the [[crowdfunding]] platform [[Kickstarter]] to demonstrate to potential funding agencies of the demand for the game in 2015, which successfully raised more than {{USD}}5.5 million from backers, making it the most funded video game crowdfunding campaign on the platform until it was surpassed by ''[[Shenmue III]]'' shortly after.

==Plot==
''Bloodstained'' follows the [[protagonist]] Miriam, an [[orphan]] who was taken in by an [[Alchemist]] guild and subjected to experiments that cause her to crystalize as the result of magi-crystals, crystalized demonic energy, being transplanted into her body. The ordeal placed her in a ten year coma, awakening to find her condition temporarily halted by an alchemist named Johannes who was against the guild's act to summon demons to their world, though his treatment can be averted should Miriam assimilate too many crystal shards from defeated demons.&lt;ref name=ks /&gt;&lt;ref name="characters miriam"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] | first = Koji | last = Igarashi | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | quote = '''Miriam'''&lt;br /&gt;Picked up as an orphan by an Alchemist at a young age, she became a host for the dark Alchemists' curse. Although the magi-crystals were fused with her body at a young age, for 10 years she lay sleeping while the curse matured to its full form. It was during this period that the demons arrived, meaning that she missed their appearance and awoke with a mild form of amnesia, not quite fully understanding what happened to her.&lt;br /&gt;She is a woman of few words but strong of purpose. Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602005746/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 2 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the outbreak of demons and end the curse while retaining her humanity, Miriam ventures into Demon Castle to confront Gebel, another of the alchemists' magi-crystal experiments who lost his humanity and summoned the demons to change the world.&lt;ref name="characters gebel"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] | first = Koji | last = Igarashi | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | quote = '''Gebel'''&lt;br /&gt;Original host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet.

This in turn, led him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;It is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602005746/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 2 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-11-castlevania-director-iga-announces-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Castlevania director Koji Igarashi announces Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150514013936/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-11-castlevania-director-iga-announces-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 14 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="characters johannes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] | first = Koji | last = Igarashi | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | quote = '''Johannes'''&lt;br /&gt;A member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel's best friend.

He has a vague understanding that Miriam's awakening and the demon castle’s appearance are no mere coincidence. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602005746/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 2 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is expected to follow the [[Metroidvania]]-style gameplay of the post-''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia|Order of Ecclesia]]'' games of the ''Castlevania'' series; by defeating enemies, Miriam will gain powers enabled by the crystals on her body, as well as items that can be used to craft new weapons and armor. The game will be presented in a 2.5D style, presenting the game in three-dimensional graphics but restricting movement to a 2D system. Igarashi stated the choice for 2.5D was that it follows in the style of his previous ''Castlevania'' games.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pc gamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/castlevania-producer-koji-igarashi-reveals-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night/|title=Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi reveals Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night|last=Chalk|first=Andy|date=11 May 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513161245/http://www.pcgamer.com/castlevania-producer-koji-igarashi-reveals-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night/|archivedate=13 May 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=11 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bloodstained'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series by [[Konami]], of which [[Koji Igarashi]] had been the series producer from 2001 to 2010. In March 2014, Igarashi opted to leave Konami, stating concern for his continued employment and differences in the directions they wanted to take the company. Igarashi later stated "For the longest time, when I was working at Konami, I was protected by my company. They took care of me. Now I'm kind of anxious."&lt;ref name="polygon day in life"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/5/11/8576141/koji-igarashi-day-in-the-life | title = Koji Igarashi: A Day in the Life | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Matt | last = Leone | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160459/http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/5/11/8576141/koji-igarashi-day-in-the-life | archivedate = 12 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra konami"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/213528/After_leaving_Konami_IGA_takes_a_leap_and_trusts_his_fans.php | title = After leaving Konami, 'IGA' takes a leap and trusts his fans | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Leigh | last = Alexander | date = 19 March 2014 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150513102559/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/213528/After_leaving_Konami_IGA_takes_a_leap_and_trusts_his_fans.php | archivedate = 13 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/17/5514588/koji-igarashi-castlevania-leaves-konami | title = Veteran Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi leaves Konami | first = Michael | last = McWheartor | date = 17 March 2014 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610041630/http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/17/5514588/koji-igarashi-castlevania-leaves-konami | archivedate = 10 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon konami"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5523676/koji-igarashi-interview-castlevania-konami-and-going-independent | title = What's next for Koji Igarashi, the man who left Castlevania and Konami behind | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date = 19 March 2014 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | first = Michael | last = McWheartor | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150426083126/http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5523676/koji-igarashi-interview-castlevania-konami-and-going-independent | archivedate = 26 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Igarashi also stated that he had received a large number of requests from fans to continue to develop ''Castlevania'' games, giving him another reason to leave Konami and aim to start his own studio to develop these fan-requested games, including a [[Metroidvania]]-styled game with similar themes to ''Castlevania''.&lt;ref name="gamasutra konami"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon konami"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anime-expo.org/co-founder-producer-artplay-inc-koji-igarashi-joins-ax-2016/|title=Koji Igarashi, Co-Founder and Producer at ArtPlay, Inc., joins AX 2016! - Anime Expo®|last=LLC|first=DesignFluxx,|date=24 May 2016|work=Anime Expo®|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606024435/http://www.anime-expo.org/co-founder-producer-artplay-inc-koji-igarashi-joins-ax-2016/|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his departure, news of the success of the [[Kickstarter]] for ''[[Mighty No. 9]]'', a ''[[Mega Man]]''-inspired game produced by the former series producer and artist [[Keiji Inafune]], had reached Japan, and inspired Igarashi that this could be a similar route to obtain funding for a new game.&lt;ref name="polygon day in life"/&gt; Following his departure, he began pitching for funding of a new game with the help of Digital Development Management's [[Ben Judd]], who has also assisted with ''Mighty No. 9''{{'}}s funding.&lt;ref name="polygon day in life"/&gt; They approached more than twenty publishers with the pitch, but found that none of them were willing to help. According to Judd, while Igarashi's reputation reduced the risk involved with the title and the projected budget was modest, the publishers were skeptical. Japanese publishers want to make sure that the American and European markets would want the title, and ''Castlevania'' games historically were not as well received in European markets. Western publishers believed the Japanese origins of the games were too strange for them.&lt;ref name="polygon day in life"/&gt; After six months with no success, Igarashi opted to join mobile developer ArtPlay as a paying job, but worked with the company to assure that he would be free to continue to pursue this new game idea.&lt;ref name="polygon day in life"/&gt;

=== Kickstarter ===
Igarashi recognized the success of ''Mighty No. 9''{{'}}s Kickstarter, and began seeking how to do that for his vision. He and Judd were able to locate investors that would help contribute funds, but only if they could show there was a strong interest in the title. The two opted to use Kickstarter to demonstrate what they believed would be a popular title, seeking to gain $500,000 to secure funding that would cover the remaining 10% of development costs.&lt;ref name="gamasutra interview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/243131/QA_Castlevanias_Koji_Igarashi_returns_with_new_game_Bloodstained.php | title = Q&amp;A: Castlevania's Koji Igarashi returns with new game, Bloodstained | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 12 May 2015 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150513111152/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/243131/QA_Castlevanias_Koji_Igarashi_returns_with_new_game_Bloodstained.php | archivedate = 13 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kickstarter was launched on 11 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/11/former-castlevania-producer-announces-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Former Castlevania Producer Announces Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | first = Jose | last = Otero | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | publisher = [[IGN]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171309/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/11/former-castlevania-producer-announces-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 13 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion and handling of the social media for the Kickstarter campaign was handled by [[EarthBound fandom#Fangamer|Fangamer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/bloodstained-kickstarter/|title=Just Kidding: This Game May Break the Kickstarter Record|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=28 May 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529041753/http://www.wired.com/2015/05/bloodstained-kickstarter|archivedate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Kickstarter, Igarashi teased the announcement through social media using the phrases "igavania" and "sword or whip", and on the day of the announcement, participated in live streaming event via [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] playing several other Metroidvania titles with various gaming personalities and developers.&lt;ref name="ks"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | title = Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] | first = Koji | last = Igarashi | date = 11 May 2015 | accessdate = 11 May 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602005746/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night | archivedate = 2 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Player Productions]] helped with filming Igarashi's pitch for the Kickstarter at [[Castello di Amorosa]] in northern California a month prior to its announcement.&lt;ref name="polygon day in life" /&gt;

=== Design ===
Igarashi and ArtPlay are developing the game's narrative, design, and overseeing production, while they have hired DICO as a third-party publisher around June 2016 to assist in developing the game's assets and level design.

Though Igarashi originally anticipated a 2017 release, he announced in September 2016 that he was bringing a second studio to help with the development of the game, and delayed the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-will-now-release-in-2018-385645.phtml|title=Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night will now release in 2018|last=Andriessen|first=CJ|date=8 September 2016|work=[[Destructoid]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909204721/https://www.destructoid.com/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-will-now-release-in-2018-385645.phtml|archivedate=9 September 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=8 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igarashi stated the delay was primarily due to the added work to complete the campaign's stretch goals, a factor he could not consider during the Kickstarter period, and his commitment to making a high quality game, "better than a traditional Iga-vania game that I've made in the past" and not wanting to back down on quality just to make the original release date. The amount of work in man-hours, along with Inti Create's inexperience with the Unreal engine to complete some of the concepts he wanted in the game, led Igarashi to bring in additional studios and push back the release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/why-bloodstained-was-delayed-to-2018|title=Why Bloodstained was Delayed to 2018|date=5 October 2016|work=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006133536/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/why-bloodstained-was-delayed-to-2018|archivedate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igarashi later revealed these studios as DICO, who have experience with localization and global development, and Monobit, for technical assistance with the game engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/11/24/bloodstained-gets-studios-dico-monobit-help-development/|title=Bloodstained Gets Studios DICO And Monobit To Help Out With Its Development|author=Sato|date=24 November 2016|work=[[Siliconera]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125125417/http://www.siliconera.com/2016/11/24/bloodstained-gets-studios-dico-monobit-help-development/|archivedate=25 November 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=24 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is slated for release in 2019.&lt;ref name="novita"/&gt;

In March 2017, Igarashi opted to transfer development from the Wii U to the [[Nintendo Switch]], offering backers who had selected the Wii U version a refund or a choice of the game on a different platform, with the Switch being the default option for backers who had previously chosen the Wii U. Igarashi had started the Kickstarter when the Wii U was the dominant Nintendo platform, but with the introduction of the Switch since that point, he found it difficult to support the Wii U, and made the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/21/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-wii-u-version-canceled-confirmed-for-release-on-nintendo-switch|title=Bloodstained Coming to Nintendo Switch, Canceled on Wii U|last=Campbell|first=Evan|date=21 March 2017|work=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424091907/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/21/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-wii-u-version-canceled-confirmed-for-release-on-nintendo-switch|archivedate=24 April 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=21 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's name is based around the concept of magi-crystal curse that inflicts the main characters: they grow across the person's body with the appearance of stained glass, and Igarashi felt that "Bloodstained" was a good play on words to reflect that.&lt;ref name="gi interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/05/11/koji-igarashi-explains-the-name-of-his-new-game.aspx|title=Castlevania Mastermind Koji Igarashi Spills Details On Bloodstained|last=Reeves|first=Ben|date=11 May 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512155649/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/05/11/koji-igarashi-explains-the-name-of-his-new-game.aspx|archivedate=12 May 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the title is thematically based around the Gothic theme like ''Castlevania'', Igarashi did not want to incorporate the public domain character of [[Dracula]] into it, feeling it would make the game too close to previous ''Castlevania'' titles and did not want to make his new game feel like a "half-baked copy".&lt;ref name="gi interview" /&gt; Igarashi opted to make the main playable character Miriam female based on recognizing current trends in video games in Western markets to present strong female lead characters that the broad range of intended players of either gender would enjoy playing, while avoiding the developmental encumbrances of creating two separate-gendered playable characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/244376/Bloodstaineds_female_lead_Miriam_reflects_the_games_audience.php|title=Bloodstained's female lead, Miriam, reflects the game's audience|last=Nutt|first=Christian|date=26 May 2015|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529091730/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/244376/Bloodstaineds_female_lead_Miriam_reflects_the_games_audience.php|archivedate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=27 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
The development team announced that they would release the game using a staggered content model, following the approach used by ''[[Shovel Knight]]'', so that they are able to release the core game on time, and bring additional content to the game over time and avoid critical release delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/bloodstained-will-take-the-good-shovel-knight-content-delivery-route-not-the-bad-mighty-no-9-one-359774.phtml | title = Bloodstained will take the good Shovel Knight content delivery route, not the bad Mighty No. 9 one | first = Chris | last = Carter | date = 7 May 2016 | accessdate = 7 May 2016 | work = [[Destructoid]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160508093932/http://www.destructoid.com/bloodstained-will-take-the-good-shovel-knight-content-delivery-route-not-the-bad-mighty-no-9-one-359774.phtml | archivedate = 8 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2018, the team announced that the PlayStation Vita version of the game had been cancelled due to Sony dropping support for the system; backers that desired the Vita release were given the option of selecting the game for a different platform for free or assorted refund options.&lt;ref name="novita"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/bloodstained-vita-port-has-been-cancelled-519140.phtml | title = Bloodstained Vita port has been cancelled | first = CJ | last = Andriessen | date = 20 August 2018 | accessdate = 20 August 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant''' is a [[medieval]] [[astrolabe]] believed to date from 1388, and which was found in an [[archaeology|archeological]] dig at the House of Agnes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofagnes.co.uk/history/ The Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant on the House of Agnes website]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bed and breakfast]] hotel in [[Canterbury]], Kent, England in 2005.

The Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant is the only one of its kind known to definitely have been made in England.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/a/canterbury_astrolabe_quadrant.aspx|title=Astrolabe quadrant from Canterbury |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrolabes are calculation instruments that enable their users to tell the time and determine their geographical latitude using the position of the sun and stars.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; An extremely rare instrument, the Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant probably belonged to a travelling scholar who may have lost it in Canterbury while on pilgrimage to that city.

It is also the first astrolabe to have been found during an archaeological dig. Scientific instruments such as this are usually handed down from generation to generation or found among family possessions, but are rarely discovered in the ground.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

The [[British Museum]] was originally outbid in an auction in 2007 for the brass astrolabe, but succeeded in having an export ban imposed on the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2291.aspx|title=Time ticks on rescue of rare 14th century pocket astrolabe quadrant|author= |date=4 December 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of only eight such instruments to have survived from the [[Middle Ages]]. The British Museum eventually purchased it in 2008 with £175,000 from [[The British Museum Friends]] plus grants of £125,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] and £50,000 from [[The Art Fund]].&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2474799/Unique-medieval-astrolabe-saved-by-the-British-Museum.html|title=Unique medieval astrolabe saved by the British Museum |last1=Adams  |first1=Stephen  |date=30 July 2008 |work= |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://search.hlf.org.uk/NHMFWeb/LatestNews/British+Museum+secure+rare+astrolabe+quadrant.htm|title=British Museum second time lucky in securing rare astrolabe quadrant |author= |date=30 July 2008 |work= |publisher=[[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] |accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/a/canterbury_astrolabe_quadrant.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death in the Woods''''' is a 1933 [[short story]] collection by [[Sherwood Anderson]]. It was the last of Anderson's books to be published by [[Boni &amp; Liveright]] before the firm's financial collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1987), 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Dardis (1995), 351-357 for details of the publisher's final days&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stories in the collection were previously published either in magazines ("Why They Got Married" appeared in the March 1929 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'', for example, and "A Meeting South" was first published in ''[[The Dial]]'' of April 1925) and books (versions of "Death in the Woods" and "A Meeting South" were included in ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' and ''Sherwood Anderson's Notebook'' (both 1926), respectively). According to John Earl Bassett, most of the stories in ''Death in the Woods'' were written between 1926 and 1930 with four preceding that time and one following.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett (2005), 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stories==
The collection is made up of 16 stories:
* Death in the Woods
* The Return
* There She Is—She is Taking Her Bath
* The Lost Novel
* The Fight
* Like a Queen
* That Sophistication
* In a Strange Town
* These Mountaineers
* A Sentimental Journey
* A Jury Case
* Another Wife
* A Meeting South
* The Flood
* Why They Got Married
* Brother Death

==Plot of the title story==
"Death in the Woods" is presented as a [[first-person narrative]] by an [[unreliable narrator]], who tells the story of an old woman, Mrs. Grimes. Mrs. Grimes lives on the edge of society and survives by selling eggs and using the proceeds to buy food for herself, her small family and the animals in her care. Her husband is considered to be a horse thief, and the couple is looked down on by others.

Mrs. Grimes' personal history, according to the narrator, is that she was abandoned by her mother and grew up as an [[indentured servant]]. It is suggested that there she received inappropriate attentions from her German master. The master's wife was suspicious and perhaps cruel toward her. Mrs. Grimes agrees to marry Jake Grimes, who "helps" her escape her German master and his wife.

Mrs. Grimes and Jake Grime have a son and a daughter, but the daughter died in childhood. The narrator tells us that their son grows up to be like his father. Both of them verbally abused Mrs. Grimes and treat her in a manner similar to the way the German and his wife had treated her. She does not know life could be any different as this is all she ever experienced, according to the narrator. Her main concern in life is taking care of, and feeding the animals and people in her care. Her duty, she feels, is to feed animal life.

On the last day of her life, Mrs. Grimes walks into town to trade some eggs and buy some meager supplies. Her dogs follow her into town. According to the narrator, the butcher was unusually friendly and compassionate on this visit (because of the snowy, cold weather), giving her some extra liver and speaking to her kindly. She begins her walk home late in the day.

On her way home, she leaves the road and walks through the woods, probably a short cut. On this shortcut she reaches a clearing where she sits down to rest. While sitting down, she dies. The dogs, that had been following her, run around her in circles, then rip the pack away from her and devour the food inside.

The body is discovered by a hunter, who goes into town and tells everyone about the body in the woods. A group of men and some boys, including the narrator, walk into the woods to examine the body and bring it back.

When the narrator and his brother return home, the older brother tells the story. Our narrator set down his version of the story many years later, because he felt that his brother had not been able to properly and efficiently explain the events.

There are other stories that are re-tellings of events or stories told by unreliable narrators- meaning they do not necessary give readers accurate, cold-hard facts. The stories are from their points-of-view, or how they interpret the events or happenings. It is their "working out" of their past experiences.

      <comment>Two wholly subjective sources, one of which being a dogmatic claim from an obscure 1993 lamentation novella, and the other a dubious, pseuodo-prima facie claim from a blog that is no longer being hosted, is not a robust intellectual argument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21021">An '''extended family''' is a family that extends beyond the [[nuclear family]], consisting of parents like father, mother, and their children, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living nearby or in the same household. An example is a married couple that lives with either the husband or the wife's parents. The family changes from immediate household to extended household.

In some circumstances, the extended family comes to live either with or in place of a member of the immediate family. These families include, in one household, near relatives in addition to an immediate family. An example would be an elderly parent who moves in with his or her children due to old age. In modern Western cultures dominated by [[immediate family]] constructs, the term has come to be used generically to refer to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, whether they live together within the same household or not.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L and Taylor, Howard Francis (2007). The extended family may live together for many reasons, such as to help raise children, support for an ill relative, or help with financial problems. Sociology: Understanding a diverse society. p. 396 {{ISBN|0-495-00742-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may also refer to a family unit in which several generations live together within a single household. In some cultures, the term is used synonymously with [[consanguineous family]].

In a stem family, a type of extended family, first presented by [[Frédéric Le Play]], parents will live with one child and his or her spouse, as well as the children of both, while other children will leave the house or remain in it unmarried. The stem family is sometimes associated with inegalitarian inheritance practices, as in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], but the term has also been used in some contexts to describe a family type where parents live with a married child and his or her spouse and children, but the transfer of land and moveable property is more or less egalitarian, as in the case of traditional [[Romania]],&lt;ref&gt;Gender and Well-Being  Interactions between Work, Family and Public Policies  COST ACTION A 34  Second Symposium:  The Transmission of Well-Being: Marriage Strategies  and Inheritance Systems in Europe (17th-20th Centuries)  25th -28th April 2007  University of Minho  Guimarães-Portugal http://www.ub.edu/tig/GWBNet/MinhoPapers/Constanta%20Ghitulescu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; northeastern [[Thailand]]&lt;ref name="KertzerFricke1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David I.

In an extended family, parents and their children's families may often live under a single roof. This type of '''joint family''' often includes multiple generations in the family. From culture to culture, the variance of the term may have different meanings. For instance, in [[India]], the family is a [[patriarchal]] society, with the sons' families often staying in the same house.

In the joint family, the workload is shared among the members. The patriarch of the family (often the oldest male member) is the head of the household. Grandparents are usually involved in the raising process of the children along with guidance and education.  Like any family unit the success and structure are dependent on the personalities of the individuals involved.

Amy Goyer, [[AARP]] multigenerational issues expert, said the most common multigenerational household is one with a grandparent as head of household and his adult children having moved in with their children, an arrangement usually spurred by the needs of one or both to combine resources and save money. The second most popular is a grandparent moving in with an adult child's family, usually for care-giving reasons. She noted that 2.5&amp;nbsp;million grandparents say they are responsible for the basic needs of the grandchild living with them.&lt;ref&gt;Bulik, B. (2010). We Are Family-And More Of Us Are Living Under One Roof. (Cover story). Advertising Age, 81(30), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Are the statements in this paragraph referring to the United States? If so, this has to be explicitly stated.|date=May 2014}}

The house often has a large reception area and a common kitchen. Each family has their own bedroom.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The members of the household also look after each other when a member  is ill.

==Sociology==
It has often been presumed that extended family groups sharing a single household enjoy certain advantages, such as a greater sense of security and belonging due to sharing a wider pool of members to serve as resources during a crisis, and more role models to help perpetuate desired behavior and cultural values. However, even in cultures in which adults are expected to leave home after marriage to begin their own nuclear-based households, the extended family often forms an important support network offering similar advantages. Particularly in working-class communities, grown children tend to establish their own households within the same general area as their parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. These extended family members tend to gather often for family events and to feel responsible for helping and supporting one another, both emotionally and financially.&lt;ref name="Browne, Ken 2011 p. 107"&gt;Browne, Ken (2011). Introduction to Sociology. p. 107 {{ISBN|0-7456-5008-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While contemporary families may be considered more mobile in general than in the past, sociologists find that this has not necessarily resulted in the disintegration of extended family networks. Rather, technological aids such as the Internet and [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] such as [[Facebook]] are now commonly used{{where?|date=May 2014}} to retain contact and maintain these family ties.&lt;ref name="Browne, Ken 2011 p. 107"/&gt;

Particularly in the case of single-parent households, it can be helpful for extended family members to share a single household in order to share the burden of meeting expenses. On the other hand, sharing a household can present a disadvantage depending on the sizes and number of families involved, particularly when only a few members shoulder most of the responsibility to meet expenses for the family's basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;Pillitteri, Adele (2009).

An estimated 49&amp;nbsp;million Americans (16.1% of the total population) live in homes comprising three or more generations, up from 42&amp;nbsp;million in 2000. This situation is similar in Western Europe. Another 34 percent live within a kilometer of their children.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/03/18/the-return-of-the-multi-generational-family-household/|title=The Return of the Multi-Generational Family Household &amp;#124; Pew Research Center’s Social &amp;amp; Demographic Trends Project|publisher=pewsocialtrends.org|date=2010-03-18|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is also said that in an extended family grandfathers and grandmothers take care of the children staying home,mother works in the kitchen and father does the financial work&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==

In many cultures, such as in those of many of the [[Asians]], [[Middle Easterners]], [[Africans]], [[Eastern Europeans]], [[Southern Europe]], indigenous [[Latin Americans]] and [[Pacific Islanders]], ''extended families'' are the basic family unit. Even in Western [[Europe]], extended families (mostly of the stem type) were also clearly prevalent, [[England]] being a rare exception.&lt;ref&gt;Family Types and the Persistence of Regional Disparities in Europe http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/33152/1/sercdp0009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who|date=May 2014}} have stated that the relative "uniqueness" of the traditional English family (the absolute nuclear family) was at least partly responsible for the birth of [[industrialization]], [[free-market capitalism]] and [[liberalism]] in that country.

It is common for today's world to have older children in nuclear families to reach walking up to driving age ranges before meeting extended family members. Geographical isolation is common for middle-class families who move based on occupational opportunities while family branches "retain [their] basic independence".&lt;ref&gt;Meyerhoff, Michael. Discovery Fit and Health. ''Understanding Family Structure and Dynamics: The Extended Family''. Discovery Communications, LLC. 2012. Web. [http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/parenting/understanding-family-structures-and-dynamics-ga2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Some extended families hold family reunions or opportunities for gathering regularly, normally around holiday time frames, to reestablish and integrate a stronger family connection. This allows individual nuclear families to connect with extended family members.

[[Australian Aborigines]] are another group for whom the concept of family extends well beyond the nuclear model. Aboriginal immediate families include aunts, uncles and a number of other relatives who would be considered "distant relations" in the context of the nuclear family. Aboriginal families have strict social rules regarding whom they can marry. Their family structure incorporates a shared responsibility for all tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Where families consist of multiple generations living together, the family is usually headed by the oldest man. More often than not, it consists of grandparents, their sons and their sons' families. Extended families make discussions together and solve a problem.

===South Asia===
{{main|Hindu joint family}}
Historically, for generations [[South Asia]] had a prevailing tradition of the ''joint family system'' or ''undivided family''. Joint family system is an extended family arrangement prevalent throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]], particularly in [[India]], consisting of many generations living in the same home, all bound by the common relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talwar|first1=Swati|title=Meaning of HUF (Hindu Undivided Family)|url=http://taxpaisa.com/meaning-huf-hindu-undivided-family/|publisher=Taxpaisa.com|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patrilineal joint family consists of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons’ wives and children. The family is headed by a patriarch, usually the oldest male, who makes decisions on economic and social matters on behalf of the entire family. The patriarch's wife generally exerts control over the household, minor religious practices and often wields considerable influence in domestic matters. Family income flows into a common pool, from which resources are drawn to meet the needs of all members, which are regulated by the heads of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Hindu Joint Family: The Norms and the Numbers |author=Henry Orenstein and Michael Micklin|journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=39 |issue=3/4 |quote=Autumn, 1966 |jstor=2754275 |pages=314–325 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent trend in the United States===
{{See also|American family structure}}
In the early stages of the twentieth century, it was not very common to find many families with extended kin in their household, which may have been due to the idea that the young people in these times typically waited to establish themselves and start a household before they married and filled a home.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} As life expectancy becomes older and programs such as Social Security benefit the elderly, the old are now beginning to live longer than prior generations, which then may lead to generations mixing together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew J.|title=Public and Private families|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to results of a study by [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;million (nearly one in six) Americans, including rising numbers of seniors, live in households with at least two adult generations, and often three. It has become an ongoing trend for elderly generations to move in and live with their children, as they can give them support and help with everyday living. The main reasons cited for this shift are an increase in unemployment and slumped housing prices and arrival of new immigrants from Asian and South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-best-life/2010/03/21/surge-in-multigenerational-households-.html Surge in Multigenerational Households], ''U.S. News'' (March 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the number of U.S. "family groups" where one or more subfamilies live in a household (e.g. a householder's daughter has a child. The mother-child is a subfamily) was 79&amp;nbsp;million. Two-point-six million of U.S. multigenerational family households in 2000 had a householder, the householder's children, and the householder's grandchildren. That's 65 percent of multigenerational family households in the U.S. So it is twice as common for a grandparent to be the householder than for adult children to bring parents into their home.&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, Po. Multiple Generation/Extended Family Households. ''The Factbook: eye-opening memos on everything family.'' 2000 [http://www.pobronson.com/factbook/pages/41.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the number of multigenerational households has created complex legal issues, such as who in the household has authority to consent to police searches of the family home or private bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1532243 When is a Parent's Authority Apparent?

===Mexico===
Mexican society is composed of three-generational units consisting of grandparents, children and grandchildren. Further close relationships are maintained with the [[progenitor]]s of these families and are known as kin or "cousins" When one is born they are born into two extended families, a kinship group of sometimes 70 people. The group traditionally acts as a cohesive unit pooling resources and influence. The extended family also consists of spouses and siblings. This is in contrast to the two generational American nuclear family.&lt;ref&gt;The Family on the Threshold of the 21st Century: Trends and Implications  By Solly Dreman&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have used the term "grand-family" to describe the close relationship between grandparents, children, and grandchildren in Mexican society.&lt;ref name = Lomnitz&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lomnitz |first1=Larissa A. |last2=Perez-Lizaur |first2=Marisol |year= 2003|chapter=Dynastic Growth and Survival Strategies: The Solidarity of Mexican Grand Families |editor1-last=Cheal |editor1-first=David |title=Family: Critical Concepts in Sociology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H86sRSfV6oMC&amp;pg=PA377 |publisher=Psychology Press |publication-date=2003 |page=377 |isbn=0415226325 |access-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelin |first=Elizabeth |date=1991 |title=Family, Household and Gender Relations in Latin America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEOaAAAAIAAJ |publisher=Kegan Paul International |page= |isbn=9231026577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larissa A. Lomnitz and Marisol Perez-Lizaur, for example, describe the grand-family as "the basic unit of family solidarity in Mexico", where basic family obligations between grandparents, children, and grandchildren include "economic support, participation in family rituals, and social recognition".&lt;ref name = Lomnitz/&gt; Katie Willis and Cathy Mcilwaine also note that grand-families are a "distinctive feature" of "low-income", "middle-income", as well as "elite sectors" of Mexican society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Katie |last2=Mcilwaine |first2=Cathy |date=2014 |title=Challenges and Change in Middle America: Perspectives on Development in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUGgBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1317876881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic background===
{{Globalize|date=April 2018}}
Economic background has become a very prominent factor in the likelihood of living in an extended family. Many families{{Where?|date=May 2014}} who live in low-income areas are beginning{{When|date=May 2014}} to move in with one another for financial and emotional support. The relative economic deprivation of racial and ethnic minorities leads to higher levels of extended family involvement; primarily because blacks and Latinos have less money and education than whites, they are more likely to give and receive help from kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerstel | first1 = N | year = 2011 | title = Rethinking Families and Community: The Color, Class, and Centrality of Extended Kin Ties | url = | journal = Sociological Forum | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01222.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having family on which one can rely is very important in times of economic hardship especially if there are children involved. Living in an extended family provides constant care for children and support for other members of the family as well. Analysis of the National Survey of Families and Households{{Clarify|date=May 2014|reason=Whose nation's 'National Survey'?}} suggests there are differences between whites and other ethnic groups because of economic differences among racial groups: blacks and Latinos less often have the economic resources that allow the kind of privatization that the nuclear family entails. Extended kinship, then, is a survival strategy in the face of economic difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstel, N. (2011). Rethinking Families and Community: The Color, Class, and Centrality of Extended Kin Ties. ''Sociological Forum'', 26(1), 1-20. doi:10.1111/ j.1573-7861.2010.01222.x&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to rely on not only two parents but grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters helps to create a support system which in turn brings families closer together. Living in an extended family provides many things that a nuclear family does not.

The number of multigenerational households has been steadily rising because of the economic hardships people are experiencing today.{{When|date=May 2014}} According to the AARP, multigenerational households have increased from 5&amp;nbsp;million in 2000 to 6.2&amp;nbsp;million in 2008.&lt;ref name="Metcalf, E. R. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Metcalf | first1 = E. R. | year = 2010 | title = The Family That Stays Together | url = | journal = Saturday Evening Post | volume = 282 | issue = 1| page = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"There's no question that with some ethnicities that are growing in America, it is more mainstream and traditional to have multigenerational households. We're going to see that increasing in the general population as well," says AARP's Ginzler.&lt;ref name="Metcalf, E. R. 2010"/&gt; While high unemployment and housing foreclosures of the recession have played a key role in the trend, Pew Research Center exec VP and co-author of its multigenerational household study Paul Taylor said it has been growing over several decades, fueled by demographic and cultural shifts such as the rising number of immigrants and the rising average age of young-adult marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bulik | first1 = B | year = 2010 | title = We Are Family-And More Of Us Are Living Under One Roof. (Cover story) | url = | journal = Advertising Age | volume = 81 | issue = 30| pages = 1–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of an extended family is one that many people may not realize, but having a support system and many forms of income may help people today because of the difficulties in finding a job and bringing in enough money.{{clarify|reason=Are the statements in this paragraph or in fact the whole section referring to the United States?

==Complex family==
"Complex family" is a generic term for any family structure involving more than two adults. The term can refer to any extended family, [[polyamory|polyamorous]] or to a [[polygamy]] of any type. It is often used to refer to the [[group marriage]] form of polygamy.

[[File:Judy Garland-publicity.JPG|thumb|Actress and singer [[Judy Garland]] is cited as one of the quintessential gay icons.]]
A '''gay icon''' is a [[public figure]] (historical or present) who is embraced by many within [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) communities.

Some of the main qualities of a gay icon often include [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]], [[wikt:flamboyant|flamboyance]], strength through adversity, and [[androgyny]] in presentation. Such icons can be of any [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender]]; if LGBT, they can be [[Coming out|out]] or not. Although most gay icons have given their support to [[LGBT social movements]], some have expressed [[LGBT rights opposition|opposition]], advocating against a perceived "[[homosexual agenda]]".

Historically, icons were typically elevated to such status because their sexual orientation remains a topic of debate among historians. Modern gay icons are predominantly female entertainers who commonly garner a large following within LGBT communities over the course of their careers.

[[File:Sodoma 003.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Sebastian]], history's first recorded gay icon]]

Due to Saint Sebastian's status as a gay icon, [[Tennessee Williams]] chose to use the saint's name for the martyred character Sebastian in his play, ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''.&lt;ref name=tnwilliams&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityrep.com/DownloadDocs/Suddenly_Last_Summer_SG.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tiny Rep presents ''Suddenly, Last Summer'' |accessdate=August 1, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002111/http://www.trinityrep.com/DownloadDocs/Suddenly_Last_Summer_SG.pdf |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also used by [[Oscar Wilde]]—as Sebastian Melmoth—when in exile after his release from prison. Wilde, an Irish writer and poet, was about as "[[out of the closet]]" as was possible for the late 19th century, and is himself considered to be a gay icon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/europe/article1289533.ece Vatican comes out of the closet and embraces Oscar]; Richard Owen, [[The Times]]; January 5, 2007. Retrieved October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Antoinette]] was an early lesbian icon. Rumors about her relationships with women circulated in pornographic detail by anti-royalist pamphlets before the [[French Revolution]]. In [[Victorian era|Victorian England]], biographers who idealized the [[Ancien Régime]] made a point of denying the rumours, but at the same time romanticised Marie Antoinette's "sisterly" friendship with the [[Princesse de Lamballe]] as—in the words of an 1858 biography—one of the "rare and great loves that Providence unites in death."&lt;ref name="afraser" /&gt; By the end of the 19th century, she was a cult icon of "[[Terminology of homosexuality#Sapphism|sapphism]]." Her execution, seen as tragic martyrdom, may have added to her appeal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Allusions to her appearance were made in early 20th century [[lesbian literature]]—most notably [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''—where the gay playwright Jonathan Brockett describes Marie Antoinette and de Lamballe as "poor souls... sick to death of the subterfuge and pretenses."&lt;ref name="Castle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Castle |first=Terry |title=The Apparitional Lesbian: Female Homosexuality and Modern Culture |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1993 |location=New York |pages=126–149 and 261n56 |isbn=0-231-07652-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had crossover appeal as a gay icon, as well, at least for French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist [[Jean Genet]], who was fascinated by her story. He included a reenactment of her execution in his 1947 play ''[[The Maids]]''.&lt;ref name=afraser&gt;{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=Antonia |authorlink=Antonia Fraser |title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey |publisher=Anchor |year=2001 |location=New York |page=449 |isbn=0-385-48949-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
[[File:Marlon Brando 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bisexual icon [[Marlon Brando]]]]
Modern gay icons in entertainment include film stars and musicians, most of whom have strong, distinctive personalities, and many of whom died young or under tragic circumstances. For example, Greek-American opera singer [[Maria Callas]]—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after her voice had deserted her.

Lesbian icons, sometimes called "dykons" (a [[portmanteau]] of the words "dyke" and "icon") are most often powerful women who are, or are rumored to be, lesbian or bisexual.&lt;ref name=Dykon&gt;Euan Ferguson, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/feb/16/features.review147 Daniela's still dying for it]; February 16, 2003; Retrieved February 8, 2007: ''All over the South-East men fell in lust with the idea of a fast lippy sexy Scot, and I'm told she also became something of a dykon, a female gay icon.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="POP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/gay-icons-judy-who/ |title=Queer, Isn't It?: Gay Icons: Judy Who? |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |first=Michael |last=Abernethy |work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few male entertainers have also had iconic status for lesbian people.

He also wrote lesbian-themed fiction under the pseudonym Laurajean Ermayne.

Gay icons may be homosexual or heterosexual, out or [[Coming out|in the closet]], male or female. The women most commonly portrayed by [[drag queen]]s are usually gay icons. The definition of what it means to be a "gay icon" has come under criticism in recent years for a lack of substance. [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "The concept of gay icon is a cheap ticket...[and] the idea of gay iconography itself is currently replaceable with the idea of popularity and the ability to carry a strong, identifiable, [[trademark look|signature look]]."&lt;ref name=EYE&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/16/bypaulflynn |title=Margaret Thatcher: gay icon |last=Flynn |first=Paul |work=The Guardian |location=London|date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Michael Thomas Ford]] depicts a similar attitude in his work of fiction ''Last Summer''.

===Non-American cultures===
Although the term "gay icon" is most commonly used in the United States, the concept is found in other cultures, as well. [[Dalida]], an Egyptian singer of Italian origin, had a career-long gay following that extended out of Paris and well into the Middle East. In the years since her death, her iconic status has not diminished.&lt;ref name=dalida&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Private-Gay-Paris-Walking-Tour-Pere-Lachaise-Cemetery-and-Montmartre/d479-3061MON |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117165709/http://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Private-Gay-Paris-Walking-Tour-Pere-Lachaise-Cemetery-and-Montmartre/d479-3061MON |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |title=Gay Montmartre Tour |accessdate=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dalida2&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=France |url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5304 |title=Dying to come out:The war on gay people in Iraq |work=[[GQ magazine]] |date=February 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513201216/http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5304 |archivedate=May 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of their pro-LGBT activism and their artistry, Taiwanese singers [[A-mei]] and [[Jolin Tsai]], Indian actor [[Anil Kapoor]] and Indian actress [[Sonam Kapoor]] and Hong Kong singer, [[Leslie Cheung]] have been called gay icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/heres-how-anil-kapoor-became-the-newest-gay-icon/ |title=Here’s how Anil Kapoor became the newest gay icon! |publisher=Bollywoodlife.com |date=2015-09-08 |accessdate=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-is-sonam-kapoor-indias-new-gay-icon/20110627.htm |title=Is Sonam Kapoor India's new gay icon? - Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ho |first=Gwyneth |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43637749 |title=Leslie Cheung: Asia's gay icon lives on 15 years after his death - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European====
Similarly, in European countries such as the [[Netherlands]], Dutch singer and actress [[Willeke Alberti]] is widely embraced as a gay icon, due to a combination of her song repertoire, her durability, and her performances in support of manifold gay causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gayinfo.tripod.com/WOF.html |title=Foot and Hand Prints in Rotterdam |publisher=Gayinfo.tripod.com |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish actress [[Carmen Maura]], Spanish politician [[Pedro Zerolo]],&lt;ref name="cascaraamarga.es"&gt;[http://www.cascaraamarga.es/sociedad/gente/11569-fallece-pedro-zerolo-un-icono-del-activismo-lgtb.html «Fallece Pedro Zerolo, un icono del activismo LGTB.»]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian singer [[Mina Mazzini|Mina]], and [[Raffaella Carrà]], Scottish pop singer [[Jimmy Somerville]], German actress and singer [[Hildegard Knef]] and English singers [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] are also considered gay icons,&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (August 13, 2006).

====Latin America====
Latin American figures have also gained reputations as gay icons. Pop band [[Alaska y Dinarama]] is one example. Their single "[[¿A quién le importa?]]" ("Who Cares?"), which was later covered in 2002 by [[Thalía]], was a hit for the 1980s Spanish band, becoming a [[gay anthem]] for the [[Hispanophone]] LGBT community. Singer [[Gloria Trevi]] is considered a gay icon, especially after her release of "[[Todos Me Miran]]" ("They All Are Looking at Me") featuring a rejected gay man turned drag queen, but had been popular with the gay and lesbian community in Mexico since the beginning of her career for being a controversial and powerful singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An anti-diva returns to thank her fans |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/entertainment/5438315.html |work=Houston Chronicle |date=January 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican singer and actress [[Paulina Rubio]] has been a gay icon for Latin America after supporting gay marriage and publicly stating that she wants to have sex with fellow gay icon [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez |first=Lisa |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613712/20090610/story.jhtml |title=Paulina Rubio Inspired By Miami For New Album And Video |work=Mtv |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====

=====1930s–1940s=====
The 1930s saw a number of writers, political activists, and celebrities garner reputations as gay icons. Poet and satirical writer [[Dorothy Parker]] reportedly had a large gay following. Though the phrase "[[friend of Dorothy]]" was made popular in later years by Judy Garland's role in ''The Wizard Of Oz'' (1939), some{{who|date=January 2017}} speculate it originated with Parker.

Actress [[Bette Davis]]' performance in ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (1939), was dubbed by [[Queer theory|queer theorist]] Eve Sedgwick as "the epistemology of [[the closet]]."&lt;ref name="Dark Victory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikov |first=Ed |title=Dark Victory: The Life of Bette Davis |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=W7qpYrkAXw8C|isbn=0-8050-7548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis' portrayal of the melodramatic [[Judith Traherne]] made her talent for playing someone with a secret revered and her "camp-worthy" dialog reflexive of the "flamboyant gay queen of the dramatic arts."&lt;ref name="Dark Victory" /&gt; Ed Sikov, author of ''Dark Victory: The Life of Bette Davis'', wrote that 20th century gay men developed their own subculture following Davis' example.&lt;ref name="Dark Victory" /&gt;

In [[Marcella Althaus-Reid]]'s ''Liberation Theology and Sexuality'', [[Marlene Dietrich]], who is considered to be the first German-born actress to receive critical acclaim in Hollywood, is a model of liberation and subversion, as well as beauty, perfection and sensuality.&lt;ref name=dietrich&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/12/25/marlene.dietrich/index.html |title=Review: 'Dietrich' beautiful photo collection |last=Dunn |first=Andrew |work=[[CNN]].com |date=December 25, 2001 |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016163924/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/books/12/25/marlene.dietrich/index.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dietrich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Althaus-Reid |first=Marcella |title=Liberation Theology and Sexuality |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2006 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LD5nkd_1iKcC|isbn=0-7546-5080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rio de Janeiro]], Althaus-Reid discovered a statue of Dietrich dressed as [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in a gay bar in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] beach.&lt;ref name="Dietrich" /&gt; The image of Dietrich as the [[Black Madonna|black Virgin Mary]] represents her overcoming duality.&lt;ref name="Dietrich" /&gt; According to Althaus-Reid, it is a figure that sanctifies Dietrich while simultaneously liberating Mary.&lt;ref name="Dietrich" /&gt;

Other icons from this time period include [[Cary Grant]], who endured speculation over his alleged relationships with men.

=====1950s–1960s=====

The expression "Is he a [[friend of Dorothy]]?" was slang for "Is he gay?"&lt;ref name="Gayle" /&gt; The character Dorothy meets an odd group of friends during her journey through Oz—the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow—and so referring to an individual as a "friend of Dorothy" meant that they were "unusual or odd" and, therefore, "queer".&lt;ref name="Gayle" /&gt; Though Garland has been noted for her embodiment of [[camp (style)|camp]] in her acting roles, Bronski argues that she was the "antithesis of camp" and "made a legend of her pain and oppression."&lt;ref name="Culture Clash" /&gt; As Bronski observes, the bleak setting of 1950s Hollywood had replaced the "sauciness of the [1930s] and the independence of the [1940s]."&lt;ref name="Culture Clash" /&gt; Garland, as well as [[Connie Francis]], [[Lana Turner]] and [[Susan Hayward]], epitomized the idea that "suffering was the price of glamor...[and] the women stars of the [1950s] reflected the condition of many gay men: they suffered, beautifully".&lt;ref name="Culture Clash" /&gt;

[[File:Lucy YankArmy cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Actress [[Lucille Ball]] in 1945]]
Garland's daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] would later follow in her mother's footsteps as a gay icon, as would fellow musical artist [[Barbra Streisand]].&lt;ref name="POP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra.com.ar"/&gt; [[Joan Crawford]] has been described as the "ultimate gay icon—the martyr who suffered for her art and, therefore, enabled herself to bond with this all-important faction of her fanbase."&lt;ref name="Joan Crawford"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bret |first=David |title=Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2008 |pages=192, 287 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-cf2gT2bRG8C |isbn=0-306-81624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography'', author [[Lawrence J.

Bret explains that seeing the actress' red hair, dark eyes and "Victory Red" lips linked her to "gaydom's other sirens: Dietrich, Garland, Bankhead, Piaf, and new recruits [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Maria Callas."&lt;ref name="Joan Crawford" /&gt;

Actress [[Lucille Ball]] was also a prominent icon from this period. In Lee Tannen's book ''I Loved Lucy: My Friendship with Lucille Ball'', the author describes his experience when he witnessed Lucille Ball being labeled a gay icon for the first time by a mutual friend.&lt;ref name="Lucille Ball"&gt;{{cite book

=====1970s=====
During the late 1970s, many female comedians appeared, joining the ranks of what had stereotypically been a male profession, including [[Joan Rivers]], who began appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Rivers gained a strong gay following after performing in [[Greenwich Village]], an LGBT friendly area of New York, from the early days of her career. Rivers' frank and sharp use of wit and insults (largely turned toward herself) made her an instant gay icon. 
[[File:Donna Summer 1977.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Donna Summer]] was a prominent gay icon of the underground gay disco scene.]]

The first gay icon of the 1970s underground gay disco scene was the "Queen of Disco" [[Donna Summer]], whose dance songs became [[Gay anthem|anthems for the clubbing gay community]], and her music the back beat to the battles of the gay rights movement of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=pinklist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-3431.html |title=Gordon Ramsay 50th most popular gay icon |last=Grew |first=Tony |work=Pink News |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her number one single "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]"—regarded as an "absolute disco epic"—not only became a gay anthem because of its "unabridged sexuality", but it also brought European-oriented disco to the United States and influenced the course the recording industry would take in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Creswell |first=Toby |title=1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |year=2006 |page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=A_xtSKdVGpQC |isbn=1-56025-915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Summer became immersed in controversy when, after becoming a [[Born again (Christianity)|Born again Christian]], and during a 1983–84 tour, at the dawn of the [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis, she was allegedly reported as making homophobic remarks; including that "AIDS was God's punishment to homosexuals."

Singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]] became a gay icon after releasing his [[Hi-NRG]] single "[[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)]]" in 1978. Sylvester often made appearances in [[Drag queen|drag]], and often described as a disco diva because of his [[falsetto]] voice and flamboyant appearance. He also influenced the gay nightclub scene in the late seventies and eighties. Sylvester died of [[AIDS]]-related complications in [[1988]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/7850196/sylvester-pioneer-lgbtq&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Cass Elliot]] became known as a gay icon, both during her solo career and as a member of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. Her musical impact became known through her camp fashion and lyrics praising individuality (such as "[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (song)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]" and "Different") and free love. Her music was later featured in the acclaimed gay film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' (1996), adapted from the play of the same name.

Singer and actress [[Bette Midler]] became recognized as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the [[Continental Baths]], a [[gay bathhouse]] in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist [[Barry Manilow]], who produced her first major album ''[[The Divine Miss M]]'' (1973). "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [singing at gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride," Midler reminisced in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bette Midler |work=Houston Voice |date=October 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oprah Winfrey]] is credited by many in the US as allowing gay people to become mainstream, due to her popularization of the tabloid talk show genre.]]

In the mid- to late-1980s, [[Oprah Winfrey]] emerged as an icon for the gay community with an intimate confessional communication style that altered the cultural landscape. According to the book ''Freaks Talk Back'' by Yale sociologist [[Joshua Gamson]], the [[tabloid talk show]] genre popularized by Oprah Winfrey and [[Phil Donahue]], did more to make gay people mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century by providing decades of high-impact media visibility for sexual nonconformists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=40916 |title=Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity, Gamson |publisher=Press.uchicago.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0879727527 |title=Coming after Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV Talk Show (9780879727529): Vicki Abt, Leonard Mustazza: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow gay icon [[Ellen DeGeneres]] cast Winfrey to play the therapist she comes out of the closet to on the controversial episode of her ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' sitcom. Though Winfrey abandoned her tabloid talk show format in the mid-1990s as the genre became flooded by more extreme clones like [[Ricki Lake]], [[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]] and [[Jerry Springer]], she continued to broadcast shows that were perceived as gay-friendly. Her show ''[[Oprah's Big Give]]'' was the first reality TV show with an openly gay host [[Nate Berkus]]. Her own show has been nominated several times for [[GLAAD Media Award]]s, and another in 2010 for an interview with Ellen DeGeneres and her wife [[Portia de Rossi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/glaad-glad-name-media-award-nominees-20080121/ |title=GLAAD Glad Name Media Award Nominees / Queerty |publisher=Queerty.com |date=January 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning one in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/2007/03/27/patti_labelle_w |author1=Kieth Boykin |title=Patti LaBelle Wins GLAAD Media Award |work=Kiethboykin.com |date=March 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121222209/http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/2007/03/27/patti_labelle_w |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/03/14/glaad-media-awards.html |title=Cynthia Nixon, Joy Behar win gay media awards – Arts &amp; Entertainment – CBC News |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317132740/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/03/14/glaad-media-awards.html |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oprah Winfrey also co-produced the Oscar-winning film ''[[Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire|Precious]]'' (2009), which was honored by GLAAD for portraying a lesbian couple as heroines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moviefone.ca/2010/01/13/precious-a-single-man-among-glaad-nominees/ |title='Precious,' 'A Single Man' Among GLAAD Nominees |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185853/http://www.moviefone.ca/2010/01/13/precious-a-single-man-among-glaad-nominees/ |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] was [[List of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender firsts by year|the first openly gay man to be elected to office in the U.S.]] and spearheaded the defeat of statewide [[Briggs Initiative|anti-gay ballot measure Proposition 6]] in California in 1978. While he and Moscone were assassinated shortly thereafter, both became viewed as martyrs for gay rights.

An ironic icon is [[Anita Bryant]], who worked to oppose homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Anita Bryant"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steele |first=Bruce C. |title=Milestones |publisher=The Advocate |date=November 12, 2002 |url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid22690.asp |accessdate=July 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202123232/http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid22690.asp |archivedate=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, Bryant led a national campaign, "[[Save Our Children]]", that conflated homosexuality and [[pedophilia]] and insisted that, because homosexuals cannot reproduce, they must "recruit" or "convert" people to their lifestyle.&lt;ref name="SOC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagert |first=Kelly Boyer |title=The 1970s |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2007 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FPHZbVhQQTUC |isbn=0-313-33919-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; California State Senator [[John Briggs (politician)|John V. Briggs]] applauded Bryant's work as a "national, religious crusade [and] courageous stand to protect American children from blatant homosexuality".&lt;ref name="SOC" /&gt; However, as Bruce C. Steele of ''The Advocate'' wrote, Bryant's crusade against the Gay Rights Movement made her synonymous with it.

{{Quote|About 10 years ago, I was at an American Booksellers Association convention where Bryant was ... still pissing and moaning about how the homosexuals had destroyed her career as spokesperson for Florida orange juice. The irony is, it wasn't the orange juice boycott that caused her to lose her job; it was the fact that she made herself forever associated with homosexuality. So, in one way, she was a victim of homophobia herself: Folks on the orange board didn't want people to think about queers when they bought orange juice."&lt;ref name="Anita Bryant" /&gt;|as told to Bruce C. Steele| ''The Advocate''}}

According to John Coppola, exhibit curator and former head of exhibits at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC, "In a completely unintended way, Anita Bryant was about the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement ... She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".&lt;ref name="Mother"&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating Anita Bryant: The Mother of Gay Rights |publisher=Pensito Review |date=July 4, 2007 |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2007/06/04/celebrating-anita-bryant-the-mother-of-gay-rights |accessdate=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30th anniversary of Bryant's campaign against LGBT rights has been commemorated at the [[Stonewall Library &amp; Archives]], with executive director Jack Rutland dubbing her "The Mother of Gay Rights".&lt;ref name="Mother" /&gt;

==Fictional==
Various fictional characters have been regarded as gay icons, including cartoon figures. [[Bugs Bunny]], a fictional [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] rabbit appearing in animation by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] during the [[Golden Age of American animation]]—dubbed the greatest cartoon character of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]''—has been declared a "queer cultural icon [and] parodic diva" due to his "cross-dressing antics" and camp appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bugs Bunny tops greatest cartoon characters list |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=July 30, 2002 |accessdate=February 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208043937/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |archivedate=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Raymond |title=Images in the Dark: An Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video |publisher=TLA Publications |year=1994 |page=455 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iGxZAAAAMAAJ |isbn=1-880707-01-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGowan |first=Kate |title=The Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory: 1995 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1998 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T7pSf0PZteEC |isbn=0-631-20896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comic book characters are considered gay icons. Homosexual interpretations of [[Batman]] and the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]], have been of interest in cultural and academic study, due primarily to psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name="The Complete History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |author2=Chip Kidd |title=Batman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2004 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=73wknu2cVIkC |isbn=0-8118-4232-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, Wertham led a national campaign against comic books, convincing Americans that they were responsible for corrupting children and encouraging them to engage in acts of sex and violence.&lt;ref name="The Complete History" /&gt; In relation to Batman and Robin, Wertham asserted "the Batman type of story helps to fixate homoerotic tendencies by suggesting the form of an adolescent-with-adult or [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]-[[Zeus]] type of love-relationship".&lt;ref name="Seduction"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bosmajian |first=Haig A. |title=Burning Books |publisher=McFarland |year=2006 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UkAXPuObVBUC |isbn=0-7864-2208-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Containing America: Cultural Production and Consumption in Fifties America'', authors Nathan Abrams and Julie Hughes point out that homosexual interpretations of Batman and Robin existed prior to Wertham's ''Seduction of the Innocent''.&lt;ref name="Fifties America"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abrams |first=Nathan |author2=Julie Hughes|title=Containing America: Cultural Production and Consumption in Fifties America |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qhLZsBLjV28C |isbn=1-902459-06-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wertham claimed his book was, in fact, prompted by the earlier research of a California psychiatrist.&lt;ref name="Fifties America" /&gt; The relationship between Batman and arch villain the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] has also been interpreted by many as homoerotic. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], author of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a "homophobic nightmare," and views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting, concluding, "He'd be much healthier if he were gay."&lt;ref name=batman&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharrett |first=Christopher |chapter=Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller |title=The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1991 |isbn=0-85170-276-7 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One TV series that appeals most to [[LGBT culture]] is the 1960s sitcom ''[[Bewitched]]''. Aside from the campy characterizations, it contained three gay cast members ([[Dick Sargent]], [[Paul Lynde]] and—allegedly—[[Agnes Moorehead]]). Star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and Sargent were grand marshals of a Los Angeles [[gay pride parade]] in the early 1990s. Another example is [[Bianca Montgomery]] of ''[[All My Children]]''.&lt;ref name="WWW.afterellen.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=Yimm |title=Olga Sosnovska, AMC's Unlikely Lesbian Icon |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]] |date=April 2004 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116110907/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
[[File:Tammy Faye Messner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tammy Faye Messner]] went from [[Televangelism|televangelist]] to gay icon.]]
Many celebrities have responded positively to being regarded as gay icons, several noting the loyalty of their gay fans. [[Eartha Kitt]] and Cher credited gay fans with keeping them going at times when their careers had faltered.&lt;ref name=gbl&gt;{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Leigh W. |title=The Gay Book of Lists, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Alyson Publications]] |year=2003 |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=87–88 |isbn=1-55583-740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kylie Minogue has acknowledged the perception of herself as a gay icon and has performed at such events as the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]. Asked to explain the reason for her large gay fanbase, Minogue replied, "It's always difficult for me to give the definitive answer because I don't have it. My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me." She noted that she differed from many gay icons who were seen as tragic figures, with the comment, "I've had a lot of tragic hairdos and outfits. I think that makes up for it!"&lt;ref name=kyliecomment&gt;{{cite web |last=Ives |first=Brian |author2=Bottomley, C. |title=Kylie Minogue: Disco's Thin White Dame |publisher=[[VH1]].com |date=February 24, 2004 |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1485255/02232004/minogue_kylie.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tammy Faye Messner]] (ex-wife of fellow controversial [[televangelist]] [[Jim Bakker]] and mother of pastor [[Jay Bakker]]), who benevolently has been referred to as "the ultimate drag queen,"&lt;ref name="tfbakker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson-Smith |first=Anthony |title=Tammy Faye's Fab Fan Club |work=[[Maclean's]] |page=7 |date=May 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; said in her last interview with [[Larry King]] that, "When I went—when we lost everything, it was the gay people that came to my rescue, and I will always love them for that."&lt;ref name="tfbakker2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rabey |first=Steve |title=Tammy Faye, gay icon |work=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=85–86 |date=October 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have been more ambivalent. [[Mae West]], a gay icon from the early days of her career, supported [[gay rights]] but bristled when her performance style was referred to as camp.&lt;ref name=maewest&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Jill |title=Mae West: An Icon in Black and White |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |year=2001 |location=New York |page=300 |isbn=0-19-510547-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna has acknowledged and embraced her gay following throughout her career, even making several references to the gay community in her songs or performances, and performed at several gay clubs. She has declared in interviews that some of her best friends are gay and that she adores gay people and refers to herself as "the biggest gay icon of all times."&lt;ref name=madonnainterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gay.com/headlines/9191 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028054912/http://uk.gay.com/headlines/9191 |archivedate=October 28, 2005 |title=Madonna: 'I hope I'm still a gay icon' |work=[[Gay.com]] |date=October 26, 2005 |accessdate=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has been quoted in television interviews in the early 1990s as declaring the "big problem in America at the time was homophobia."

Grayling]] (''Wittgenstein,'' Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work ''might'' have possibly played some "''second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century''", ''neither'' Gilbert Ryle ''nor'' any of those in the so-called "[[Ordinary language philosophy]]" school that is chiefly associated with [[J. L. Austin]] (and, according to Grayling, [[G. E. Moore]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. J. Ayer]]) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that "''most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them''"&lt;/ref&gt; and is principally known for his critique of [[Cartesian dualism]], for which he coined the phrase "the [[ghost in the machine]]." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle's best known book is ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert.''The Concept of Mind''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002. Pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], if you are at home with that label."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Ryle, "Phenomenology versus ''The Concept of Mind''," in ''Collected Papers'', London: Hutchinson, 1971, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ryle was born in [[Brighton]], England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and [[astronomy]], and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at [[Brighton College]], and in 1919 he went up to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study [[Classics]] but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a "triple first": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), ''literae humaniores'' (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1925. A year later, he became a Student ([[Fellow]]) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Tanney | first = Julia | title = Gilbert Ryle | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab | location = Stanford, CA | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ | accessdate = 5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] and Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He published his principal work, ''The Concept of Mind'' in 1949. He was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

His brothers [[John Alfred Ryle|John Alfred]] (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at [[Brighton College]] as well, also had eminent careers. John became [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the [[Forestry Commission]] 1963–65 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

==Work==
===''The Concept of Mind''===
{{Main|The Concept of Mind}}

In ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle argues that dualism involves [[category mistake]]s and philosophical [[nonsense]]. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-philosophy.com/ryle-concept-mind-summary|title=Ryle: The concept of mind (Summary)|website=www.the-philosophy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy as cartography===
{{cquote|The philosophical arguments which constitute this book are intended not to increase what we know about minds but to rectify the logical geography of the knowledge we already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Mind p 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ryle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that "philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities."&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

Ryle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like [[cartography]]. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and [[geography]]. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls "implication threads." In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Knowing-how and knowing-that===
{{main|Descriptive knowledge|Procedural knowledge}}
A distinction deployed in ''The Concept of Mind'', between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is also the origin of [[Procedural memory|procedural]] (knowing-how) and [[Declarative memory|declarative]] (knowing-that) models of [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].

Ryle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_ryle.html|title=Gilbert Ryle &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the [[ordinary language philosophy]] movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]''. The two major post-War schools in the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[representationalism]] of [[Jerry Fodor]] and the [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student [[Daniel Dennett]] has pointed out, recent trends in [[psychology]] such as [[embodied cognition]], [[discursive psychology]], [[situated cognition]] and others in the [[post-cognitivist]] tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that "theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=vii, 483 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">[[Image:Boaistuau.gif|thumb]]'''Histoires tragiques''' ('tragic stories') were a genre of French fiction in 16th-17th centuries, a [[Baroque]] rendering of [[Boccaccio]]'s type of [[short stories]], concentrating on the dark side of human nature.

The progenitor of this kind of a story was [[Pierre Boaistuau]] with his translation of [[Matteo Bandello]]'s ''Novelli'' published in French as ''Histoires tragiques'' (1559). Boaistuau selected from Bandello six most dark and gorey stories and changed them for his means. He was followed by [[François de Belleforest]] who adapted 12 more stories for the new edition in 1570.

Those dark mood stories were imitated by writers like [[Jacques Yver]] (''Le Printemps d’Yver'', 1572), [[Vérité Habanc]] (''Nouvelles Histoires tant tragiques que comiques'', 1585), [[Bénigne Poissenot]] (''Nouvelles Histoires Tragiques'', 1586), [[Alexandre Sylvain]] (''Epitomes de cent histoires tragicques'', 1581), and [[Bruneau de Rivedoux]] (''Histoire véritable de certains voyages périlleux et hasardeux sur la mer'', 1599).

[[François de Rosset]] began to borrow plots for his tragic stories from contemporary crime chronicle (''Les Histoires tragiques de nostre temps'', 1615), and this innovation proved to be extremely popular.

Another important author is [[Jean-Pierre Camus]] who adds infernal and diabolical theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">In [[sociology]], an '''industrial society''' is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Such a structure developed in the [[Western world]] in the period of time following the [[Industrial Revolution]], and replaced the [[agrarian society|agrarian societies]] of the [[Modern history#Pre-modern|pre-modern]], [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] age. Industrial societies are generally [[mass society|mass societies]], and may be succeeded by an [[information society]]. They are often contrasted with [[traditional society|traditional societies]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B.

[[industrialization|Industrial]] societies use external energy sources, such as [[fossil fuels]], to increase the rate and scale of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/98/04717398/0471739898.pdf |title=Chapter 1: Energy Fundamentals, Energy Use in an Industrial Society |website= |accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as [[combine harvesters]] and fossil fuel based [[fertilizers]], are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these [[factories]] where [[mechanization]] is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and [[mechanization]] is further refined, often to the level of [[automation]], many workers shift to expanding [[service industries]].

Industrial society makes [[urbanization]] desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the [[service industry]] can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding [[suburb]]an areas with a high rate of [[economic activity]].

These [[urban area|urban centers]] require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the [[diminishing returns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arthur |first=Brian |title=Positive Feedbacks in the Economy |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=262 |pages=92–99 |date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby [[arable land]], associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGranahan |first=Gordon |authorlink= |date=November 2003 |title=URBAN CENTERS: An Assessment of Sustainability |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=28 |issue= |pages=243–274 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105541 |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.

Some theoreticians (namely [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]], and [[Manuel Castells]]) argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]]. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was [[steam power]], allowing [[mass production]] and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus, many industrial cities have been built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or [[informational society]] is global [[information technology]].

Some, such as Theodore Kaczynski, have argued that an industrialized society leads to [[psychological pain]] and that citizens must actively work to return to a more primitive society. His essay, ''[[Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', describes different political factions and laments the direction of technology and the [[modern world]].

"'''Justify My Love'''" is a song by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her first [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits compilation]] album ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990). It was released on October 30, 1990, by [[Sire Records]] as the [[lead single]] from ''The Immaculate Collection''. The song was written by [[Lenny Kravitz]] and [[Ingrid Chavez]], with additional lyrics by Madonna. Chavez was not credited on the song, which led to a lawsuit against Kravitz. Chavez settled out-of-court, the terms of which included a songwriting credit. Madonna's vocals are primarily spoken and whispered, but almost never sung, a style which she again employed on her following studio album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' (1992).

Musically, "Justify My Love" is a [[trip hop]] inspired song, with mid-tempo settings and instrumentation. The lyrics of the song are primarily about [[sex]] and [[romance (love)|romance]]. "Justify My Love" received mixed reviews from older critics, but was critically appreciated by many contemporary critics, noting it as one of Madonna's best songs to date. The song became Madonna's ninth number one single on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], while reaching the Top 10 in several countries including Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna as a woman walking in a hotel hallway, looking distressed and tired from work, until being seduced into having sex with a mysterious man and woman. It caused controversy worldwide, due to its explicit sexual images, and was subsequently banned from [[MTV]] and other TV networks. The video, which contained imagery of [[sadomasochism]], [[voyeurism]], and [[bisexuality]], made its US television debut December 3, 1990 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during its late-night news program ''[[Nightline]]''. The song was part of the setlist of three of her [[Concert|concert tours]], the most recent being [[The MDNA Tour]] in 2012.

==Background==
"Justify My Love" was originally written and recorded by [[Ingrid Chavez]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[protégé]] and friend, and [[Lenny Kravitz]]: he and producer André Betts composed the music while Chavez penned the lyrics based on a poem she had written for Kravitz, and read them aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vibe.com/article/exclusive-prince-collaborator-ingrid-chavez-deep-ep-debut |title= Exclusive: Prince Collaborator Ingrid Chavez 'Deep' EP Debut |date= June 21, 2013 |last1=Hernandez |first1= Jorge |website= ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' |accessdate= April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kravitz added the title [[hook (music)|hook]] and [[refrain|chorus]] to the demo while Madonna corrected one line.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315180,00.html |title= Justify My Claim |date= August 16, 1991 |last1=Ressner |first1= Jeffrey |website= ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |accessdate= April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavez was not credited for the song and later sued Kravitz in 1992: she received an out-of-court settlement, and gained a co-writing credit for her work. When the lawsuit was settled, Chavez's attorney Steven E. Kurtz clarified that Madonna's additional writing credit was not questioned in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/Settlement-Reached-in-Lawsuit-over-Justify-My-Love-Credit/id-18da79ec116d10caa5da624264703e6a |title = Settlement Reached in Lawsuit over 'Justify My Love' Credit |date = January 29, 1992 |agency = Associated Press |accessdate= April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released on November 6, 1990, three days before the release of the [[The Immaculate Collection|compilation]]. 

Producer Kravitz used the [[drum kit|drums]] found on [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s instrumental, "[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back|Security of the First World]]",&lt;ref name="Citypages"&gt;Thomas, Lindsey. (March 8, 2006) [http://www.citypages.com/2006-03-08/news/she-bop/full/ "She Bop"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012050322/http://www.citypages.com/2006-03-08/news/she-bop/full/ |date=2013-10-12 }}. ''City Pages''.&lt;/ref&gt; without consent, which was in turn based on the end drum break of [[James Brown]]'s "[[Funky Drummer]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315180,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Jeffrey | last=Ressner | title=Justify My Claim | date=1991-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it as the basis of the song. The song was unusual in that Madonna's vocals are primarily spoken and whispered, but almost never sung. This style served as a prelude to her next album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'', in which she spoke the lyrics on some of the songs rather than singing them. Kravitz and Madonna provided [[background vocals]]. Chavez' had previously provided the "spoken intro" to Prince's 1988 song "[[Lovesexy|Eye No]]",&lt;ref&gt;

==Composition==
Composed as a midtempo song, "Justify My Love" is a [[trip hop]]-inspired song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Alfred Publishing]], the song is set in [[common time]], with a [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of 100 [[beats per minute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spotontrack.com/track/justify-my-love/810771|title=Spot On Track - The Spotify Tracker|website=www.spotontrack.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed in the key of [[B minor]] with Madonna's voice ranging from the tonal nodes of A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;"Digital Sheet Music – Madonna – Justify My Love". Musicnotes.com. Alfred Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jim Farber from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', he described the song's musical beat and Madonna's vocals as "vague, tuneless phrases chanted in Madonna's most breathless voice over a minimal house groove — serves mainly to justify the visuals."&lt;ref&gt;By Jim Farber | Dec 14, 1990 [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318863,00.html It's Bad. But Is It Good?] ''Entertainment Weekly''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''The Immaculate Collection'', David Browne said that she introduced an "adult" pop. The song features "heavy breathing with a backbeat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318856,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Music Review: The Immaculate Collection, by Madonna | date=December 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] had compared the song composition to the songs on Madonna's ''Erotica'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2207|title=Robert Christgau: Album: Madonna: The Immaculate Collection|publisher=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Lamb from ''[[About.com]]'' said the song is "quite powerful and enthralling in its dreamy, beat heavy celebration of carnal coupling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/Top-50-Sexy-Pop-Songs.02.htm|title=Top 50 Most Essential Sexy Pop Songs|author=Bill Lamb|work=About.com Entertainment|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
Madonna and [[Lenny Kravitz]] remixed the song and named it "The Beast Within". It was included on the 12" vinyl and CD maxi-single release in North America. The [[remix]] uses only the chorus and certain lines of the original song, with the verses being replaced by passages from the [[Book of Revelation]]. Subsequent live concert performances have simply billed the song as "The Beast Within", a song in its own right, it is now no longer referred to as a remix.&lt;ref name="secret"/&gt; The song first garnered media attention early in 1991 when the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] accused the song of containing [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] lyrics; specifically the lyric "those who say that they are [[Jews]], but they are not. They are a [[Synagogue]] of [[Satan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-04/entertainment/ca-7949_1_simon-wiesenthal-center|title=Anger Over Madonna Single|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 4, 1991|accessdate=September 18, 2016|first=Chuck|last=Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
"Justify My Love" received acclaim from many music critics. In a separate review from [[Allmusic]], they gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating "[Justify My Love] stands as one of the best of Madonna's long history of well-packaged maxi-singles, and further helped set a precedent for the maxi-single market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/justify-my-love-mw0000255293|title=Justify My Love - Madonna - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Jose F. Promis|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' by David Browne, he gave it a positive remark saying that people who have a "hoo-haa" surrounding the banning of the single "underestimate her". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' had said along with "Rescue Me" are "worthy sensual newies".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/madonna/albumguide Rolling Stone | Madonna: Album Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing ''Celebration'', Bill Lamb from ''[[About.com]]'' said "Songs such as "Justify My Love" that sounded a little over-indulgent when first released have worn very well over time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/madonnacelebrationalbum.htm|title=Madonna - Celebration|author=Bill Lamb|work=About.com Entertainment|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra Capotorto from PopCrush.com said "'Justify My Love' is perfectly constructed lovemaking music. While this track might be oozing sex, it's the NSFW music video that caused the most drama [...]"&lt;ref name="popcrush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/sex-songs/|title=Top 10 Sex Songs|work=PopCrush|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==

===Background===
The [[music video]] for "Justify My Love" was directed in Paris on November 9, 1990 by [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]], who had also worked with Madonna in her video for "[[Open Your Heart (Madonna song)|Open Your Heart]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/28/arts/madonna-video-goes-too-far-for-mtv.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Holden | title=Madonna Video Goes Too Far for MTV | date=November 28, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features Madonna's then-boyfriend, [[model (person)|model]] and [[actor]] [[Tony Ward (entertainer)|Tony Ward]]. Some of the dancers featured in the video were also dancers from her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. It is a tribute to [[Jeanne Moreau]] of ''[[La Baie des Anges]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Madonna as post-modern myth'', Georges-Claude Guilbert&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she declared it her favorite music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/17/madonna-reddit-ama_n_3940717.html|title=Madonna Reveals Favorite Songs, Album Urges And Much More In Reddit AMA|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synopsis===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jml-pic 021.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna in the now-infamous music video for "Justify My Love".]] --&gt;

The video was filmed in grainy black and white in the style of a 1960s European art film. There are also several shadowy film-noir elements such as characters seen only in silhouette. The action takes place in an elegant hotel that apparently caters to alternate lifestyle couples. Madonna (or the character she's playing) enters looking tired and distressed as she walks down the hallway toward her room. There she has a romantic fling with a mysterious man (played by [[Tony Ward (entertainer)|Tony Ward]]). Some of the doors to the other rooms are ajar and we catch glimpses of various couples cavorting in [[BDSM]] fetish outfits (leather, PVC T-shirts, latex underwear, and corsets).

In a dream-like sequence, Madonna rolls around in bed wearing skimpy lace underwear and a garter belt and stockings while various figures come and go. The entire nudity (which led to the video being banned) occurs when a topless [[dominatrix]]-type woman, played by model Wallis Franken—suspenders partly covering her breasts—appears and roughly grabs a bound man (the same man who is with Madonna) by the hair. Her outfit, which includes a peaked leather hat and black gloves, copies the ensemble worn by [[Charlotte Rampling]] in the controversial film ''[[The Night Porter]]''.  (Both the film and the video share elements of sadomasochism.) The theme of [[androgyny]] is also briefly alluded to when a woman who closely resembles Madonna's lover is seen in men's clothing with a drawn-on pencil mustache. The overall presentation is surreal and deliberately ambiguous. The retinue of strange characters may be real or simply fantasies from Madonna's imagination. In the end, a rejuvenated Madonna rushes out of the hotel room smiling and laughing.

===Controversy and ban===
The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.&lt;ref name=rebel&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285759,00.html|title=Madonna Banned|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=May 27, 2008|last=Rich|first=Joshua|date=November 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna responded to the banning: "Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|2002|p=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 1990, ABC's ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' played the video in its entirety, then interviewed Madonna live about the video's sexual content and censorship. When asked whether she stood to make more money selling the video than airing it on MTV, she appeared impatient and answered, "Yeah, so? Lucky me." She also expressed during the interview that she did not understand why MTV banned the video yet allowed videos that contained violence and degradation to women to continue receiving regular airplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Madonna speaks on Nightline|episodelink=Nightline (US news program)|series=Nightline|credits=Interviewer: [[Forrest Sawyer]]|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=December 3, 1990|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was then [[Justify My Love (video)|released in VHS]], and became a bestselling "video single".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-03-30/madonna-top-controversies/ |title=Madonna's Top 11 Controversies (And How They Helped Her Succeed Commercially) |work=VH1 Music News |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712025608/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-03-30/madonna-top-controversies/ |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video for "Justify My Love" was banned also from regular rotation on [[MuchMusic]] in Canada, although the controversy (as well as the subsequent banning of a video by [[Mitsou]]) led MuchMusic to launch a new series, ''[[Too Much 4 Much]]'', which played controversial music videos accompanied by panel discussions on their artistic and cultural context.&lt;ref name=citizen&gt;"MuchMusic to play two racy videos only once". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', April 26, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the video was aired in its entirety on [[MTV2]] as part of a special countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. This countdown was shown only late at night because of the graphic imagery of "Justify My Love" and several other videos on the countdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/controversialvideos/controvids.jhtml |title=The Controversial Videos |publisher=MTV |accessdate=September 19, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020521203844/http://www.mtv.com/onair/controversialvideos/controvids.jhtml |archivedate=May 21, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many complaints were received, the video was played without restriction on the [[Australian Broadcasting  Corporation]]'s popular music video show [[Rage_(TV_program)|Rage]]; as, being a public broadcaster, the ABC is not bound to follow classification guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qt.com.au/news/rage-hits-30-years-old/3164581/|title=Rage Hits 30 Years Old|publisher=The Queensland Times|date=2017-04-08|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
"Justify My Love" was the first [[VHS]] video single to be released by Madonna. This was the first time an artist had released a single in this format. Released on [[VHS]] only, the packaging in North America was a plain black slip cover with a sticker around it, so that it resembled a "seedy video". In Europe, it was given the full cover artwork treatment, and they also included a bonus video of Madonna's performance of "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" at the 1990 MTV Music Video Awards, which was ironic as MTV had banned the title track. In the UK, the video was given an "18" certificate by the [[BBFC]], meaning no one under that age could legally buy or see the release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/madonna-justify-my-love-1990 BBFC.co.uk Madonna Justify My Love]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its release, the video peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard's Top Music Videos Chart]] for two weeks and spent 39 weeks in the chart overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70757/ask-billboard |title=Ask Billboard |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |date=June 4, 2003 |website=Billboard |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video was released on [[DVD]] for the first time on the greatest hits package ''[[Celebration: The Video Collection]]'' in 2009. This version of the video was censored with [[censor bars|black bars]] in a scene that contains female nudity. In Australia, the video was rated "M" and in New Zealand, the video was rated "R16" for sex scenes.

==Usage in media==
On the May 11, 1991 episode of the sketch-comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Madonna made a guest appearance in a pre-filmed segment which spoofed her controversial music video as well as her just-released ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]'' film.

During a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' sketch, Wayne ([[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]) and Garth ([[Dana Carvey]]) encounter a seductive Madonna lying on a bed in a hotel room during a fantasy dream sequence (also filmed in black and white). After some back-and-forth banter, Wayne and Madonna play Truth or Dare. Wayne begins by saying "Truth." Madonna then asks "Have you ever made love with two women at the same time?" Wayne answers "Uh...yes!" to which Madonna says "Okay, I believe you....[[not!]]" Wayne then dares Madonna to make out with him. As they kiss, the music for "Justify My Love" begins to play. Garth is then seen dancing in a parody of the video before being abducted by two women in fetish-wear outfits.

==Live performances==
[[File:MDNA 7581415740.jpg|thumb|Dancers performing during the "Justify My Love" video interlude on [[The MDNA Tour]].]]
Madonna performed the song twice during [[The Girlie Show World Tour]] in 1993, the original version and also the "Beast Within remix". The latter was used as a dancers interlude during the show. The "remix" was again used as the video introduction to the 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]], including imagery of Madonna from the exhibition ''[[X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS]]'', prior to her appearing on stage. It was subsequently included on the 2006 live album, ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (album)|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]''. This new version omits the controversial lyrics which caused the 1991 accusations.&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (album)|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]''|others=Madonna|year=2006|publisher=Warner Bros. Records|id= 9362-49990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was remixed again by [[William Orbit]] and used on [[The MDNA Tour]] as a video interlude. The black-and-white backdrop video, directed by Tom Munro, features Madonna being chased by people in carnival masks and locks herself in a room to indulge into her fantasies, while the masked followers search for her. The video is said to be a metaphor for everybody trying to take advantage of her, judge her or exploit her private life, and the interlude is her expression of escaping the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madonnarama.com/posts-en/2012/05/29/exclusive-spoilers-all-the-juicy-details-on-the-mdna-tour/|title=All the juicy details on the MDNA Tour|publisher=Madonnarama|date=2012-08-16|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samples of the song were also used during the SEX video/performance interlude on the [[Rebel Heart Tour]].

==Legacy==
"Justify My Love" has remained one of Madonna's most controversial singles to date. As a result of all the controversy, the single was released as a video-single and went on to become the highest selling video single of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-15-most-nsfw-music-videos-of-all-time-20110713/madonna-justify-my-love-1990-0480243|title=Madonna, 'Justify My Love' (1990)|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually becoming certified four-times platinum by the [[RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madonna-online.ch/m-online/discography/90_the-immaculate-collection/disco-90-jusify-my-love-single.htm discography – justify my love, 1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915094339/http://www.madonna-online.ch/m-online/discography/90_the-immaculate-collection/disco-90-jusify-my-love-single.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}. madonna-online.ch (1990-12-10).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">A '''knowledge society''' generates, shares and makes available to all members of the [[society]] knowledge that may be used to improve the [[human condition]]. A knowledge society differs from an [[information society]] in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action while the latter only creates and disseminates the [[raw data]].&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi"&gt;Castelfranchi, C. (2007).  [https://jcom.sissa.it/sites/default/files/documents/Jcom0604(2007)C03.pdf Six critical remarks on science and the construction of the knowledge society].  ''Journal of Science Communication, 6''(4), 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout [[History of the world|human history.]] However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and [[Science communication|information dissemination]] that results from the [[innovation]] of [[Information technology|information technologies]].&lt;ref name="Vallima"&gt;Vallima, J. &amp; Hoffman, D. (2008).  Knowledge society discourse and higher education.  ''Higher Education, 56''(3), 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2005).  Toward knowledge societies.  ''UNESCO World Report''.  Conde-sur-Noireau, France:  Imprimerie Corlet.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information and communication technology ==

The growth of [[Information and communication technology]] (ICT) has significantly increased the world’s capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the [[Internet]] delivered unheard-of quantities of [[information]] to people. The [[evolution]] of the internet from [[Web 1.0]] to [[Web 2.0]] offered individuals tools to connect with each other [[World Wide Web|worldwide]] as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and [[mobile device]]s offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform [[education]], [[training]], [[employment]] and access to life-sustaining resources for all members of society.&lt;ref name="VanWeert"&gt;van Weert, T. J. (2006).  Education of the twenty-first century:  New professionalism in lifelong learning, knowledge development and knowledge sharing.  ''Education and Information Technologies, 11''(3), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
However, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in [[knowledge]] creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create [[awareness]], meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind.&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi" /&gt; Absent reflection and [[critical thinking]], information can actually become "non-knowledge", that which is false or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Innerarity"&gt;Innerarity, D. (2012).  Power and knowledge:  The politics of the knowledge society, ''European Journal of Social Theory, 16''(1), 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P.L. (2010).  Applying social systems thinking and community informatics thinking in education.  In Rudestam, K.E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (Eds.), 91-128.  ''Handbook of online learning''.  Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T. (2009, Mar 13).  Tim Berners-Lee:  The next web of open, linked data [Video].  Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social theory ==

The [[social theory]] of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the [[politics]], [[economics]], and culture of [[Modernity|modern society.]] Associated ideas include the [[knowledge economy]] created by economists and the [[learning society]] created by educators.&lt;ref name="Vallima" /&gt; Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, [[individual]]s, [[Community|communities]], and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. [[Peter Drucker]] viewed knowledge as a key [[Economic resources|economic resource]] and coined the term [[knowledge worker]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P.F. (1969).  ''The age of discontinuity:  Guidelines to our changing society''.  New York, NY:  Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; Fast forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Paavola, S. &amp; Hakkarainen, K. (2005).  The knowledge creation metaphor:  An emergent epistemological approach to learning.  Science &amp; Education, 14, 535-557.&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
A knowledge society promotes [[human rights]] and offers equal, inclusive, and [[universal access to all knowledge]] creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society:&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;
*[[Cultural diversity]]	
*Equal access to [[education]]
*[[Universal Access|Universal access]] to information (in the [[public domain]])
*[[Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression]]

However, they acknowledge that the [[digital divide]] is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;Sanou, B. (2013).  The world in 2013:  ICT fact and figures.  Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, [[geography]], age, [[gender]], [[language]], [[education]], social and cultural background, [[employment]] and [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

== Politics ==

To reduce the span of the digital divide, [[Leadership|leaders]] and [[Politician|policymakers]] worldwide must first develop and understanding of knowledge societies and second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for [[decision-making]].  Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact [[human]]kind. [[Science]] is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased [[ignorance]] or non-knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, M. (2010). ''Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, [[probability]], [[risk]] and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt;

To confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and [[observation]] of consequences.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt; Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome versus find the perfect solution.  [[Democratization]] of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.

== Education ==

As technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; For a society where [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[counting]] are a requisite for [[Activities of daily living|daily living]], skills in reading, [[writing]], and [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic]] are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

One marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands [[lifelong learning]], knowledge development, and [[knowledge sharing]]. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education [[professional]]s will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between [[technology]] and [[Education|teaching]].&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the [[W. Edwards Deming]] [[PDCA|Plan-do-check-act cycle]]&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; that promotes [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]]. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.

'''Male expendability''' is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman.

[[Øystein Gullvåg Holter]] argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovan War|Kosovo]], [[Timorese War|Timor]], [[Rwandan War|Rwanda]], and [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holter |first=Øystein Gullvåg |authorlink=Øystein Gullvåg Holter |title=A theory of gendercide |journal=[[Journal of Genocide Research]] |date=March 2002 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=11–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of [[sex object]] to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivana Milojević |title=Why the Creation of a Better World is Premised on Achieving Gender Equity and on Celebrating Multiple Gender Diversities |journal=[[Journal of Futures Studies]] |date=June 2012 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' or ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that [[Adolf Hitler]] considered gay men expendable by means of [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[Nazi medical experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=J. Michael |title=From Gay Men's Lives: Toward a More Inclusive, Ecological Vision |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |date=May 1993 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=347–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manosphere]] critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men "are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women".&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|author=[[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] |date=February 3, 2014 |title=What Kind of Man Joins the Men's Rights Movement? |publisher=GQ |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Block]] argues in ''The Case for Discrimination'' that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population. This theme was echoed in [[Warren Farrell]]'s ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]''.

The '''Maximums''' is a [[DC Comics]] team of [[super heroes]] parodying [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Ultimates]] and [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], including the lower-case speech bubbles associated with the [[Ultimate Universe]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' battlecry "Avengers Assemble!" to their "Maximums March!" They are based in [[San Francisco]].

They were introduced in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 (June 2005) as inhabitants of an alternate world. It was eventually revealed they had been created by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]].

==Origin==
The Maximums were creations of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. They imagined a U.S. government sanctioned superhero team from a parallel world.

During in the middle of a battle with the Axis of Evil, the Maximums encountered [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] from an alternate timeline, whom they claimed that Skyscraper murdered their Lois Lane. Superman kills Skyscraper and after the ensuing battle with the Maximums, escape via Boom Tube. With mysterious information provided by their fallen comrade, Bowman (who was actually impersonated by the Joker), the Maximums track Superman and Batman to their reality.

While Batman and Superman are fighting the Atomic Skull who was stealing a briefcase with radioactive materials in it from Wayne Tech, the Maximums appear, seeking revenge. The Soldier fires a bullet at the Skull, and it passes through Superman's hand and causing the Skull to violently release a large amount of radiation that Superman acts to contain. Although Robot observes Superman's heroic act, Viking will have none of it. Soldier and Monster attempt to subdue Batman when Batzarro intervened, blinding everyone with his "smoke" bombs. Eventually, the Maximums were able to capture Superman and Batman, and returned to their world via Boom Tube.

After imprisoning Superman and Batman in Alcatraz prison, the Maximums were underestimated by the heroes who they then easily escaped their prison. Superman fought Viking and Robot, who the latter no longer believed that they murdered Skyscraper, while Batman was attacked and defeated by Wolfen. However, the Bowman/Joker visited Lex Luthor and returned to the Maximums reality and releases the Kryptonite Man into an imprisoned Batman, possessing him.

The Kryptonite Man-possessed Batman fought with Superman while the Maximums argued over their fate. Superman used Robot's exterior armor to encase K-Man and force him out of Batman's body. Immediately thereafter, [[Bizarro]] and Batzarro appeared and attempted to rescue their idols to safety, but only for Batzarro to be stranded in the Maximums' reality.

Both Joker and Mxy then anticipated in having the Maximums into battling various versions of Superman and Batman; Joker wanted to kill "every Batman there ever was or there ever will be." while on Mxy's part planned in freeing Darkseid from the Source Wall. However, Mxy had orchestrated this game into not only freeing Darkseid but Bat-Mite as well as Mxy was unable to directly free his fellow 5th Dimensional imp, and had to have a creation of the Joker do it himself. He explained to Superman and Batman that they, Darkseid and himself will play a central role in an upcoming Crisis. With Mxy's plan came to fruition, the Maximums were ceased to exist.

The members include:
* '''Soldier''' ([[Captain America]]): Real name possibly Scout. A military minded and uncompromising leader, apparently the first "super-soldier" of his world. His son "Lucky" ([[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]]) is proverbially the only super-soldier to stay dead.
* '''Viking''' ([[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]): Red-bearded, [[berserker]] son of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|frost giants]], who wields an axe forged by [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]]. The axe is capable of wounding Superman.
* '''Robot''' ([[Iron Man]]/[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]): A living machine, believed by some to be a man in armour. Demonstrates calm and reason in battle.
* '''Monster''' ([[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]): Real name Becky. A young girl who becomes a rampaging monster, which is referred to with male pronouns. Vulnerable to electrical discharges. And eventually  turns green from [[kryptonite]].
* '''Skyscraper''' ([[Henry Pym|Giant Man]]): Real name Harvey. Apparently killed by Superman. Unlike Giant Man, Skyscraper's enormous size seems to be permanent.
* '''Hornet''' ([[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]): Real name Jaime. Appears much more insect like than her Marvel Universe and Ultimate counterparts. Shown charmed by Godiva's mental powers. During her appearance she seeks vengeance for the death of her boyfriend, the Skyscraper.
* '''Bowman''' ([[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]): Real name Clive. Deceased by the time of the story, but (supposedly) still appearing as a [[ghost]].
* '''Wolfen''' ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]/[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]): Physically resembles the Beast, with Wolverine's costume markings on his fur. Like Wolverine, he tends to go into berserker rages.
* '''Bug''' ([[Spider-Man]]): Wisecracking young insect-based hero with four arms.

==Enemies==
Apart from Batman and Superman, the team's greatest enemies are the Axis of Evil, parodying the [[Masters of Evil]]. The Axis members are [[Godiva (comics)#Superman/Batman villain|Godiva]] ([[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|the Enchantress]]); Annihilate ([[Executioner (comics)|The Executioner]]); Demise ([[Grim Reaper (comics)|the Grim Reaper]]); and Rapier ([[Swordsman (comics)|the Swordsman]]/[[Black Knight (comics)|the Black Knight]]).

Other villains may include the Bug's archenemy Halloween (based on the [[Green Goblin]]), although the appearance of Halloween throwing Kristen off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (modeled after the death of [[Spider-Man]]'s former girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]]) turned out to be a ploy to distract Superman.

Hornet has commented that the team seems to spend most of the time fighting itself, most notably a battle with former member the Chaos Witch in which Bowman was killed (a reference to the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'').

The Maximums' Earth also includes a version of [[Ghost Rider]] named the Skull Biker, but nothing more is known about him, except that his powers are Satanic in origin.

Additionally, [[Captain Atom]] was briefly sent here as a result of an atomic explosion involving [[Kryptonite]]. While recuperating, he was delusional, glowing green, and destroyed several buildings. He was, essentially, this Earth's equivalent to the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]].

"'''Men Against Fire'''" is the fifth episode of the third series of British science fiction [[anthology series]] ''[[Black Mirror]]''. Written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by [[Jakob Verbruggen]], it premiered on [[Netflix]] on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Mirror Season 3 Will Premiere Sooner Than We'd Thought|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/black-mirror-season-3-will-premiere-sooner-than-wed-tho-1784411507|website=The Verge|language=en-US|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode, set in a future with [[dystopia]]n and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] elements, tells the story of Stripe ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a soldier in a military organization hunting and exterminating mutants known as "roaches". When his squad, which also includes his friend and partner "Hunter" ([[Madeline Brewer]]) and their squad leader Medina ([[Sarah Snook]]), encounters roaches, Stripe kills two of them; despite earning praise for his performance, he starts feeling different. [[Ariane Labed]] and [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] co-star as a woman saved by Stripe and a military psychologist, respectively.

==Plot==
"Stripe" Koinange ([[Malachi Kirby]]) and "Hunter" Raiman ([[Madeline Brewer]]) are squadmates in a military organization that hunts down and exterminates mutant humans, dubbed "roaches", in a post-apocalyptic future. Each soldier has a [[neural implant]] called MASS that enhances the processing of their senses (including sight, sound, and smell), provides instant data via [[augmented reality]], and creates comforting sex dreams at night.

Stripe and Hunter's squad follows a lead to a farmhouse. The team searches the grounds while squad leader Medina ([[Sarah Snook]]) interrogates the farm's owner, a devout Christian ([[Francis Magee]]), whom she suspects is harbouring roaches in accord with his beliefs. Medina's suspicions are confirmed, as Stripe discovers a complete secret "nest" of roaches – revealed to be pale, snarling, humanoid monsters with sharp teeth; when one of them points a mysterious [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] device at Stripe, he and Hunter open fire on them. Afterwards, Stripe picks up the LED device and accidentally flashes himself in the eyes. Medina arrests the owner and orders the farmhouse torched. The device Stripe flashed in his eyes appears to have disrupted his MASS interface, which sporadically glitches during his training regimens the following day. Stripe undergoes a [[medical examination|physical examination]] and sees a psychologist, Arquette ([[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]]); neither visit reveals any medical problems.

The next day, Medina, Stripe and Hunter arrive at an abandoned housing complex to look for further roaches. Stripe experiences another glitch: his sense of smell, seemingly dampened, suddenly returns. In the very next moment, a roach sniper kills Medina. Stripe and Hunter scour the sniper's nest and Stripe encounters what he perceives to be a regular human woman. He urges the woman to flee but Hunter shoots her dead. In a subsequent firefight, it is clear that Stripe is seeing humans where Hunter sees roaches. Stripe attempts to stop Hunter from continuing the massacre and knocks her out, but gets injured and then escapes with a frightened woman ([[Ariane Labed]]) and her boy.

The fleeing woman, Catarina, explains that Stripe's MASS implant has altered his senses to disguise the fact that "roaches" are actually regular humans. In fact, roaches are the victims of a [[genocide]] against those believed to be genetically inferior, following a global war ten years before. Catarina remarks that soldiers have MASS but everyday civilians do not; they simply hate the roaches due to propaganda and prejudice. Hunter suddenly reappears, killing Catarina and her son and knocking Stripe unconscious.

Stripe awakes inside a military prison cell, where Arquette explains that the LED device had sent viral coding to Stripe's MASS, causing it to glitch so that he could see roaches as human beings. Arquette then reveals the true secret purpose of the MASS implants: to augment the visual appearance of the persecuted humans to make them look zombie-like and frightening, to alter their voices to sound like monstrous nonsensical growls, to diminish the smells of blood and gore, and to selectively erase certain memories. MASS is used by the military to dehumanize the appearance of the enemy, allowing soldiers to kill them more efficiently and without remorse. Stripe, it turns out, has been working for a global [[eugenics]] program to "protect the bloodline" of humanity, something Stripe passively agreed to. Though his memory of agreeing to this has been erased by MASS, Arquette confirms it with video footage, and he also plays the raw footage of Stripe's farmhouse mission, except the roaches' appearances have not been augmented to look like monsters and so it is indeed revealed that he has been killing terrified ordinary humans. Stripe pleads with him to stop the footage and Arquette threatens to imprison Stripe, endlessly looping the raw footage, if Stripe does not consent to wipe his memory of the last few days and get his MASS system reset.

Stripe is later shown being discharged with full military honors, implying he consented to a second erasure of his memory. He approaches what his eyes show to be an immaculate house and a waiting dream girl, but in actuality he stands alone outside a graffiti-tagged, dilapidated shack.

==Production==
The episode was written by [[Charlie Brooker]], who was inspired by a documentary about the [[Iraq War]] which featured a civilian speaking for several minutes uninterrupted, and [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]]'s book, ''[[On Killing]]'', which is about the psychology of killing and based on Brigadier General [[S.L.A. Marshall]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2016/10/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-technology-television/|title=The Man Behind Netflix’s "Black Mirror" Is Maybe a Little Too Good at Predicting the Future|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|last=Mechanic|first=Michael|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/black-mirror-postmortem-interview-season-3|title=Black Mirror postmortem: Showrunner talks season 3 twists|date=21 October 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the episode comes from Marshall's book ''Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command'' (1947), wherein Marshall claims that during [[World War II]], over 70% of soldiers did not fire their rifles, even under immediate threat, and most of those who fired aimed above the enemy's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/men-against-fire-how-many-soldiers-actually-fired-their-weapons-at-the-enemy-during-the-vietnam-war.htm|title=Men Against Fire: How Many Soldiers Actually Fired Their Weapons at the Enemy During the Vietnam War|publisher=Historynet.com|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement is made during one of Arquette's dialogues in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/black-mirror-postmortem-interview-season-3|title=Black Mirror postmortem: Showrunner talks season 3 twists|date=21 October 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58348">A '''multinational state''' is a [[sovereign state]] that comprises two or more [[nation]]s. This is in contrast to a [[nation state]], where a single nation accounts for the bulk of the population. Depending on the definition of "nation" (which touches on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], language, and political identity), a multinational state might also be [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]].

Present-day examples of multinational states are [[Afghanistan]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iraq]], [[Madagascar]], [[Montenegro]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Suriname]],[[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Examples of historical multinational states that have since split into multiple sovereign states include [[Austria-Hungary]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. Some analysts have described the [[European Union]] as a multinational state or a potential one.&lt;ref name="Built to Last"&gt;Kelemen, R. Daniel. (2007). {{cite web |url= http://www.princeton.edu/~smeunier/Kelemen%20Memo.pdf |title= Built to Last? The Durability of EU Federalism? |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120153312/http://www.princeton.edu/~smeunier/Kelemen%20Memo.pdf |archivedate= 2013-01-20 |df=  }} In ''Making History: State of the European Union'', Vol. 8, edited by [[Sophie Meunier]] and Kate McNamara, Oxford University Press, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=gHw9M_817nwC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=The+EU+as+a+multinational+state&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qV58MWGiHB&amp;sig=bmJIs-lRC84mJ8uJIDYLbNzHPKg&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nDqlVPXDD8LsaO3qgpAE&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwCA|title=A Union of Diversity: Language, Identity and Polity-Building in Europe|first=Peter A.|last=Kraus|date=10 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many attempts have been made to define what a multinational state is. One complicating factor is that it is possible for members of a group that could be considered a nation to identify with two different nationalities simultaneously. As Ilan Peleg wrote in ''Democratizing the Hegemonic State'': {{quote|sign=|source=|One can be a Scot and a Brit in the United Kingdom, a Jew and an American in the United States, an Igbo and a Nigerian in Nigeria ... One might find it hard to be a Slovak and a Hungarian, an Arab and an Israeli, a Breton and a Frenchman.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Peleg, 'Classifying Multinational States' in ''Democratizing the Hegemonic State'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007), pp. 78-80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A state may also be a [[society]], and a '''multiethnic society''' has people belonging to more than one ethnic group, in contrast to societies that are [[Monoculturalism|ethnically homogeneous]]. By some definitions of "society" and "homogeneous", virtually all contemporary national societies are multiethnic. The scholar David Welsh argued in 1993 that fewer than 20 of the 180 sovereign states then in existence were ethnically and nationally homogeneous, if a homogeneous state was defined as one in which minorities made up less than 5 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Welsh|first=David|title=Ethnic Conflict and International Security|editor=Brown, Michael E.|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=1993|pages=43–60|chapter=Domestic politics and ethnic conflict|isbn=0-691-00068-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cstjhpRd-F4C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=domestic+politics+and+ethnic+conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sujit Choudhry]] therefore argues that "[t]he age of the ethnoculturally homogeneous state, if ever there was one, is over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Choudhry|first=Sujit|title=Constitutional Design for Divided Societies: Integration or Accommodation?|editor=Choudhry, Sujit|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2008|pages=3–40|chapter=Bridging comparative politics and comparative constitutional law: Constitutional design in divided societies|isbn=0-19-953541-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Neil MacGregor]], Director of the [[British Museum]], the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] written by [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was "the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths—a new kind of statecraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fa/contents/articles/opinion/2013/03/cyrus-cylinder-iran-religious-freedom-minority-rights.html |title=Cyrus Cylinder a Reminder of Persian Legacy of Tolerance |author=Barbara Slavin |publisher=Al-Monitor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922133011/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fa/contents/articles/opinion/2013/03/cyrus-cylinder-iran-religious-freedom-minority-rights.html |archive-date=2013-09-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]'' provides a list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ethnic makeup of every country in the world.

===Americas===

==== Canada ====
{{main article|Constitutional debate in Canada}}
Whether [[Canada]] should be described as "multinational" is an ongoing topic in academia&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=84E6E773BDEF479B932020EAA8F06170.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=275793 Cambridge Journals Online - Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue canadienne de science politique - Abstract - Canada and the Multinational State]. Journals.cambridge.org. Retrieved on 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and popular discourse. The current policy of the federal government is that Canada is [[official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]]—English and French [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|are both official languages]]—and [[multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]]. In 2006, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] voted in favour of ''Government Business No. 11'', which states that the [[Québécois people|Québécois]] "form a nation within a united Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2539924|title=Journals No. 87 - November 27, 2006 (39-1) - House of Commons of Canada|website=www.parl.gc.ca|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bolivia ====
Since 2010, under the [[presidency of Evo Morales]], [[Bolivia]] has been officially defined as a [[Plurinationalism|plurinational state]], which recognizes the national distinctiveness of various [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous peoples]].

===Asia===
Many Asian countries recognise multiple ethnic groups:

====India====
{{further information|Ethnic groups of India}}
[[India]] has more than 2,000 ethnic groups and over 80,000 subcultures, and every major religion is represented, as are four major [[Language family|language families]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]], [[Austroasiatic]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]]) and a [[language isolate]] ([[Nihali]]).

Each state and [[union territory]] of India has one or more official languages, and the [[Constitution of India]] recognizes in particular 22 "[[Languages with official status in India|scheduled languages]]". It also recognizes 212 scheduled tribal groups, which together constitute about 7.5% of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} {{Further information|Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes}}

India has a [[Islam in India|Muslim]]-majority state ([[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and a Muslim-majority union territory ([[Lakshadweep]]); three [[Christianity in India|Christian]]-majority states ([[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], and [[Nagaland]]); and a [[Sikhism in India|Sikh]]-majority state ([[Punjab, India|Punjab]]). Most of its states are based on ethnicity, including [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]],  [[Rajasthan]], and  [[Chhatisgarh]] ([[Hindustani people|Hindustani]]), [[Tamil Nadu]] ([[Tamil people|Tamil]]), [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] ([[Telugu people|Telugu]]), [[Karnataka]] ([[Kannada people|Kannadigas]]), [[Odisha]] ([[Odia people|Odia]]), [[Jammu and Kashmir]] ([[Dogra|Dogras]] and [[Kashmiris]]), [[Goa]] ([[Konkani people|Konkanis]]), [[Gujarat]] ([[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]), [[West Bengal]] ([[Bengali people|Bengali]]), [[Maharashtra]] ([[Marathi people|Marathi]]), [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] ([[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]), [[Haryana]] ([[Haryanvi People|Haryanvi]]), and [[Kerala]] ([[Malayali]]).

Furthermore, several Indian states are themselves ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse. [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] are home to the [[Maithils]], [[Santali people|Santalis]] and the [[Hindustani people|Hindustani language]] speaking people. [[Karnataka]] is home to the [[Tulu people|Tulu]] and [[Kannada people]]; Jammu and Kashmir consists of [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-majority [[Jammu]], Muslim-majority [[Kashmir]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]-majority [[Ladakh]]; and [[Assam]] includes the [[Assamese people|Assamese]], [[Bodo people|Bodo]], and [[Karbi people]].

====Indonesia====
{{further information|Ethnic groups in Indonesia}}
There are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia

====Nepal====
{{further information|Demographics of Nepal}}
[[Nepal]] does not have a majority ethnic group, and its society is multiethnic, multireligious, and multilingual. Aside from the country's indigenous people, most Nepalese are descendants of migrants from Kashmir, [[Greater Nepal]], [[Tibet]], India, and parts of [[Myanmar]] and China's [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]].

[[Khas people|Khas]] and [[Mongoloid|Mongoloids]] populate the hilly areas of Nepal, while the [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]], a diverse group live in the southern plains. The indigenous [[Tharu people]] are also among the early settlers of the [[Terai|Terai region]]. The [[Himalayas]] are sparsely populated above 3,000 m (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft), but north of the mountains, in central and western Nepal, ethnic [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] and [[Tamang people|Tamangs]] inhabit high, [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] valleys. The [[Kathmandu Valley]], in the middle hill region, constitutes a small fraction of the nation's area but is the most densely populated, with almost 5 percent of the nation's population. 

====Sri Lanka====
{{further information|Demographics of Sri Lanka}}
[[Sri Lanka]] is inhabited by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]], [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]], [[Veddas]], [[Burgher people|Burghers]], and other small ethnic groups.

====Afghanistan====
{{Further information|Ethnic groups in Afghanistan}}
[[Afghanistan]] has no ethnic majority, although the [[Pashtuns]] are estimated to account for over 45% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2001/war_on_terror/key_maps/ethnic_pashtun.stm|title=Ethnic groups|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 June 2013|quote=Pashtun: Estimated to comprise more than 45% of the population, the Pashtuns have been the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the sovereign governance of Pashtun rulers, the term "Afghan" was changed from an [[ethnonym]] for Pashtuns to a [[demonym]] for any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of ethnic affiliation. This change was incorporated into the constitution, making it resemble that of a multinational state. However, [[irredentist]] disputes over [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Pakistan's Pashtun lands]] have continued. 

Other ethnic groups in Afghanistan include [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Aimaq people|Aimaqs]], [[Turkmens]], and [[Baloch people|Balochs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government gives equal status to [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari language|Dari]] as official languages.

====Pakistan====
{{further information|Ethnic groups of Pakistan}}
Present-day [[Pakistan]] arose out of the [[Pakistan Movement]], which demanded a separate state for the Muslims of the [[British Raj]]. The movement was based on the [[two-nation theory]] put forward by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]: the idea that Hindus and Muslims in British India represented not only different religious communities but also distinct nations, and hence that, in the event of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], they should be divided into two nation states. Jinnah (known in Pakistan as "Quaid-e-Azm", meaning "the great leader"){{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} outlined the theory as follows:

{{quote|It is extremely difficult to appreciate why our Hindu friends fail to understand the real nature of Islam and Hinduism. They are not religious in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, literatures. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state."&lt;ref name=dt-march&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2011%5C03%5C23%5Cstory_23-3-2011_pg3_6|title=VIEW: March towards independence|publisher=Daily Times|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="res3"&gt;[http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp Excerpt from the Presidential Address delivered by Quaid-e-Azam at Lahore, March 22–23, 1940] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628044030/http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp |date=2006-06-28 }}, Nazariapak.info&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This movement culminated in the creation of Pakistan in 1947 through the [[partition of India]]. [[Urdu]] was then promoted as the national language of all [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|South Asian Muslims]]. However, Pakistan remains ethnically diverse. [[Punjabis]] are the largest language group, but at 45 percent of the population, they do not make up an absolute majority. Furthermore, only 8 percent of Pakistanis speak the national language, Urdu, as their [[First language|mother tongue]]. As a result, many nationalist movements that oppose the two-nation theory have emerged, arguing that Pakistan is not only a linguistically diverse state but also a multinational one, and that, therefore, each ethnolinguistic group of Pakistan is a distinct nation.&lt;ref name=pakethnat &gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Politics in Pakistan|page=2|author=Tariq Rahman|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common grievances of these movements include the idea that Punjabis dominate Pakistan politically and economically, thus marginalizing other groups, and that the establishment of Urdu as the country's sole official language is a form of [[cultural imperialism]] that ignores the heritage of Pakistan's diverse peoples.

The most successful of these movements was [[Bengali nationalism]], which led to the creation of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-speaking nation-state of [[Bangladesh]]. The movement asserted that Urdu's official status gave an unfair advantage to [[Muhajir people|Muhajirs]] (most of whom speak Urdu as their mother tongue) and Punjabis (whose mother tongue, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], is similar to Urdu, and many of whom were educated in Urdu under British rule). Bengalis feared they would be marginalized despite their demographic strength as, at the time, the largest ethnic group of Pakistan. These grievances culminated in the secession of [[East Bengal]] (which had been part of the administrative unit of [[East Pakistan]]) and the creation of Bangladesh.

Today, nationalist movements within Pakistan include those of the [[Sindhi nationalism|Sindhis]], [[Pashtun nationalism|Pashtuns]], [[Baloch nationalism|Balochs]], [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|Mohajirs]], and [[Kashmiriyat|Kashmiris]]. The members of these movements assert that Islam cannot be considered the sole basis for nationhood, and that Pakistan is therefore a multinational state. Their demands range from increased autonomy or the transformation of Pakistan into a [[federation]], to the recognition of [[language rights]] for non-Urdu-speaking populations, to outright secession.

Despite the fact that Punjabis are widely seen as the dominant ethnic group in Pakistan, both economically and politically, there is also a small [[Punjabiyat|Punjabi movement]] that asserts that the Punjabi language has been unfairly subordinated to Urdu and supports the reestablishment of cultural and economic links with [[East Punjab]] in India.&lt;ref name=punjnat&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.apnaorg.com/articles/rahman2.html|title='The Punjabi Movement' from ''Language and Politics in Pakistan''|author=Tariq Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
When it was formed on 16 September 1963, [[Malaysia]] comprised four independent, self-governing nations: [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], and [[Sarawak]]. In 1965, Singapore seceded from the federation. Today, Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak each have their own ethnic majority. Generally, however, Malaysia is considered to have three major ethnic groups: [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], and [[Malaysian Indian|Indians]]. The [[Iban people]] are the majority in Sarawak, while Sabah is dominated by the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], [[Murut people|Murut]], and [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Bajau peoples]]. [[Malay language|Malay]] is the primary national language, followed by [[English language|English]]. In Sabah and Sarawak, English is the official language, although many locals speak a dialect of Malay.

==== People's Republic of China ====
{{main article|List of ethnic groups in China}}
Although the population of [[China]] is dominated numerically by the [[Han Chinese]], the government recognizes [[List of ethnic groups in China|56 ethnic groups]]. Fifty-five of the 56 groups together account for less than 10 percent of the population.

=== Europe ===
{{further information|Ethnic groups in Europe}}
[[Montenegro]] is the only European state with no ethnic majority, but many others have ethnic minorities that form a majority within a province or region (see [[multilingual countries and regions of Europe]]).

==== Russian Federation ====
[[Russia]] has more than 160 ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. The largest population are the ethnic [[Russians]], who are [[Slavs]] with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] religious traditions, while the [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] are predominantly Muslim. Russia is also home to Buddhist populations, such as the [[nomad]]ic [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]]; the [[Shamanism|Shamanistic]] peoples of [[Siberia]] and the [[Far North (Russia)|Far North]]; the [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian Northwest]] and the [[Volga region]]; the [[Sakhalin Koreans|Korean inhabitants of Sakhalin]]; and the peoples of the [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php Ethnic groups in Russia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622084055/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php |date=2011-06-22 }}, at demoscope.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of a total of more than 100 languages spoken in Russia, 27 have the status of [[Languages of Russia|official languages]], the most widely spoken being [[Russian language|Russian]]. More than 3 percent of the population speaks [[Tatar language|Tatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html Russia - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531133402/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/russia-country-profile.html |date=2013-05-31 }} at kwintessential.co.uk, accessed 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Belgium ====
{{further information|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}
The territory of [[Belgium]] is almost equally divided between the two nations of [[Flemish]] [[Flanders]] and [[Francophone]] [[Wallonia]]. This led to political unrest throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and in the aftermath of the difficult [[2007–08 Belgian government formation]], the Belgian media envisaged a [[partition of Belgium]] as a potential solution. There is also a [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking minority in the east]].

==== Bosnia and Herzegovina ====
[[File:Map Bih entities.png|thumb|200px|Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH), the [[Republika Srpska]] (RS), and the [[Brčko District]] (BD).]]
[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is home to three ethnic "[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]]": [[Bosniaks]] (50.11%), [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] (30.78%), and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] (15.43%).&lt;ref name=Popis2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Census of population, households and dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2013: Final results|url=http://www.popis2013.ba/popis2013/doc/Popis2013prvoIzdanje.pdf|publisher=Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=June 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's political divisions were created by the [[Dayton Agreement]], which recognized a second tier of government comprising two entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (mostly Bosniaks and Croats) and the [[Republika Srpska]] (mostly Serbs), with each governing roughly half of the state's territory. A third region, the [[Brčko District]], was governed locally. Today, all three ethnic groups have an equal constitutional status over the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country has a [[bicameral|bicameral legislature]] and a [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|three-member presidency]] composed of one member of each major ethnic group.

==== France ====
In order to maintain a nation state, [[France]] does not recognize any [[French people|national identity]] or [[French language|language]] other than French in its territory. However, many of its current and former territories—[[Alsace]], [[Brittany]], [[Corsica]], [[Flanders]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], [[Northern Catalonia]], [[Occitania]], [[Savoy]], and the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]]—were not culturally French until they were [[Francization|francized]] in the late 19th century. According to [[WikiLeaks]], former Prime Minister [[Michel Rocard]] told the American ambassador to France, [[Craig Roberts Stapleton]], in 2005, "France created itself by destroying five cultures: Breton, Occitan, Alsatian, Corsican, and Flemish."

==== Montenegro ====
[[File:MontenegroEthnic2011.PNG|thumb|200px|A map showing the predominant ethnic group in each municipality of Montenegro as of 2011.]]
[[Montenegro]] is a multiethnic state in which no ethnic group forms a majority. The preamble of the [[Constitution of Montenegro]] identifies numerous nationalities—[[Montenegrins]], [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]], [[Bosniaks of Montenegro|Bosniaks]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]], [[Islam in Montenegro|Muslims]], [[Croats of Montenegro|Croats]], and others—as citizens of a civic and democratic state. The largest ethnic groups are Montenegrins (45%), Serbs (28.7%), Bosniaks (8.6%), Albanians (4.9%), and Muslims (3.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje(1).pdf |title= Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Montenegro 2011 |publisher=Monstat |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 census, Serbian was the most common mother tongue (42.88%), Montenegrin the second (36.97%), and Bosnian the third (5.33%).

==== Spain ====

{{main article|Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain}}
Definitions of ethnicity and nationality in [[Spain]] are politically fraught, particularly since the transition from [[Francoist Spain]] to the Kingdom of Spain in the 1970s, when local regionalisms and peripheral nationalisms became a major part of national politics. 

The term [[Spanish people]] (Spanish: ''pueblo español'') is defined in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] as the political sovereign, i.e., the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution, in its preamble, speaks of "peoples and nationalities of Spain" (''pueblos y nacionalidades de España'') and their respective cultures, traditions, languages, and institutions.

The ''CIA World Factbook'' (2011) describes Spain's ethnic makeup as a "composite of Mediterranean and Nordic types", instead of the usual breakdown of ethnic composition. This reflects the formation of the modern Kingdom of Spain by the accretion of numerous independent [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] realms: [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Asturias]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Majorca]], [[Navarre]], and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]]. Thus, today's Spaniards include [[Andalusians]], [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], [[Asturians]], [[Basques]], [[Cantabrian people|Cantabrians]], [[Castilians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galicians]], [[Leonese people|Leonese]], and [[Valencian people|Valencians]], and individual members of these groups may or may not consider them distinct nations.

The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was created on 1 May 1707 by the [[political union]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;William E. Burns, ''A Brief History of Great Britain'', p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; This unification was the result of the [[Treaty of Union]], which was agreed to on 22 July 1706 and then ratified by the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/articles_union.htm|title=Articles of Union with Scotland 1707 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two kingdoms, along with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], had already been in a [[personal union]] as a result of the 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], in which [[James I of England|James VI, King of Scots]], inherited the Kingdoms of England and Ireland and moved his [[court (royal)|court]] from [[Edinburgh]] to [[London]]. However, until 1707, all three had remained separate political entities with separate political institutions.&lt;ref name="D. Ross, 2002 p. 56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Hearn, 2002 p. 104"/&gt;

Prior to the Acts of Union, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland both had minority populations of their own that could themselves be called nations. [[Wales]] and [[Cornwall]] were part of the Kingdom of England (Wales had been officially incorporated into England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], although it had been a ''de facto'' English territory [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|since the 13th century]]; Cornwall had been conquered during the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]]). The [[Northern Isles]], with their [[Norsemen|Norse]]-derived culture, were part of Scotland, having been pledged by Norway as security against the payment of a [[dowry]] for [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/orkney-and-shetland-are-pawned-as-dowry/|title=Orkney and Shetland Are Pawned as Dowry ⋆ History Channel|date=2016-06-20|newspaper=History Channel|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then integrated in 1471. When the Kingdom of Great Britain was created, many of its inhabitants retained a sense of English, Scottish, or Welsh identity. Many of them also spoke languages other than English: principally [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Norn language|Norn]].

Almost a century later, the Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under the 1800 [[Act of Union (1800)|Acts of Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act |title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom thus became the union of the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland.&lt;ref name="D.

=== Africa ===
Most countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] are former colonies and, as such, are not drawn along national lines, making them truly multinational states. 
==== Ghana ====
During its colonial time Ghana was imperialized by many countries and empires including the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the Danish Empire and the German Empire. Ghana has also seen a large mass of Chinese, Malay, European, Lebanese, and other multinational immigrants.
==== Kenya ====
[[Kenya]] is home to more than 70 ethnic groups, the most populous of which are the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], at about 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/kethnic.htm|title=East Africa Living Encyclopedia|website=www.africa.upenn.edu|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the five largest groups—the Kikuyu, [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]], [[Luhya people|Luhya]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], and [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]—account for 70 percent of Kenyans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
The largest nation in [[Nigeria]] is the [[Hausa-Fulani]], which accounts for 29 percent of the country's population. However, the group actually encompasses two distinct ethnicities: the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and the [[Fulani]] (or Fulbe). While both ethnicities are found in large areas of [[West Africa]], it is only in Nigeria that they are classified as a single ethnic group for political expediency. 

====South Africa====
Present-day [[South Africa]] is the successor state to the [[Union of South Africa]], which was formed from four British colonies in 1910. 

South Africa has eleven official languages ([[Afrikaans]], English, [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Northern Sotho language|Pedi]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Swazi language|Swazi]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda language|Venda]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]) and formally recognises several other languages spoken by minority nations. Speakers of each language may be of a different nationality—for example, some members of the [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] nations speak Zulu, and groups such as the [[Thembu people|Thembu]] and [[Hlubi people|Hlubi]] speak Xhosa. 

As is the case throughout Africa, the nations of South Africa mostly correspond to specific regions. However, large cities such as [[Johannesburg]] are home to a mixture of national groups, leading to a "[[melting pot]]" of cultures. The government has continuously attempted to unify the country's various nationalities and to foster a South African identity. 

Many of the nationalities found in South Africa are also found in bordering countries, and in some cases, more members live in South Africa than in the country where the group originated. For example, there are more [[Sotho people|Sotho]], Tswana, and [[Swazi people|Swazi]] people living in South Africa than in the bordering nation states of [[Lesotho]], [[Botswana]], and [[Swaziland]], respectively. In the past, this has led to conflict. Lesotho still claims large swathes of South Africa, and attempts have been made to cede some South African territory to Botswana and Swaziland. All three states were intended to be incorporated in the Union of South Africa, but those plans never came to fruition because of power struggles within their [[apartheid]] governments.

{{Further information|Ethnic and religious composition of Austria-Hungary}}
[[Austria-Hungary]], which succeeded the [[Austrian Empire]], was a historical multinational state. The centrifugal forces within it, coupled with its loss in [[World War I]], led to its breakup in 1918. Its successor states included the [[First Austrian Republic]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which later became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Parts of Austria-Hungary were also incorporated into [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], the [[Kingdom of Romania]], and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The principal languages of Austria-Hungary were [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], but there were also many minor languages, including [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;''Volkszählung vom 31. Dezember 1910'', published in ''Geographischer Atlas zur Vaterlandskunde an der österreichischen Mittelschulen'' (Vienna, 1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] was the [[dynastic state]] of the Turkish [[House of Osman]]. At its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, it controlled much of [[Southeast Europe]], [[Western Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. 

In addition to [[Turkish people|Turks]], the ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire included [[Albanians]], [[Amazighs]], [[Arabs]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Bosnians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Laz people|Laz]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Romanians]], [[Serbs]], [[Tatars]], and [[Zazas]].

Through [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet courts]], [[confessional community|confessional communities]] were allowed to rule themselves under their own legal systems: for example, [[Sharia|sharia law]] for Muslims, [[Canon law]] for Christians, and [[Halakha|halakha law]] for Jews. After the [[Tanzimat]] reforms from 1839–76, the term "millet" was used to refer to legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word "nation". (The word "millet" comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word "millah" (ملة), which literally means "nation".){{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sachedina |first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |date=2001 |title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=96–97 |isbn=0-19-513991-7 |quote=The millet system in the Muslim world provided the pre-modern paradigm of a religiously pluralistic society by granting each religious community an official status and a substantial measure of self-government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Union]] was a state composed of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] (of which there were 15 after 1956), with the capital in [[Moscow]]. It was founded in December 1922, when the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]—which formed during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and emerged victorious in the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]]—unified with the [[Transcaucasian SSR|Transcaucasian]], [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]], and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian SSRs]]. Addressing the Extraordinary Eighth [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] on 25 November 1936, [[Joseph Stalin]] stated that "within the Soviet Union there are about sixty nations, national groups, and nationalities. The Soviet state is a multinational state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1936/11/25.htm On the Draft Constitution of the U.S.S.R] marxists.org, accessed 15 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, some of the republics sought sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|USSR Constitution]], which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v42/ai_9119705 The red blues&amp;nbsp;— Soviet politics] by Brian Crozier, ''[[National Review]]'', 25 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for secession in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html Origins of Moral-Ethical Crisis and Ways to Overcome it] by V.A.Drozhin Honoured Lawyer of Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Many held free elections, and the resulting legislatures soon passed bills that contradicted Soviet laws, in what became known as the [[War of Laws]].

In 1989, the Russian SFSR—the largest constituent republic, with about half of the USSR's population—convened a new [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] and elected [[Boris Yeltsin]] its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory]] and proceeded to pass legislation that attempted to supersede Soviet laws. Legal uncertainty continued through 1991 as constituent republics slowly gained ''de facto'' independence.

In [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|a referendum]] on 17 March 1991, majorities in nine of the 15 republics voted to preserve the Union. The referendum gave Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] a minor boost, and in the summer of 1991, the [[New Union Treaty]] was designed and agreed upon by eight republics. The treaty would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser federation, but its signing was interrupted by the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]]—an attempted [[coup d'état]] against Gorbachev by hardline [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] members of the government and the [[KGB]], who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. When the coup collapsed, Yeltsin—who had publicly opposed it—came out as a hero, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. 

As a result, the balance of power tipped significantly toward the republics. In August 1991, [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] declared their independence (following [[Lithuania]]'s 1990 example), while the other twelve republics continued to discuss new, increasingly loose models for the Union.

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. Doubts remained about the authority of the Belavezha Accords to dissolve the Union, but on 21 December 1991, representatives of every Soviet republic except [[Georgian SSR|Georgia]]—including those that had signed the Belavezha Accords—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the dissolution of the USSR and reiterated the establishment of the CIS. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev yielded, resigning as the president of the USSR and declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers vested in the Soviet presidency over to Yeltsin, the president of Russia.

The following day, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, dissolved itself. Many organizations, such as the [[Soviet Army]] and [[Militsiya|police forces]], remained in place in the early months of 1992, but were slowly phased out and either withdrawn from or absorbed by the newly independent states.

=== Yugoslavia ===
[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia.gif|thumb|250px|The breakup of the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].]]
The first country to be known by this name was the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], known until 3 October 1929 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was established on 1 December 1918 by the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (to which the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] had been annexed on 13 November 1918), and the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] gave international recognition to the union on 13 July 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|title=Interesting things about the royal order of Montenegro - Untitled|website=Orderofdanilo|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516203805/http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|archivedate=16 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the [[Axis powers]] in 1941 and abolished as a result of [[World War II]]. It was succeeded by Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, proclaimed in 1943 by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] resistance movement. When a communist government was established in 1946, the country was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1963, it was renamed again, becoming the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). This was the largest Yugoslav state, with [[Istria]] and [[Rijeka]] having been added after World War II.

The country consisted of six constituent "socialist republics" ([[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SR Croatia]], [[SR Macedonia]], [[SR Montenegro]], [[SR Slovenia]], and [[SR Serbia]]) and two "socialist autonomous provinces" ([[SAP Vojvodina]] and [[SAP Kosovo]], which became largely equal to other members of the federation after 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |title=[[The Clash of Civilizations|The clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order]] |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |ISBN=0-684-84441-9 |year=1996 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo/110492.stm |title=History, bloody history |publisher=BBC News |date=March 24, 1999 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1991, the SFRY disintegrated in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], which followed the secession of most of the country's constituent entities. The next Yugoslavia, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, existed until 2003, when it was renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. In 2006, this last vestige separated into Serbia and Montenegro, but only to go further in 2008 after [[Kosovo]] unilaterally declared its independence.

The '''''NAIDOC Awards''''' are annual Australian awards conferred on [[Australian Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] individuals during the national celebration of the history, culture and achievements of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples known as [[NAIDOC Week]].&lt;ref name=Awards&gt;{{cite web|title=NAIDOC Awards|url=http://www.naidoc.org.au/naidoc-awards|website=NAIDOC|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The committee==
The awards are named after the committee that was originally responsible for organising the national activities to mark NAIDOC Week, the ''National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee''.&lt;ref name=Awards/&gt; Each year, a different city hosts the National NAIDOC Awards Ceremony. The host city, National NAIDOC Poster Competition and the NAIDOC Awards recipients are selected by the National NAIDOC Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NAIDOC Week|url=http://www.naidoc.org.au/about|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are presented at the annual NAIDOC Awards Ceremony and Ball.&lt;ref name=Awards/&gt;

==Categories==
The names of the categories have varied over time. In 1985 Awards for Aboriginal of the Year, and for Aboriginal young people aged 12 to 25 were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAIDOC Posters 1972–1989|url=http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/naidoc/1972-1989.html|website=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current categories include Lifetime Achievement Award, Person of the Year, Female Elder of the Year, Male Elder of the Year, Caring for Country Award, Youth of the Year, Artist of the Year, Scholar of the Year, Apprentice of the Year and Sportsperson of the Year.&lt;ref name=Awards/&gt;

===Poster===
The first NAIDOC poster was created in 1972 to promote 'Aborigines Day' in support of better rights for Aboriginal people. The protest nature of the poster continued until 1977 with titles like 'Self Determination' and 'Chains or Chance' publicising political change and a day of remembrance. The 1978 poster reflected a decision by the recently established National NAIDOC Committee to move from a day of demonstration to a week long celebration in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAIDOC Poster|url=http://www.naidoc.org.au/naidoc-poster|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}
'''Politics''' (from {{lang-gr|πολιτικά|''Politiká''}}, meaning "affairs of the cities") is the process of [[Decision-making|making decisions]] that apply to  members of a group.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political|title=Political &amp;#124; Definition of Political by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than all [[Political science]], is sometimes referred to as [[Politology]] (not to be confused with [[Politicology]]).

In modern nation-states, people have formed political parties to represent their ideas. They agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Sartori|title=Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0954796617|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[election]] is usually a competition between different parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfxMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=1 April 2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0955820328|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in [[Germany]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]].

Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as "the art or science of government" and "political principles"), but often does carry a connotation of dishonest malpractice.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0765627315|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used negatively for many years: the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]] as published in 1745 calls on God to "Confound their politics",&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Gstk.png|God save our lord the king]], ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' 15 October 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "play politics", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: "We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iKyaxXvPYcQC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=We+do+not+play+politics;+anti-slavery+is+no+half-jest+with+us#v=onepage&amp;q=We%20do%20not%20play%20politics%3B%20anti-slavery%20is%20no%20half-jest%20with%20us&amp;f=false|title=American Orations: V.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, [[negotiation]] with other political subjects, making [[law]]s, and exercising [[force (law)|force]], including [[warfare]] against adversaries.&lt;ref name="Hammarlund1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bo Hammarlund|title=Politik utan partier: studier i Sveriges politiska liv 1726-1727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnRlAAAAIAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda P.

It is very often said that politics is about power.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Joe|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Alex|title=Political Geography|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculyork/reader.action?docID=10870263}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[political system]] is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. The [[history of political thought]] can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the works of [[Confucius]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Women voter outreach 1935 English Yiddish.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Women voter outreach from 1935.]]
The word comes from the same [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word from which the title of [[Aristotle]]'s book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (Πολιτικά, ''Polis'') also derives; ''polis'' means "affairs of the cities". The book title was rendered in [[Early Modern English]] in the mid-15th century as "Polettiques"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Diets and Sayings of the Philosophers'' (Early English Text Society, Original Series [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7G0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= No. 211], 1941; reprinted 1961), p. 154: "the book of Etiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and of Polettiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt; it became "politics" in [[Modern English]]. The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus|title=A Latin Dictionary|author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state",&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203856/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), "citizen"&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), "city".&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt;

===Classifications===
Formal politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

Semi-formal politics is politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where [[Students' union|student government political party]] politics is often important.

Informal politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that "politics is everywhere".&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

==History of state politics==
The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and [[economics]] of the institutions of [[government]].

===The state===
{{main article|State (polity)}}

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the ''[[Ancient warfare|art of warfare]]''. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21 August 1970|volume=169|issue=3947|doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733|pmid=17820299|pages=733–738|bibcode=1970Sci...169..733C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the American  Revolution put an end to the "[[divine right of kings]]".  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of [[hereditary monarchy]].

The king often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|council]] without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://history-world.org/absolutism.htm|work=International World History Project|title=European Absolutism And Power Politics|date=1998|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html|title=Constitutional Monarchy|publisher=British Monarchist League Ltd|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earl]]s and [[duke]]s in England and Scotland, the dukes and [[count]]s in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|pages=73–96|quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:2017.07.26 Protest Trans Military Ban, White House, Washington DC USA 7646 (36056769341).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Activism is a form of politics.]]
===Forms of political organization===
There are many forms of [[political organization]], including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.

According to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.

All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]]. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]] has a more dispersed system of [[judicial power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation|title=Confederation vs Federation – Difference and Comparison|publisher=Diffen|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Civil War]], the argument by the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union didn't stand because of the Federal government's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5EUNr295pgcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=In+the+American+Civil+War,+the+contention+of+the+Confederate+States+that+a+State+could+secede+from+the+Union+was+untenable+because+of+the+power+enjoyed+by+the+Federal+government+in+the+executive,+legislative+and+judiciary+branches#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20American%20Civil%20War,%20the%20contention%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20that%20a%20State%20could%20secede%20from%20the%20Union%20was%20untenable%20because%20of%20the%20power%20enjoyed%20by%20the%20Federal%20government%20in%20the%20executive,%20legislative%20and%20judiciary%20branches&amp;f=false|title=Social Sciences|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q=|pages=1–164|year=1900|publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Co.|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global politics===
{{main article|Global politics}}
'''Global politics''' include different '''practices''' of political [[globalization]] in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and relative fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the [[hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international '''organizations'''. The [[United Nations]] has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabinowitch|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Rabinowitch|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=World+politics+final+nuclear+holocaust&amp;q=World%20politics%20final%20nuclear%20holocaust|date=June 1973|page=13|issn=0096-3402|quote=...the rationale of traditional patterns of world politics.|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is radically undesirable for man, "[[nuclear blackmail]]" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Dulles|title=The Craft of Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mH3qdHK6_EsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=the+craft+of+intelligence+April+1963#v=onepage&amp;q=|page=224|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1599215778|quote=...using 'nuclear blackmail' as a threat to intimidate other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] from the implementation of U.S. vs [[Soviet Union]] nuclear blackmail policy.

According to [[political science]] professor [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], global politics is affected by ''values'': norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each:
{{quote|Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2014|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul James (academic)|title=Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global|url=https://www.academia.edu/7547819|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|pages=x|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political corruption===
{{main article|Political corruption}}
[[William Pitt the Elder]], speaking before the British [[House of Lords]], 9 January 1770, observed: "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|editor-first=William|editor-last=Safire|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed more famously by [[John Dalberg-Acton]] over a century later: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;Dalberg-Acton, John (Lord Acton). [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887]. Published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Corruption Law &amp; Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/political-corruption|website=USLegal|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title= African corruption 'on the wane'|publisher=BBC News – Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Political parties===
{{main article|Political party}}

A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Politics as an academic discipline===
[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely|page=566|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0195343342|quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0538497190|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, as well as examining the preconditions for the formation of political communities;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community|first1=Timothy|last1= Laurie|first2=Hannah|last2= Stark|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|volume=22|issue=4|pages=69–79|year= 2017|url=https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two; and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blattberg|first=Charles|title=Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies|journal=Public Affairs Quarterly|date=July 2001|volume=15|issue=3|pages=193–217|ssrn=1755117|accessdate=|issn=0887-0373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farr|first1=James|last2=Seidelman|first2=Raymond|title=Discipline and history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&amp;q=|year=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0472065127|quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political values==
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the [[Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map of the World]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]
{{main article|Political spectrum}}

Several different [[political spectrum|political spectra]] have been proposed.

===Left–right===
Political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY3b0mcDF9QC|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0140447576|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification|inequality]] while the left wing often values [[Social progress|progress]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]], [[libertarianism]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C|author=Daniel J. Levinson|title=Conservatism and Radicalism|publisher=''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality – believing it to be unethical or unnatural&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction'' (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0226062465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#"National Action" politics|National Action Party]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miis.edu/media/view/18971/original/balenouvelleresarticle.pdf|title=bale|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Authoritarian–libertarian===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|authorlink=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/150-years-of-libertarian|title=150 years of Libertarian|author=afaq|website=Anarchists Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of society. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/totalitarian?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]].

'''''Rastamouse''''' is a British [[Animation|animated]] [[stop motion]] children's TV series created by Genevieve Webster and Michael De Souza and produced by Three Stones Media/The Rastamouse Company for [[CBeebies]].

The show follows crime busting [[mouse]] [[reggae]] band Da Easy Crew, who split their time between making music and solving mysteries for Da President of Mouseland.

The first 26 [[episode]]s of the initial series were shown in the afternoon beginning 31 January 2011 on CBeebies, a UK [[BBC]] channel.&lt;ref name="cbeebies" /&gt; From 7 March 2011, the programme was repeated in the early mornings, on [[BBC2]]. The second series, comprising a further 26 episodes, started on 11 July 2011. The third series, comprising the final 26 episodes, began on CBeebies 23 March 2015.

== Characters ==

== Origins ==

Rastamouse first appeared in 2004 in the children's books ''Rastamouse and the Crucial Plan'' and ''Rastamouse Da Bag-a Bling''. A third book, ''Rastamouse and the Double-Crossin' Diva'', was published in 2005. The stories were co-written by Genevieve Webster, an author and illustrator, and Michael De Souza, a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] swimming instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbtimes.co.uk/news/schools/rastamouse_authors_speak_at_brent_library_to_mark_world_book_day_1_821508?ot=archant.PrintFriendlyPageLayout.ot|title=Rastamouse authors speak at Brent library to mark World Book Day|first=Kate|last=Ferguson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are written in [[rhyme]] and contain a [[Caribbean]] accent and some [[Jamaican Patois]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niceup.com/patois.html|title=Rasta/Patois Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pop song, "Ice Popp", was released in 2011.

[[Lenny Henry]] read two of the stories, ''The Crucial Plan'' and ''Da Bag-a Bling'', for the BBC's ''[[Jackanory Junior]]'', which was first shown in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008tt1c|title=Rastamouse - The Crucial Plan and Da Bag-a Bling, Jackanory Junior - BBC - CBeebies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethos ==

The stories emphasise the importance of solving problems through mutual understanding, love and respect, without resorting to punishment. ''Rastamouse''{{'}}s ethos is redemption and not retribution &amp;mdash; "make a bad ting good" &amp;mdash; helping wrong-doers to redeem themselves from their mistakes.

==Music==

Rastamouse and Da Easy Crew's album ''Makin' A Bad Ting Good'' was released by EMI in July 2011. It includes the single "Ice Popp".

A full second album of original music, ''Best Friends'', was released by the [[Demon Music Group]] sublabel Little Demon on 24 June 2016. The lead single of the album was "Mi Love Mi Music".

All music for the series was composed by Andrew Kingslow. The theme tune was sung by Martin "Sugar" Merchant, former singer in the rock/reggae band [[Audioweb]].

== Puppets ==

The puppets were made by Mackinnon and Saunders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mackinnonandsaunders.com/|title=Mackinnon &amp; Saunders - Animation producers and puppet makers.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who previously made the puppets for ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.

== Critical reception ==

There was early speculation in the British media that the ''Rastamouse'' cheese was an [[allusion]] to marijuana, despite actual cheese being shown in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/10/rastamouse-cbeebies-cheese-marijuana|title=Pass notes, No 2,925: Rastamouse|date=10 February 2011|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tings-is-good-for-rastamouse-the-tv-cult-hero-2212495.html|title=Tings is good for Rastamouse, the TV cult hero|date=12 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rastafarian poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] criticised the accuracy of the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] accents. There have been complaints to the BBC regarding the use of Jamaican slang, and racist overtones have been alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/02/17/rastamouse-kids-tv-show-sparks-racism-row-115875-22928642/|title=Rastamouse kids TV show sparks racism row|first=|last=Mirror.co.uk|date=17 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'', a newspaper that serves the [[British African-Caribbean community]], welcomed the show, albeit as a stereotype of Jamaican life:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=18933 The Voice reviews Rastamouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217052850/http://www.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=18933 |date=17 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a ''The Voice'' website poll showed that over 60% considered it to be a positive programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/polls/?results=rastamouse The Voice Rastamouse poll]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper reported that the creator, Michael de Souza, had been saddened by the initial media reaction to ''Rastamouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3418667/A-sad-tale-for-Rastamouse.html|title=A sad tail for Rastamouse|date=18 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ''Sun'' and [[Digital Spy]] commented that the BBC claimed that "Rastamouse is not racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3425573/Rastamouse-is-not-racist.html|title=Rastamouse ‘is not racist’|date=22 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a304956/bbc-hits-back-at-rastamouse-complaints.html|title=BBC hits back at 'Rastamouse' complaints|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper gave a differing view of Rastamouse, with the producer Greg Boardman stating that the producers "never intentionally put in innuendo or anything that isn't age-appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/feb/15/rastamouse-cbeebies|title=Rastamouse: righteous rodent or rank stereotype?|first=Michael|last=Hogan|date=15 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures provided by broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] indicate that the animated TV show received 12 complaints in 2011, though none of them was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb178/obb178.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC described ''Rastamouse'', aimed at children under six, as one of its most popular shows of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/kids-rastamouse-received-scores-complaints-2748/ |title=Kids’ "Rastamouse" received scores of complaints |first=Paul |last=Anderson |newspaper=Big Cartoon News |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707193158/http://blog.bcdb.com/kids-rastamouse-received-scores-complaints-2748/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop '''Robert Caldwell''' (7 May 1814 – 28 August 1891) was a [[missionary]] and [[linguist]], who academically established the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] family of languages.He served as Assistant Bishop of [[Tirunelveli]] from 1877.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} He was described in ''[[The Hindu]]'' as a "pioneering champion of the downtrodden" and an "avant-garde social reformer".&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://hindu.com/br/2007/11/06/stories/2007110650021500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Pioneering champion of the downtrodden | date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] has created a memorial in his honor and a postage stamp has been issued in his name.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://hindu.com/2010/02/24/stories/2010022451370200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Minister visits Bishop Caldwell's house | date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampsofindia.com/lists/brochures/2010brochure2123.jpg Robert Caldwell] Stamps of India Retrieved 8 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; a statue of Caldwell was erected in 1967 near to [[Marina Beach]], [[Chennai]], as a gift of the [[Church of South India]].

==Early life==
Robert Caldwell was born at [[Clady, County Londonderry|Clady]], then in [[County Antrim]], Ireland, on 7 May 1814 to poor [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Presbyterian]] parents. The family moved to [[Glasgow]] and there he began work at the age of nine. Mostly self-taught, he returned to Ireland aged 15, living with an older brother in [[Dublin]] while studying art between 1829 and 1833. He then returned to Glasgow, probably as a consequence of a crisis of faith, and he became active in the [[Congregational church]].{{sfnp|Frykenberg|2004|p=|ps=}}

Caldwell won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] only to find it rescinded when the authorities discovered that he had been born in Ireland. He responded by joining the [[London Missionary Society]], who sent him to the [[University of Glasgow]] for training. There Caldwell came under the influence of [[Daniel Keyte Sandford]], a professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and promoter of [[Anglicanism]] whose innovative research encouraged Caldwell's liking for comparative [[philology]] and also theology. Caldwell left university with a distinction and was [[ordain]]ed as a Congregationalist minister.{{sfnp|Frykenberg|2004|p=|ps=}}

At 24, Caldwell arrived in Madras on 8 January 1838 as a missionary of the London Missionary Society and later joined the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission]] (SPG). To further his missionary objectives, Caldwell realised that he had to be proficient in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] to [[proselytism|proselytise]] the masses and he began a systematic study of the language. He was consecrated Bishop of Tirunelveli in 1877. In 1844, Caldwell married Eliza Mault (1822–99), with whom he had seven children. She was the younger daughter of the veteran [[Travancore]] missionary, Reverend Charles Mault (1791–1858) of the London Missionary Society. For more than forty years, Eliza worked in [[(Idayankudi)]] and Tirunelveli proselytising the people, especially Tamil-speaking women.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Caldwell's ''Comparative Grammar''==
[[File:MarinaBeach RobertCaldwell.jpg|thumb|Robert Caldwell's statue at Marina Beach, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.]]
Robert Caldwell used the term ''Dravidian'' to separate the languages spoken in [[South India]] from other, more [[Sanskrit]]-affiliated languages of India. Apart from the main South Indian languages of Tamil, [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], the [[Brahui language|Brahui]] language spoken in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] also belongs to the [[Dravidian language family]]. A few more languages have been identified as such. Scholars in the 19th century prior to Caldwell considered Tamil and other South Indian languages to be rooted in Sanskrit and affiliated to the [[Indo-European language family]]. Some early critics such as [[Charles E. Gover]], author of ''The Folk Songs of South India'' disagreed with his findings.

While Caldwell's ''[[A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages]]'' was prescient in recognising that Dravidian languages constitute a distinct [[language family]], "Caldwell's primary concern was to convert the south Indians to Christianity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2004/Hinduisms.pdf |title=Hinduisms, Christian Missions, and the Tinnevelly Shanars: A Study of Colonial Missions in 19th Century India |author=Daughrity, Dyron B. |year=2005 |pages=4, 7 |publisher=University of Calgary |location=Alberta |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at times the work deliberately ventures beyond the scope of linguistics to advance that goal{{fact|date=November 2017}}.

The [[Caste system in India]] was an exploitative, violent and dehumanising ideology that served the interests of high-caste Hindus.{{cn|date=July 2017}} In keeping with his Christian beliefs, Caldwell was absolutely opposed to it and committed to the welfare of people whom he believed could be liberated from casteist oppression through evangelism. His efforts to evangelise were directed specifically towards members of the Tamil-speaking [[Chanar]] caste, who self-identified as Hindu. Caldwell took the conclusions he had arrived at with respect to the Dravidian language family's distinctive features in a radically new direction by claiming that Tamils, particularly those from the lower-castes like the Chanars, constituted a community distinct from "other Hindus".{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Caldwell  asserted that the Chanar were not merely Tamil speakers but an "indigenous Dravidian" people, distinct ethnically and, most critically for him, religiously, from their high-caste oppressors, whom he referred to as "Brahmanical Aryans" (another invention of Caldwell's - in this case "Aryan" as an ethnic signifier for foreign and "Brahmanical" to signify the "Hinduism" of the high-caste).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2004/Hinduisms.pdf |title=Hinduisms, Christian Missions, and the Tinnevelly Shanars: A Study of Colonial Missions in 19th Century India |author=Daughrity, Dyron B. |year=2005 |pages=4, 7 |publisher=University of Calgary |location=Alberta |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These wildly speculative claims, well outside the scope of linguistics, were intended "to develop a history which asserted that the indigenous Dravidians had been subdued and colonised by the Brahmanical Aryans". However, the first edition of Caldwell's grammar was "met with firm resistance" by the Chanars precisely because they "did not like the idea of being divorced from Brahmanical civilisation", the very division Caldwell was hoping to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2004/Hinduisms.pdf |title=Hinduisms, Christian Missions, and the Tinnevelly Shanars: A Study of Colonial Missions in 19th Century India |author=Daughrity, Dyron B. |year=2005 |pages=4, 7 |publisher=University of Calgary |location=Alberta |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Caldwell portrayed Chanar culture as "superior" but nonetheless "distinct" to Hindu culture in subsequent editions to further his objective of alienating them from high-caste Hindus and converting them to Christianity.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The book has been described as being on occasion "pejorative, outrageous, and somewhat paternalistic. But on the whole his studies represent a pioneering effort to understand religions completely foreign to the British mind". In the domain of Dravidian linguistics though, it remains a respected work today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2004/Hinduisms.pdf |title=Hinduisms, Christian Missions, and the Tinnevelly Shanars: A Study of Colonial Missions in 19th Century India |author=Daughrity, Dyron B. |year=2005 |pages=4, 7 |publisher=University of Calgary |location=Alberta |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological research==
While serving as Bishop of Tirunelveli (alongside Edward Sargent), Caldwell (who was not a trained archaeologist) did much original research on the history of Tirunelveli. He studied palm leaf manuscripts and [[Sangam literature]] in his search, and made several excavations, finding the foundations of ancient buildings, sepulchral urns and coins with the fish emblem of the [[Pandyan Kingdom]].{{sfnp|Kumaradoss|2007|p=157|ps=}} This work resulted in his book ''A Political and General History of the District of Tinnevely'' (1881), published by the Government of the [[Madras Presidency]].
[[File:Holy Trinity Church IdayanKudi.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Church built by missionary Robert Caldwell, situated in Idayankudi, Caldwell was a Bishop of Tirunelveli.]]

==Life's work==
Caldwell’s mission lasted more than fifty years. The publication of his research into both the languages and the history of the region, coupled with his position in both Indian and English society, gave stimulus to the revival of the [[Dravidian movement|Non-Brahmin movement]].{{sfnp|Kumaradoss|2007|p=280|ps=}}

Meanwhile, on difficult ground for evangelism, Caldwell achieved Christian conversion among the lower castes. He had adopted some of the methods of the Lutheran missionaries of earlier times, having learned German purely in order to study their practices.{{sfnp|Kumaradoss|2007|p=23|ps=}}

Caldwell the [[Tamil language]] scholar, Christian evangelist and champion of the native church,&lt;ref&gt;Kumaradoss, ''Robert Caldwell'', pp. 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt; remains today an important figure in the modern history of South India. He is still remembered there, and his statue, erected eighty years after his death, stands near the Marina Beach at Chennai.{{sfnp|Kumaradoss|2007|p=281|ps=}} The Indian historian Dr M.S.S. Pandian, Visiting Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, recently commented that Caldwell’s "contribution to both Christianity in South India and the cultural awakening of the region is unmatched during the last two hundred years".&lt;ref&gt;Dr M.S.S. Pandian, cited on back cover of Kumaradoss, ''Robert Caldwell''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commemorative postage stamp on him was issued on 7 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2010.aspx|title=Stamps - 2010|publisher=Department of Posts, Government of India|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Scots language}}

'''Scots''' is the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[Natural language|language]] [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] spoken in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Scotland]] and parts of [[Ulster]] (where the local dialect is known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CV=1&amp;NA=&amp;PO=999&amp;CN=999&amp;VL=1&amp;CM=9&amp;CL=ENG |title=List of declarations made with respect to treaty No.&amp;nbsp;148 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called '''Lowland Scots''' to distinguish it from [[Scottish Gaelic]], the [[Celtic language]] which was historically restricted to most of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], the [[Hebrides]] and [[Galloway]] after the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cranntara.scot/gaelic.htm Gaelic Language&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots language developed during the [[Middle English]] period as a distinct entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Modern Scots | author=Bergs, Alexander | journal=Languages of the World | publisher=Bow Historical Books | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLhZAAAAMAAJ | year=2001 | volume=242 | page=4|quote=Scots developed out of a mixture of Scandinavianised Northern English during the early Middle English period}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Modern Scots | author=Bergs, Alexander | journal=Languages of the World | publisher=Bow Historical Books | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLhZAAAAMAAJ | year=2001 | volume=242 | page=50|quote=Scots originated as one form of Northern Old English and quickly developed into a language in its own right up to the seventeenth century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Good or Bad Scots?: Attitudes to Optional Lexical and Grammatical Usages in Edinburgh | author=Sandred, Karl Inge | journal=ACTA Universitatis Upsaliensis | publisher=Ubsaliensis S.

As there are no universally accepted [[Language or dialect|criteria for distinguishing]] a [[language]] from a [[dialect]], scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.894"&gt;[[A. J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.894&lt;/ref&gt; Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist, they often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with [[Scottish English|Scottish Standard English]] at the other.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith-phonology"&gt;Stuart-Smith J. ''Scottish English: Phonology'' in Varieties of English: The British Isles, Kortman &amp; Upton (Eds), Mouton de Gruyter, New York 2008. p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, but it has its own distinct dialects.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.894"/&gt; Alternatively, Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct [[Germanic language]], in the way that [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is closely linked to, but distinct from, [[Danish language|Danish]].&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.894"/&gt;

A 2010 [[Scottish Government]] study of "public attitudes towards the Scots language" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) "don't really think of Scots as a language" but it also found that "the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)".&lt;ref name="Public Attitudes"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Scottish Government|title=Public Attitudes Towards the Scots Language|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/01/06105123/0|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011#2011 Census for Scotland|2011 Scottish census]], a question on Scots language ability was featured.

(2003) Language and Tradition in Ireland: Continuities and Displacements, Univ of Massachusetts Press. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===

''Scots'' is a contraction of ''Scottis'', the [[Early Scots|Older Scots]]&lt;ref name="SND Scots adj"/&gt; and northern version of late [[Old English]] ''Scottisc'' (modern English "Scottish"), which replaced the earlier [[Germanic umlaut|i-mutated]] version ''Scyttisc''.&lt;ref&gt;[dictionary.oed.com OED online], Scots, a. (n.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OED online, Scottish, a. and n.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the fifteenth century, English speech in Scotland was known as "English" (written ''Ynglis'' or ''Inglis'' at the time), whereas "Scottish" (''Scottis'') referred to [[Gaelic (language)|Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotslanguage.com/books/view/2/539/What%20is%20Scots|title=Scotslanguage.com - A Brief History of Scots|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language, albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495 the term ''Scottis'' was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.894"/&gt; and ''Erse'', meaning Irish, as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the fifteenth century, [[William Dunbar]] was using ''Erse'' to refer to Gaelic and, in the early sixteenth century, [[Gavin Douglas]] was using ''Scottis'' as a name for the Lowland vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stewart Kingdom of Scotland 1371–1603'', Caroline Bingham, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Companion to the Oxford English Dictionary'', Tom McArthur, Oxford University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called [[Scottish Gaelic]].

[[Northumbrian (Anglo-Saxon)|Northumbrian]] [[Old English]] had been established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the [[River Forth]] by the seventh century, as the region was part of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/about-scots/history-of-scots/ |title=A History of Scots to 1700 (from the Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue Vol. 12 p. xxxvi) |publisher=[[Dictionary of the Scots Language]] |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle Irish]] was the then language of the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish court]] and the common use of Old English remained largely confined to this area until the thirteenth century. 

The succeeding variety of Early northern [[Middle English]] spoken in southeastern Scotland was also known as [[Early Scots]]. It began to further diverge from the Middle English of [[Northumbria]] due to twelfth and thirteenth century immigration of [[Old Norse language|Scandinavian-influenced]] Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Scots to 1700, DOST Vol. 12 p. xliii&lt;/ref&gt; Later influences on the development of Scots came from the [[Romance language]]s via ecclesiastical and legal [[Latin]], [[Norman language|Norman French]],&lt;ref&gt;A History of Scots to 1700, pp. lxiii–lxv&lt;/ref&gt; and later Parisian French, due to the [[Auld Alliance]].

From the thirteenth century, the Early Scots language spread further into Scotland via the [[burgh]]s, which were proto-urban institutions first established by King [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. In the fourteenth century Scotland, the growth in prestige of Early Scots and the complementary decline of French, made Scots the [[prestige dialect]] of most of eastern Scotland. By the sixteenth century [[Middle Scots]] had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Scots"  in Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (Editors)(2003) ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scots''.

From 1610 to the 1690s during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] some 200,000 Scots-speaking Lowlanders settled in Ulster in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Montgomery &amp; Gregg 1997: 572"&gt;Montgomery &amp; Gregg 1997: 572&lt;/ref&gt; In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1977: 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name [[Modern Scots]] is used to describe the Scots language after 1700, when southern [[Modern English]] was generally adopted as the literary language, though Modern Scots remained the vernacular.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Geographic distribution==
In Scotland, Scots is spoken in the [[Scottish Lowlands]], the [[Northern Isles]], [[Caithness]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and [[Campbeltown]]. In Ulster (Ireland) it is spoken in the [[Counties of Ireland|Counties]] of [[County Down|Down]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Donegal|Donegal]]. Dialects include [[Insular Scots]], [[Northern Scots]], [[Central Scots]], [[Southern Scots]] and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]].

Before the [[Treaty of Union 1707]], when Scotland and England joined to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent [[sister language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scots-online.org/articles/Nostra_Vulgari_Lingua.asp |title=Nostra Vulgari Lingua: Scots as a European Language 1500–1700 |first=Dauvit |last=Horsbroch |publisher=www.scots-online.org |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a [[pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[diasystem]] with English.

The linguist [[Heinz Kloss]] considered Modern Scots a ''Halbsprache'' (half language) in terms of an [[abstand and ausbau languages]] framework&lt;ref&gt;Kloss, Heinz, ²1968, ''Die Entwicklung neuer germanischer Kultursprachen seit 1800'', Düsseldorf: Bagel. pp.70, 79&lt;/ref&gt; although today, in Scotland, most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to [[Scottish English|Scottish Standard English]]. Many speakers are either [[Diglossia|diglossic]] and/or able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] along the continuum depending on the situation in which they find themselves. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. Because standard English now generally has the role of a [[Dachsprache]], disputes often arise as to whether the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggie Mcott"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Maggie|title=The Scots Continuum and Descriptive Linguistics|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/SWE/TBI/TBIIssue2/ScotsContinuum.html|work=The Bottle Imp|publisher=Association for Scottish Literary Studies|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government now accepts Scots as a [[regional language]] and has recognised it as such under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Second Report submitted by the United Kingdom pursuant to article 25, paragraph 2 of the framework convention for the protection of national minorities |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_fcnmdocs/PDF_2nd_SR_UK_en.pdf |format= PDF |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Notwithstanding the UK government's and the Scottish Executive's obligations under part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Scottish Executive recognises and respects Scots (in all its forms) as a distinct language, and does not consider the use of Scots to be an indication of poor competence in English.}}

Evidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent – if somewhat fluid – [[Orthography|orthographic conventions]] and in its former use as the language of the original [[Parliament of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519008 Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1560], written in Scots and still part of British Law&lt;/ref&gt; Because Scotland retained distinct political, legal, and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English.

===Language shift===

From the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing [[Standard English]] of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Scots'' in Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (Editors)(2003) ''The ''Edinburgh Companion to Scots''.

When an [[William Flower (officer of arms)|English herald]] spoke to [[Mary of Guise]] and her councillors in 1560, at first they spoke in the "Scottyshe toung", but then he "not well understanding", they continued in her native French.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 322.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI and I|King James VI]], who in 1603 became [[James I of England]], observed in his work ''The Reulis and Cautelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis Prose'' that "For albeit sindrie has written of it in Engish, quhilk is lykest to our language ..." however, with the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.&lt;ref name="Scots' 2003 p. 11"&gt;"A Brief History of Scots'' in Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (Editors)(2003) ''The ''Edinburgh Companion to Scots''.

After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles (1995) ''A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century'', Edinburgh, John Donald, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Many leading Scots of the period, such as [[David Hume]], defined themselves as [[North Britain|Northern British]] rather than Scottish.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles (1995) ''A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century'', Edinburgh, John Donald, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed union. Nevertheless, Scots was still spoken across a wide range of domains until the end of the eighteenth century,&lt;ref name="Scots' 2003 p. 11"/&gt; illustrated for example, in the summary by [[Frederick Albert Pottle|Frederick Pottle]], [[James Boswell]]'s twentieth-century biographer, concerning James's view of the speech habits of his father [[Alexander Boswell (judge)|Alexander Boswell]], a judge of the [[College of Justice|Supreme Courts]] of Scotland:

{{quote|He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar.}}

Others did however scorn Scots, such as intellectuals from the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] David Hume and [[Adam Smith]], who went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scuilwab.org.uk/assets/TheHistoryOScots-1.pdf|title=Scuilwab, p.3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English [[elocution]].

Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. From such eighteenth-century activities grew [[Scottish English|Scottish Standard English]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Scots'' in Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (Editors)(2003) ''The ''Edinburgh Companion to Scots''.

[[File:AU Burns Canberra.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Robert Burns]] in [[Canberra, Australia]]]]

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a [[literary language]] was revived by several prominent Scotsmen such as [[Robert Burns]]. Such writers established a new cross-dialect literary norm.

During the first half of the twentieth century, knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary norms waned, and currently there is no institutionalised standard literary form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagle |first=Andy |year=2006 |title= Aw Ae Wey – Written Scots in Scotland and Ulster |url= http://www.scots-online.org/articles/contents/AwAeWey.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, the Scottish Education Department's [[language policy]] was that Scots had no value: "it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture".&lt;ref&gt;Primary education: a report of the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland, Scottish Education Department 1946, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Students reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete.

===Language revitalisation===
[[File:William Wye Smith-The New Testament in Braid Scots.pdf|thumb|William Wye Smith's ''The [[New Testament]] in Braid Scots''.]]
Recently, attitudes have somewhat changed, and the status of the language has been raised in schools in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-31453253 |title=Scots language being revived in schools |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scots is now included in the new national school [[Curriculum for Excellence|curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/knowledgeoflanguage/scots/scotsandliteracy/curriculum/index.asp |title=Knowledge of Language: Scots: Scots and Curriculum for Excellence |publisher=[[Education Scotland]] |accessdate=18 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014173218/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/knowledgeoflanguage/scots/scotsandliteracy/curriculum/index.asp|archivedate=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in Scotland's schools there had been little education taking place through the [[Medium of instruction|medium]] of Scots, although it may have been covered superficially in English lessons, which could entail reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used was often Standard English disguised as Scots, which caused upset among proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/exposed-to-ridicule-1-512738 |title=Exposed to ridicule |work=The Scotsman |date=7 February 2004 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is, "Write a poem in Scots.

The use of Scots in the media is scant and is usually reserved for niches where local dialect is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, [[Burns supper|Burns Night]], or representations of traditions and times gone by. Serious use for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc., rarely occurs in Scots, although the [[Scottish Parliament]] website has offered some information in it.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/help/79056.aspx |title=The Scottish Parliament: – Languages – Scots |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of speakers==
[[File:Scots speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census in Scotland aged 3 and above who stated that they can speak Scots.]]
[[File:Ulster-Scots speakers in the 2011 census in Northern Ireland.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census in Northern Ireland aged 3 and above who stated that they can speak Ulster-Scots.]]
It has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question "Do you speak Scots?" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK National Census]]. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the [[General Register Office for Scotland]],&lt;ref name=Mate&gt;[Iain Máté] (1996) Scots Language. A Report on the Scots Language Research carried out by the General Register Office for Scotland in 1996, Edinburgh: General Register Office (Scotland).&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there were around 1.5 million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding "Yes" to the question "Can you speak the Scots language?", but only 17% responding "Aye" to the question "Can you speak Scots?".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} (It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative.) The [[University of Aberdeen]] Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7&amp;nbsp;million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Murdoch, Language Politics in Scotland (AUSLQ, 1995), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRO questions, as freely acknowledged by those who set them, were not as detailed and as systematic as the [[University of Aberdeen]] ones, and only included reared speakers, not those who had learned the language. Part of the difference resulted from the central question posed by surveys: "Do you speak Scots?". In the Aberdeen University study, the question was augmented with the further clause "...&amp;nbsp;or a dialect of Scots such as Border etc.", which resulted in greater recognition from respondents. The GRO concluded that there simply was not enough linguistic self-awareness amongst the Scottish populace, with people still thinking of themselves as speaking badly pronounced, grammatically inferior English rather than Scots, for an accurate census to be taken. The GRO research concluded that "[a] more precise estimate of genuine Scots language ability would require a more in-depth interview survey and may involve asking various questions about the language used in different situations. Such an approach would be inappropriate for a Census." Thus, although it was acknowledged that the "inclusion of such a Census question would undoubtedly raise the profile of Scots", no question about Scots was, in the end, included in the 2001 Census.&lt;ref name=Stuart-Smith&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Handbook of Varieties of English|editor=Bernd Kortmann and Edgar W.

==Literature==
{{Main|Scots-language literature}}
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Christine speaking Shetlandic.webm|thumb|[[Wikitongues]] - Scottish poet [[Christine De Luca]] speaking the Shetlandic variety of Scots]]
Among the earliest Scots literature is [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour's]] ''Brus'' (fourteenth century), [[Wyntoun]]'s ''Cronykil'' and [[Blind Harry]]'s ''[[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace|The Wallace]]'' (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based on the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the [[University of St Andrews]] was produced by writers such as [[Robert Henryson]], [[William Dunbar]], [[Gavin Douglas]] and [[David Lyndsay]]. ''[[The Complaynt of Scotland]]'' was an early printed work in Scots. The ''[[Eneados]]'' is a [[Middle Scots]] translation of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', completed by Gavin Douglas in 1513.

After the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the [[Border ballads|borders]] and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were [[Robert Sempill]], [[Robert Sempill the younger]], [[Francis Sempill]], Lady Wardlaw and Lady [[Grizel Baillie]].

In the eighteenth century, writers such as [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Robert Burns]], [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]], [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Walter Scott]] continued to use Scots – Burns's "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is in Scots, for example. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. Other well-known authors like [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], William Alexander, [[George MacDonald]], [[J. M. Barrie]] and other members of the [[Kailyard school]] like [[Ian Maclaren]] also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.

In the [[Victorian era]] popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.&lt;ref&gt;William Donaldson, ''The Language of the People: Scots Prose from the Victorian Revival'', Aberdeen University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century, a [[Scottish Renaissance|renaissance]] in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] whose benchmark poem "[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]" (1926) did much to demonstrate the power of Scots as a modern idiom. Other contemporaries were [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]], [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]], [[Sidney Goodsir Smith]], [[Robert Garioch]], [[Edith Anne Robertson]] and [[Robert McLellan]]. The revival extended to verse and other literature.

In 1955 three [[Ayrshire]] men – Sandy MacMillan, an English teacher at [[Ayr Academy]]; Thomas Limond, noted town Chamberlain of [[Ayr]]; and A.L. (Ross) Taylor, Rector of Cumnock Academy &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32; collaborated to write ''Bairnsangs'' (Child Songs),&lt;ref&gt;Bairnsangs {{ISBN|978-0-907526-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of children's [[nursery rhyme]]s and poems in Scots. The book contains a five-page glossary of contemporary Scots words and their pronunciations.

[[Alexander Gray (poet)|Alexander Gray]]'s translations into Scots constitute the greater part of his work, and are the main basis for his reputation.

In 1983 [[William Laughton Lorimer]]'s translation of the [[New Testament]] from the original Greek was published.

Highly anglicised Scots is sometimes used in contemporary fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' by [[Irvine Welsh]] (later made into a [[Trainspotting (film)|motion picture of the same name]]).

''[[But'n'Ben A-Go-Go]]'' by [[Matthew Fitt]] is a [[cyberpunk]] novel written entirely in what Wir Ain Leid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Eagle |url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar |title=Wir Ain Leed – An introduction to Modern Scots |publisher=Scots-online.org |date=26 July 2005 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Our Own Language) calls "General Scots". Like all cyberpunk work, it contains imaginative [[neologism]]s.

The ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' has been translated into Scots by [[Rab Wilson]] (published in 2004). Alexander Hutchison has translated the poetry of [[Catullus]] into Scots, and in the 1980s, [[Liz Lochhead]] produced a Scots translation of ''[[Tartuffe]]'' by [[Molière]]. [[J. K. Annand]] translated poetry and fiction from German and medieval Latin into Scots.

The strip cartoons ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' and ''[[The Broons]]'' in the ''[[Sunday Post]]'' use some Scots.

==Orthography==
{{Further|Early Scots|Middle Scots|Modern Scots}}
The [[orthography]] of [[Early Scots]] had become more or less standardised&lt;ref&gt;Agutter, Alex (1987) "A taxonomy of Older Scots orthography" in Caroline Macafee and Iseabail Macleod eds. The Nuttis Schell: Essays on the Scots Language Presented to A. J. Aitken, Aberdeen University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; by the middle to late sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, Robert McColl (2005) Language, Nation and Power An Introduction, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke. pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603 the [[Standard English]] of England came to have an increasing influence on the spelling of Scots&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, James (1926) The Dialects of Central Scotland, Oxford University Press. p.194&lt;/ref&gt; through the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England. After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 the emerging [[Scottish English|Scottish form of Standard English]] replaced Scots for most formal writing in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Scots' 2003 p. 11"/&gt;

The eighteenth-century Scots revival saw the introduction of a new [[literary language]] descended from the old court Scots, but with an orthography that had abandoned some of the more distinctive old Scots spellings&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, Graham (1980) The Language of Walter Scott. A Study of his Scottish and Period Language, London: Deutsch. p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted many standard English spellings. Despite the updated spelling, however, the rhymes make it clear that a Scots pronunciation was intended.&lt;ref name="David D. Murison 1976"&gt;William Grant and David D. Murison (eds) The ''Scottish National Dictionary'' (SND) (1929–1976), The Scottish National Dictionary Association, vol. I Edinburgh, p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; These writings also introduced what came to be known as the [[apologetic apostrophe]],&lt;ref&gt;William Grant and David D. Murison (eds) The ''Scottish National Dictionary'' (SND) (1929–1976), The Scottish National Dictionary Association, vol. I Edinburgh, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; generally occurring where a [[consonant]] exists in the Standard English [[cognate]]. This Written Scots drew not only on the vernacular but also on the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]] and was also heavily influenced by the norms and conventions of [[Augustan literature|Augustan English poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. McClure in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this written Scots looked very similar to contemporary Standard English, suggesting a somewhat modified version of that, rather than a distinct speech form with a phonological system which had been developing independently for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, J. Derrick (1985) "The debate on Scots orthography" in Manfred Görlach ed. Focus on: Scotland, Amsterdam: Benjamins, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; This modern literary dialect, ‘Scots of the book' or Standard Scots&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Albert D. (1952) “Fergusson’s Language: Braid Scots Then and Now” in Smith, Syndney Goodsir ed. Robert Fergusson 1750–1774, Edinburgh: Nelson, p. 123–124, 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mairi Robinson (editor-in-chief), ''The Concise Scots Dictionary'', Aberdeen University Press, 1985 p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; once again gave Scots an orthography of its own, lacking neither "authority nor author."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, R.L. (1905) The Works of R.L. Stevenson Vol. 8, “Underwoods”, London: Heinemann, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This literary language used throughout Lowland Scotland and Ulster,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Loreto (1989) The Language of Irish Literature, London: MacMillan, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; embodied by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, [[Charles Murray (poet)|Charles Murray]], [[David Herbison]], James Orr, [[James Hogg]] and [[William Laidlaw]] among others, is well described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors developed dialect writing, preferring to represent their own speech in a more phonological manner rather than following the pan-dialect conventions of modern literary Scots,&lt;ref name="David D. Murison 1976"/&gt; especially for the northern&lt;ref&gt;McClure, J. Derrick (2002). Doric: The Dialect of North–East Scotland. Amsterdam: Benjamins, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and insular dialects of Scots.

During the twentieth century a number of proposals for spelling reform were presented. Commenting on this, John Corbett (2003: 260) writes that "devising a normative orthography for Scots has been one of the greatest linguistic hobbies of the past century." Most proposals entailed regularising the use of established eighteenth and nineteenth century conventions, in particular the avoidance of the [[apologetic apostrophe]] which supposedly represented "missing" English letters. Such letters were never actually missing in Scots. For example, in the fourteenth century, [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] spelt the Scots [[cognate]] of 'taken' as ''tane''. Because there has been no ''k'' in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe seems pointless. The current spelling is usually ''taen''.

Through the twentieth century, with the decline of spoken Scots and knowledge of the literary tradition, phonetic (often humorous) representations became more common.

===Sample text of Modern Scots===

From ''The New Testament in Scots'' (William Laughton Lorimer 1885–1967)
Matthew:1:18ff

:This is the storie o the birth o Jesus Christ. His mither Mary wis trystit til Joseph, but afore they war mairriet she wis fund tae be wi bairn bi the Halie Spírit. Her husband Joseph, honest man, hed nae mind tae affront her afore the warld an wis for brakkin aff their tryst hidlinweys; an sae he wis een ettlin tae dae, whan an angel o the Lord kythed til him in a draim an said til him, "Joseph, son o Dauvit, be nane feared tae tak Mary your trystit wife intil your hame; the bairn she is cairrein is o the Halie Spírit. She will beir a son, an the name ye ar tae gíe him is Jesus, for he will sauf his fowk frae their sins."

:Aa this happent at the wurd spokken bi the Lord throu the Prophet micht be fulfilled: Behaud, the virgin wil bouk an beir a son, an they will caa his name Immanuel – that is, "God wi us".

:Whan he hed waukit frae his sleep, Joseph did as the angel hed bidden him, an tuik his trystit wife hame wi him. But he bedditna wi her or she buir a son; an he caa’d the bairn Jesus.

==Grammar==
{{See also|Modern Scots#Grammar|label 1=Modern Scots grammar}}

Modern Scots follows the [[subject–verb–object]] sentence structure as does [[Standard English]]. However, the word order ''He turnt oot the licht'' to 'He turned the light out' and ''Gie's it'' (''Give us it'') to 'Give it to me' may be preferred.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.897"&gt;A.J. Aitken in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.897&lt;/ref&gt;

The indefinite [[Article (grammar)|article]] ''a'' may be used before both consonants and vowels. The definite article ''the'' is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades and occupations, sciences and academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a [[possessive pronoun]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Scots includes some strong [[plural]]s such as ''ee''/''een'' (eye/eyes), ''cauf''/''caur'' (calf/calves), ''horse''/''horse'' (horse/horses), ''cou''/''kye'' (cow/cows) and ''shae''/''shuin'' (shoe/shoes) that survived from [[Old English]] into Modern Scots but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English – ''ox''/''oxen'' and ''child''/''children'' being exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"&gt;A.J. Aitken in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.896&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noun]]s of measure and quantity remain unchanged in the plural.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[relative pronoun]] is ''that'' for all persons and numbers, but may be elided.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.102&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Scots also has a third adjective/adverb ''this''-''that''-''yon''/''yonder'' (''thon''/''thonder'') indicating something at some distance.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt; ''Thir'' and ''thae'' are the plurals of ''this'' and ''that'' respectively.

The [[present tense]] of [[verb]]s adheres to the [[Northern subject rule]] whereby verbs end in -''s'' in all persons and numbers except when a single personal pronoun is next to the verb.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Certain verbs are often used progressively&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt; and verbs of motion may be dropped before an adverb or adverbial phrase of motion.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.897"/&gt;

Many verbs have [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] or [[Irregular verb|irregular]] forms which are distinctive from Standard English.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The regular past form of the [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] or [[Regular verb|regular]] verbs is ''-it'', ''-t'' or ''-ed'', according to the preceding consonant or vowel.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992. p.896"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] ''in'' are now usually {{IPA|/ən/}}&lt;ref&gt;Beal J. ''Syntax and Morphology'' in Jones C. (ed) The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language, Edinburgh,University of Edinburgh Press. p.356&lt;/ref&gt; but may still be differentiated {{IPA|/ən/}} and {{IPA|/in/}} in Southern Scots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/INTRO/intro2.php?num=22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121171949/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/INTRO/intro2.php?num=22 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 January 2012 |title=SND Introduction - Dialect Districts. p.xxxi |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, {{IPA|/ən/}} and {{IPA|/ɪn/}} North Northern Scots.

The [[Negation (linguistics)|negative particle]] is ''na'', sometimes spelled ''nae'', e.g. ''canna'' (can't), ''daurna'' (daren't), ''michtna'' (mightn't).&lt;ref name="Grant, William 1921 p.115"&gt;Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) ''Manual of Modern Scots''. Cambridge, University Press. p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adverb]]s usually take the same form as the verb root or [[adjective]] especially after verbs. ''Haein a real guid day'' (Having a really good day). ''She's awfu fauchelt'' (She's awfully tired).

[[File:Scuttler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Scuttler arrested in 1890]]

'''Scuttlers''' were members of neighbourhood-based youth gangs (known as scuttling gangs) formed in [[working class]] areas of [[Manchester]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], and the surrounding townships during the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. It is possible to draw parallels with the London street gangs of the 1890s, whose behaviour was labelled [[hooliganism]]. The social commentator [[Alexander Devine]] attributed the gang culture to lack of parental control, lack of discipline in schools, "base literature" and the monotony of life in Manchester's slums.{{sfnp|Davies|2008|p=|ps=}}

Gangs were formed throughout the [[slum]]s of central Manchester, in the townships of [[Bradford, Manchester|Bradford]], [[Gorton]] and [[Openshaw]] to the east and in Salford, to the west of the city. Gang conflicts erupted in Manchester in the early 1870s and went on sporadically for thirty years, declining in frequency and severity by the late 1890s.{{r|Davies1998}}

==Dress==
Scuttlers distinguished themselves from other young men in working-class neighbourhoods by their distinctive clothing. They generally wore a uniform of brass-tipped pointed [[Clog (British)|clogs]], [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottomed trousers]], cut like a sailor's ("bells" that measured fourteen inches round the knee and twenty-one inches round the foot) and "flashy" silk scarves. Their hair was cut short at the back and sides, but they grew long fringes, known as "donkey fringes", that were longer on the left side and plastered down on the forehead over the left eye. Peaked caps were also worn tilted to the left to display the fringe.{{r|Davies1998}} The scuttlers' girlfriends also had a distinctive style of dress consisting of clogs, shawl, and a vertically striped skirt.{{sfnp|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=289|ps=}}

==Clashes==
{{quote|A scuttler is a lad, usually between the ages of 14 and 18, or even 19, and scuttling consists of the fighting of two opposed bands of youths, who are armed with various weapons.|
[[Alexander Devine]], ''Scuttlers and Scuttling: Their Prevention and Cure.'' (Manchester, 1890)}}
Scuttling gangs were territorial fighting gangs, as reflected in their names; the Bengal Tigers came from the cluster of streets and courts off Bengal Street in [[Ancoats]]. Most gangs took their names from a local thoroughfare, such as Holland Street, [[Miles Platting]], or Hope Street, Salford.{{sfnp|Davies|2008|p=|ps=}}
Gang members fought with a variety of weapons, but they all carried knives and wore heavy buckled belts, often decorated with pictures such as serpents, scorpions, hearts pierced with arrows or women's names. The thick leather belts were their most prized possessions and were wrapped tightly around the wrist at the onset of a "scuttle", so that the buckle could be used to strike at opponents. The use of knives and belts was designed to maim and disfigure rather than to kill.{{r|Davies1998}}

Some of the clashes between rival gangs involved large numbers; the ''Gorton Reporter'' described one such instance in May 1879 as involving more than 500 people.{{sfnp|James|2008|p=57|ps=}} Scuttling reached a peak in 1890–91; it was said that by 1890 more youths were held in [[Manchester (HM Prison)|Strangeways Prison]] for scuttling than for any other offence.{{sfnp|Davies|2008|p=|ps=}}

==Demise==
By the turn of the century the gangs had all but died out owing to some of the worst slums having been cleared, the setting up of Working Lads' Clubs (such as [[Salford Lads' Club]]) to engage the working youths in more peaceful
activities, the spread of [[street football]] and the advent of the cinema.{{sfnp|Davies|2008|p=|ps=}}

One initiative to provide an alternative to gang warfare resulted in the formation of St&amp;nbsp;Marks (West Gorton) Football Club, which later became [[Manchester City FC]].{{sfnp|James|2008|p=58|ps=}} In 1997 the Manchester historian Gary James highlighted that scuttling was the number one unifying activity of young men, and that the creation of St&amp;nbsp;Mark's Football Club was a very serious attempt at diverting the young men of West Gorton into more worthwhile activities. Anna Connell, perceived by many as the founder of St&amp;nbsp;Mark's FC, also helped create men's meetings, a library, and other society improving facilities and clubs.{{sfnp|James|2002|pp=9–12|ps=}}

{{Sociology}}
The '''sociology of culture''', and the related cultural sociology, concerns the systematic analysis of [[culture]], usually understood as the ensemble of symbolic codes used by a members of a society, as it is manifested in the society. For [[Georg Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Culture in the sociological field is analyzed as the ways of thinking and describing, acting, and the material objects that together shape a group of people's way of life.

Contemporary sociologists' approach to culture is often divided between a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not interchangeable.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sociology of culture'' is an older concept, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. By way of contrast, [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]] introduced the term ''cultural sociology'', an approach that sees all, or most, [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] as inherently cultural at some level.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology|publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu|accessdate=2014-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|archivedate=2015-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a leading proponent of the "[[Strong programme|strong program]]" in cultural sociology, Alexander argues: "To believe in the possibility of cultural sociology is to subscribe to the idea that every action, no matter how instrumental, reflexive, or coerced [compared to] its external environment, is embedded to some extent in a horizon of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology By Jeffrey C. Alexander https://books.google.com/books?id=CIA3AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=csNoAH4xzN&amp;dq=%22cultural%20turn%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of analysis, sociology of culture often attempts to explain some discretely cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a component of explanations of social phenomena.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|author1=Griswold, W.|author2=Carroll, C.|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412990547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the field of [[cultural studies]], cultural sociology does not reduce all human matters to a problem of cultural encoding and decoding. For instance, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s cultural sociology has a "clear recognition of the social and the economic as categories which are interlinked with, but not reducible to, the cultural."&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." The Sociological Review 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar, Germany]], where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. In the beginning of the cultural turn, sociologists tended to use qualitative methods and hermeneutic approaches to research, focusing on meanings, words, artifacts and symbols. "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including historically quantitative and model-based subfields, such as [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]].

===Early researchers===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology, as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]], and [[anthropology]] where researchers pioneered [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. 
Part of the legacy of the early development of the field is still felt in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative) in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities) and substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Karl Marx}}
As a major contributor to [[conflict theory]], Marx argued that culture served to justify inequality. The ruling class, or the [[bourgeoisie]], produce a culture that promotes their interests, while repressing the interests of the [[proletariat]]. 
His most famous line to this effect is that "Religion is the [[opium of the people]]".
Marx believed that the "engine of history" was the struggle between groups of people with diverging economic interests and thus the economy determined the cultural [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of [[values]] and [[ideologies]]. For this reason, Marx is a considered a ''[[materialist]]'' as he believes that the economic (material) produces the cultural (ideal), which "stands [[Hegel]] on his head,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/calhoun.jackson.theory/papers/A--MarxGeneral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who argued the ideal produced the material.

====Émile Durkheim====
{{Main|Émile Durkheim}}
Durkheim held the belief that culture has many relationships to society which include:
* ''Logical'' – Power over individuals belongs to certain cultural categories, and beliefs such as in God.
* ''Functional –'' Certain rites and myths create and build up social order by having more people create strong beliefs. The greater the number of people who believe strongly in these myths more will the social order be strengthened.
* ''Historical –'' Culture had its origins in society, and from those experiences came evolution into things such as classification systems.

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Max Weber}}
Weber innovated the idea of a [[status group]] as a certain type of subculture. Status groups are based on things such as: race, ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, gender, sexual preference, etc. These groups live a certain lifestyle based on different values and norms. They are a culture within a culture, hence the label subculture. Weber also purported the idea that people were motivated by their material and ideal interests, which include things such as preventing one from going to hell. Weber also explains that people use symbols to express their spirituality, that symbols are used to express the spiritual side of real events, and that ideal interests are derived from symbols.

====Georg Simmel====
{{Main|Georg Simmel}}
For Simmel, culture refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel presented his analyses within a context of "form" and "content". Sociological concept and analysis can be viewed.

== The elements of a culture== 
As no two cultures are exactly alike they do all have common characteristics.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocs.cnyric.org/webpages/phyland/global_10.cfm?subpage=19595&lt;/ref&gt;

A culture contains:

'''1. Social Organization:''' Structured by organizing its members into smaller numbers to meet the cultures specific requirements. Social classes ranked in order of importance (status) based on the cultures core values. In example: money, job, education, family, etc. 

'''2. Customs and Traditions:''' Rules of behavior enforced by the cultures ideas of right and wrong such as is customs, traditions, rules, or written laws.

'''3. Symbols:''' Any thing that carries particular meaning recognized by people who share the same culture.&lt;ref name=gerber&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gerber, John J., and Linda M. Macionis |title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=59–65|edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. [[Social norm|Norms]]:''' Rules and expectations by which a society guides the behavior of its members. The two types of norms are mores and folkways. '''[[Mores]]''' are norms that are widely observed and have a great moral significance. '''Folkways''' are norms for routine, casual interaction.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''5. Religion:''' The answers to their basic meanings of life and values.

'''6. Language:''' A system of symbols that allows people to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''7. Arts and Literature:''' Products of human imagination made into art, music, literature, stories, and dance.

'''8. Forms of Government:''' How the culture distributes power. Who keeps the order within the society, who protects them from danger, and who provides for their needs. Can fall into terms such as [[Democracy]], [[Republic]], or [[Dictatorship]].

'''9. Economic Systems:''' What to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. How people use their limited resources to satisfy their wants and needs. Can fall into the terms Traditional Economy, [[Market Economy]], [[Command Economy]], [[Mixed Economy]].

'''10. Artifacts:''' Distinct material objects, such as architecture, technologies, and artistic creations.

'''11.  Social institutions:''' Patterns of organization and relationships regarding governance, production, socializing, education, knowledge creation, arts, and relating to other cultures.

 
==Anthropology==
In an anthropological sense, culture is society based on the values and ideas without influence of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The cultural system is the cognitive and symbolic matrix for the central values system|sign=[[Talcott Parsons]]|source=}}

Culture is like the shell of a lobster. Human nature is the organism living inside of that shell. The shell, culture, identifies the organism, or human nature. Culture is what sets human nature apart, and helps direct the life of human nature.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] lay claim to the establishment of modern uses of the culture concept as defined by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in the mid-19th century.

===Bronisław Malinowski===
{{Main|Bronisław Malinowski}}
Malinowski collected data from the [[Trobriand Islands]]. Descent groups across the island claim parts of the land, and to back up those claims, they tell myths of how an ancestress started a clan and how the clan descends from that ancestress. Malinowski's observations followed the research of that found by Durkheim.

===Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown===
{{Main|Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown}}
Radcliffe-Brown put himself in the culture of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman Islanders]]. His research showed that group solidification among the islanders is based on music and kinship, and the rituals that involve the use of those activities. In the words of Radcliffe-Brown, "Ritual fortifies Society".

===Marcel Mauss===
{{Main|Marcel Mauss}}
Marcel Mauss made many comparative studies on religion, magic, law and morality of occidental and non-occidental societies, and developed the concept of [[total social fact]], and argued that the reciprocity is the universal logic of the cultural interaction.

===Claude Lévi-Strauss===
{{Main|Claude Lévi-Strauss}}
Lévi-Strauss, based, at the same time, on the sociological and anthropological [[positivism]] of Durkheim, Mauss, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, on the economic and sociological [[marxism]], on [[freudian]] and [[Gestalt psychology]] and on [[structural linguistics]] of Saussure and Jakobson, realized great studies on areas myth, kinship, religion, ritual, symbolism, magic, [[ideology]] (souvage pensée), knowledge, art and aesthetics, applying the [[methodological structuralism]] on his investigations. He searched the universal principals of human thought as a form of explaining social behaviors and structures.

==Major areas of research==

===Theoretical constructs in Bourdieu's sociology of culture===
French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s influential model of society and social relations has its roots in [[Marxist theorists|Marxist theories]] of [[Marxian class theory|class]] and [[Social conflict theory|conflict]]. Bourdieu characterizes social relations in the context of what he calls the ''[[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]'', defined as a competitive system of social relations functioning according to its own specific logic or rules. The ''field'' is the site of struggle for power between the dominant and subordinate classes. It is within the ''field'' that [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimacy]]—a key aspect defining the dominant class—is conferred or withdrawn.

Bourdieu's theory of practice is practical rather than [[Discursive psychology|discursive]], embodied as well as cognitive and durable though adaptive. A valid concern that sets the agenda in Bourdieu's [[Practice theory|theory of practice]] is how action follows regular statistical patterns without the product of accordance to rules, norms and/or conscious intention. To explain this concern, Bourdieu explains [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and [[field (Bourdieu)|field]]. Habitus explains the mutually penetrating realities of individual subjectivity and societal objectivity after the function of social construction. It is employed to transcend the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] dichotomy.

===Cultural change===
{{Further|Trans-cultural diffusion}}
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. [[Resistance (psychoanalysis)|Resistance]] can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.

[[Culture change|Cultural change]] can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures.

Several understandings of how cultures change come from anthropology. For instance, in diffusion theory, the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] but has diffused to numerous cultures. Its original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[New Age religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces. A variant of the diffusion theory, [[stimulus diffusion]], refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention in another.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many [[Native American Indians]]. Related processes on an individual level are [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change. Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals – which, for certain elements of cultural change, is true – but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture. The author presents a [[sociological perspective]] to address this conflict.

Sociology suggests an alternative to both the view that it has always been an unsatisfying way  at one extreme and the sociological individual genius view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations. We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p.&amp;nbsp;53)
In short, Griswold argues that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture. The logic is a bit circular, but illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, "there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was"). Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society. This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue. Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural). Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend). Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning. This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do. Cultural change, on the other hand, is a matter that can be questioned and researched, as Griswold does.

===Culture theory===
[[Culture theory]], developed in the 1980s and 1990s, sees audiences as playing an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media. One strand of research focuses on the audiences and how they interact with media; the other strand of research focuses on those who produce the media, particularly the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|title=The Role and Influence of Mass Media|last=|first=|date=|website=Cliffs Notes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821005211/http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-mediated communication as culture===
{{Main|Computer-mediated communication}}

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the process of sending messages—primarily, but not limited to text messages—through the direct use by participants of computers and communication networks. By restricting the definition to the direct use of computers in the communication process, you have to get rid of the communication technologies that rely upon computers for switching technology (such as telephony or compressed video), but do not require the users to interact directly with the computer system via a keyboard or similar computer interface. To be mediated by computers in the sense of this project, the communication must be done by participants fully aware of their interaction with the computer technology in the process of creating and delivering messages. Given the current state of computer communications and networks, this limits CMC to primarily text-based messaging, while leaving the possibility of incorporating sound, graphics, and video images as the technology becomes more sophisticated.

===Cultural institutions===
{{Main|Cultural Institutions Studies}}
Cultural activities are institutionalised; the focus on institutional settings leads to the investigation "of activities in the cultural sector, conceived as historically evolved societal forms of organising the conception, production, distribution, propagation, interpretation, reception, conservation and maintenance of specific cultural goods".&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Tasos (2004): Kulturbetriebslehre. Begründung einer Inter-Disziplin. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Institutions Studies is therefore a specific approach within the sociology of culture.

'''''The Bishoprick Garland''''' is a book compiled by [[Cuthbert Sharp]] which gives historical details of people, places and events from the [[Bishopric of Durham]], and was published in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bishoprick Garland |url=http://gredos.usal.es/jspui/bitstream/10366/82881/2/SC_CuthbertSharp_ed_Bishoprick_1834.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
'''''The Bishoprick Garland''''' – (full title – "The Bishoprick Garland, Or a collection of Legends, Songs, Ballads, &amp;c. Belonging to the County of Durham. [By Sir Cuthbert Sharpe]". London: Nichols, and Baldwin &amp; Cradock. 1834) is a book of approximately 84 pages, giving historical details of people, places, songs, poems and writers pertaining to the North East of England, and in particular the [[County Durham|County of Durham]] or more correctly termed [[Durham, England#Prince Bishops|Bishoprick of Durham]] (using an obsolete spelling of bishopric).

It contains [[Geordie]] [[folk song]]s (or extracts from) and contains over 150 such song/poem lyric extracts on over 80 pages, and was published in 1834. It was edited by (Sir) [[Cuthbert Sharp]].

== Bibliographical details ==
It is, as the title suggests (this meaning of garland being a collection of short literary pieces, such as ballads or poems; miscellany or anthology), a collection of historical facts from the area of the [[Durham, England#Prince Bishops|Bishopric of Durham]]. There are a surprising large number of entries and biographies, but disappointingly most of the songs/poetry are in the form of extracts, and some biographies are quite short.

The front cover of the book is thus :-

THE&lt;br /&gt;
BISHOPRICK GARLAND, &lt;br /&gt;
OR A COLLECTION OF&lt;br /&gt;
Legends, Songs, Ballads, &amp;c. &lt;br /&gt;
BELONGING TO&lt;br /&gt;
THE COUNTY OF DURHAM. &lt;br /&gt;
[By Sir Cuthbert Sharpe] &lt;br /&gt;
"That old and antique song we heard last night, &lt;br /&gt;
Methought, it did relieve my passion much, &lt;br /&gt;
More than light airs, and recollected terms, &lt;br /&gt;
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times." &lt;br /&gt;
Twelfth Night. &lt;br /&gt;
LONDON: &lt;br /&gt;
NICHOLS, AND BALDWIN &amp; CRADOCK. &lt;br /&gt;
1834

'''''The Diary of a Nobody''''' is an English comic novel written by the brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] and [[Weedon Grossmith]], with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1888–89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The ''Diary'' records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, [[Charles Pooter]], his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.

Before their collaboration on the ''Diary'', the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano [[sketch comedy|sketch]] entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The ''Diary'' was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the ''Diary'' were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.

Although its initial public reception was muted, the ''Diary'' came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The ''Diary'' has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including [[Ken Russell]]'s "silent film" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.

==Authorship and origin==
[[File:Weedon-and-George-Grossmith.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Grossmith|George]] (right) and [[Weedon Grossmith]]|alt=Two men in suits. There is a family resemblance.]]
''The Diary of a Nobody'' was the work of [[George Grossmith]] and his brother [[Weedon Grossmith]], the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor.&lt;ref name= JH/&gt; The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at [[Haverstock|Haverstock Hill]]. This included a 20-minute [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] version of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which George played the title role; Weedon was [[Ophelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Grossmith|first= George|title= A Society Clown: Reminiscences.

By 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano [[sketch comedy|sketch]] entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, separately, by [[W. S. Gilbert]], in performances of their one-act comic opera ''[[Trial by Jury]]''. Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s long-running comic operas until ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which closed in 1889.&lt;ref name= JH/&gt; While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material.  He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day,&lt;ref name= ODNB&gt;{{cite web|last= Joseph|first= Tony|title= Grossmith, George|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33590?docPos=1|work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=Online |accessdate= 7 July 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Shepherd|first= Marc|url= http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/ms_berger.htm|title=  The Grossmith Legacy|publisher=  Gilbert and Sullivan Discography|date= 2 January 2004|accessdate= 22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first= Leon|title= Grossmith, George|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/48859?q=George+Grossmith&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|accessdate= 7 July 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]].&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt; In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.&lt;ref name= JH&gt;Introduction, ''The Diary of a Nobody'' (1969), pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt;

As an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He also contributed illustrations to ''Punch'' and the prestigious ''[[The Art Journal|Art Journal]]''.&lt;ref name= JH/&gt; He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as "cowards, cads and snobs", and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which ''The Night of the Party'' (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two [[West End theatre]]s. He died in 1919.&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt; The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the ''Diary'' in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Diary of a Nobody, ed. Peter Morton|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/diary-of-a-nobody/oclc/244313129|publisher= Worldcat|year= 2009|accessdate= 18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers' own home experiences, and that Weedon, "something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother", was the model for Lupin.&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Laurels-house.gif|thumb|"The Laurels", "a nice six-roomed residence, not counting basement"|alt=A drawing of a semi-detached, two-storied house.]]
The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year,  and runs for approximately 15 months.  In a short prologue, readers are informed that [[Charles Pooter]] and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at "The Laurels", Brickfield Terrace, [[Holloway, London|Holloway]]. Mr Pooter is a [[City of London]] clerk with Perkupps, possibly an [[Accountant|accountancy]] or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in [[Oldham]]. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from [[Sutton, London|Sutton]].  From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.

The rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the [[Lord Mayor of London]] to attend a ball at the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] for "Representatives of Trade and Commerce". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished.  Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.

In the summer their son arrives  from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, "Lupin." He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupps. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in   [[Broadstairs]], but relationships are strained by Lupin's "fast" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy  is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the "Holloway Comedians".  With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.
[[File:Daisy-mutlar.gif|thumb|left|upright |Daisy Mutlar|alt=A drawing of a young woman in a dark dress and a bonnet]]
Lupin's fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, "the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: "She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter   invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous;   Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.

In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to "The Laurels". These   occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if of right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.

In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand.  Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the   situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.

April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be   shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.

Lupin is sacked from Perkupps for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillion, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as "Lillie Girl", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and "Lillie Girl".

Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupps a new client to replace Mr Crowbillion. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of "The Laurels" and presents the [[deed]]s to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to "Lillie Girl": "We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings".

The ''Diary'' made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt; The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: "As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody|url= https://archive.org/stream/punchvol94a95lemouoft#page/n271/mode/2up|journal= Punch, or the London Charivari|volume= 94|date= 26 May 1888|page= 241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in ''Punch''.&lt;ref&gt;Hammerton, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Punch'' serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody|url= https://archive.org/stream/punchvol96a97lemouoft#page/n261/mode/2up|journal= Punch, or the London Charivari|volume= 96|date= 11 May 1889|page= 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt;

In June 1892 [[J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd]] published the ''Diary'' in book form,&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt;  although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910.   After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print.

===Early indifference===
{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=left|quote= "It is not so funny that an occasional interruption would be resented, and such thread of story as runs through it can be grasped and followed without much strain on the attention&amp;nbsp;... it is rather difficult to get really interested in the sayings and doings of either the Pooter family or their friends."

The ''Punch'' serialisation attracted little critical comment; ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]''{{'}}s literary critic thought the series "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes".&lt;ref name= Athenaeum/&gt; When the ''Diary'' was published as a book, ''Punch'' heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as "very funny", adding: "not without a touch of pathos".&lt;ref name= P1892&gt;{{cite journal|title= Our Booking-Office|journal= Punch, or the London Charivari|volume= 103|date= 23 July 1892|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from a warmly approving report in ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'', the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The ''Review''{{'}}s critic thought the book "admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: "The ''Diary'' has amused us from cover to cover".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= ''The Diary of a Nobody: Review|publisher= The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science, and Art|volume= 74|date= 23 June 1892|page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted with the negative judgement of ''The Athenaeum'', which opined that "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: "Besides, it is all so dull".&lt;ref name= Athenaeum&gt;{{cite journal|title= Untitled|journal= The Athenaeum|date= 13 August 1892|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Speaker''{{'}}s critic thought the book "a study in vulgarity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Book Review|journal= The Speaker|volume= 6|date= 6 August 1892|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The New York Times]]'', reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: "There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water&amp;nbsp;... Our way of manufacturing fun is different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Untitled|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= 19 December 1892|page= 3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's note in 1910 edition of ''The Diary of a Nobody''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growing reputation===
[[File:Augustine Birrell - Project Gutenberg eText 13220.png|thumb|upright|[[Augustine Birrell]], the Edwardian cabinet minister, was one of the ''Diary''{{'}}s greatest admirers.|alt=A drawing of a man of intellectual appearance]]
By 1910 the ''Diary'' was beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay "On People in Books", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist [[Hilaire Belloc]] hailed the ''Diary'' as "one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time&amp;nbsp;... a glory for us all".&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], the former prime minister who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had "purchased and given away more copies than any living man&amp;nbsp;... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it".&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory note to 1910 edition of ''The Diary of a Nobody'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was [[Augustine Birrell]], who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside [[Don Quixote]] as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—"an illiterate charwoman, it is true"—carried his name.&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory note to 1910 edition of ''The Diary of a Nobody'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition  proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings.{{refn|The 1919 edition lists nine reprintings between the third edition (1910) and the fourth in 1919. Peter Morton has noted that "the history of the early book editions of the Diary is tangled, due to the unwillingness of the publisher to distinguish between an edition and an impression". This has created inconsistencies in later edition numbering.&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt;| group=n}} In its review of this edition ''[[The Bookman (London)|The Bookman]]''{{'}} s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: "You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody: ''Review''|journal= The Bookman|volume= 39|date= December 1910|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919, ''The Bookman'' observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. "It has had many imitators&amp;nbsp;... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away". The reviewer recommended the book's "quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody: ''Review''|journal= The Bookman|volume= 57|date= December 1919|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, ''[[Queen's Quarterly]]'' magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that of the ''New York Times'' nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that "It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody: ''Review''|journal= Queen's Quarterly|volume= 27|year= 1920|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The literary critic [[D. B. Wyndham Lewis]] summarised the Pooters as "warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acclaim===
[[File:Evelynwaugh.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Evelyn Waugh]] praised ''The Diary of a Nobody'' as "the funniest book in the world"]]
The novelist [[Evelyn Waugh]] had been familiar with the ''Diary'' since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—[[Arthur Waugh]] used to read passages aloud to his family,&lt;ref&gt;Waugh 1983 (''A Little Learning''), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay "One Way to Immortality" that it was "the funniest book in the world". He added: "Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years".&lt;ref&gt;Waugh 1983 (''Essays and Reviews''), pp. 84–86. The essay was originally published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 28 June 1930&lt;/ref&gt;  Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world.&lt;ref name= Morton&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morton|first= Peter|title= "The Funniest Book in the World": Waugh and ''The Diary of a Nobody''|url= http://cdm16445.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16445coll12/id/1179 |journal= The Evelyn Waugh Newsletter and Studies|volume= 36|issue= 1|date= Spring 2005|publisher= University of Leicester|location = Leicester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the ''Diary'' "with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression".&lt;ref&gt;Waugh 1945, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt;

At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for the ''Diary'' another writer, [[J. B. Priestley]], was extolling it as an exemplar of [[English humour]]; [[Jerome K. Jerome]], Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: "[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1943 essay, [[George Orwell]] considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who "constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, p. 787&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; [[Osbert Lancaster]] deemed it "a great work of art",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|authorlink= Osbert Lancaster|last= Lancaster|first= Osbert|title= Du Côté de Chez Pooter|magazine=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|issue= 45|date= 21 June 1951|page=995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. [[Gillian Tindall]], writing in 1970, thought the ''Diary'' "the best comic novel in the language", and lauded Pooter as "the presiding shade" of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Gillian Tindall|last= Tindall|first= Gillian|title= Pooter's England|journal= New Society|date= 5 February 1970|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accolade was echoed a further generation on by [[A. N. Wilson]], who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: "Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2003, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as "arbiters of the greatest good taste", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted "period" homes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1989, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Spectator'' article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as "The Laurels", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms "banker land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= Mount|first= Harry|title= Finding Pooter's House|url= http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/2205546/finding-pooters-house/|magazine= The Spectator|date= 8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary and cultural influence==
[[File:Charles and Lupin Pooter.gif|right|250px|thumb|[[Charles Pooter|Charles]] (left) and Lupin Pooter at [[Broadstairs]], from Chapter VI of ''The Diary of a Nobody''|alt=A drawing of two men at the seaside. One is wearing an unusual helmet-like hat]]
Peter Bailey, in his study "White Collars, Gray Lives" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the "disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The Grossmiths' ''Diary'' was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the ''Diary'' "a sharp analysis of social insecurity".&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt; Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, "has long been the intellectual's blood sport".&lt;ref name= bailey274&gt;Bailey, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quarter-century following the publication of ''The Diary of a Nobody'' saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as [[George Gissing]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[E. M. Forster]], characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd.  Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as "[[The Card|Denry Machin]]", "[[The History of Mr Polly|Mr Polly]]" or "[[Love and Mr Lewisham|Mr Lewisham]]", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things.  In cases such as these, writes Bailey, "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man&amp;nbsp;... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis."&lt;ref name= bailey274/&gt;&lt;ref name= hammerton292&gt;Hammerton, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, "been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds".&lt;ref name= Morton/&gt; An early example is [[Anita Loos]]'s novel of 1925: ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady]]'' in which the protagonist, [[Lorelei Lee]], records her flirtatious adventure in prose that "follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, "burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Graham|first= Elyse|title= Gentlemen Prefer Blondes|url= http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Gentlemen_Prefer_Blondes|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100710150303/http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Gentlemen_Prefer_Blondes|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 10 July 2010|work= The Modernism Lab|publisher= [[Yale University]]|accessdate= 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 [[Christopher Matthew]] produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of "Simon Crisp", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Simon Crisp Diaries|url= http://www.bookdepository.com/Simon-Crisp-Diaries-Christopher-Matthew/9780340430774|publisher= [[The Book Depository]]|accessdate= 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the first, ''The Diary of a Somebody'', is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is "affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= Green|first= Benny|title= Pooterism|url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-january-1979/26/pooterism|magazine= [[The Spectator]]|date= 27 January 1979|page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 came the first appearance of [[Sue Townsend]]'s teenage creation, [[Adrian Mole]], whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morton|first= Peter|title= Pootering About: Peter Morton Reminds Us That, a Century before Adrian Mole, There Was Charles Pooter|url= https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-137455836/pootering-about-peter-morton-reminds-us-that-a-century|journal= [[History Today]]|volume= 55|issue= 10|date= October 2005}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Hartley, writing in ''The Spectator'', classed this production as "fair-to-middling", with sympathetic performances from the principals: "[I]t is a precondition of this kind of play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= Hartley|first= Anthony|title= Theatre: The Diary of a Nobody|url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-september-1954/12/theatre-the-diary-of-a-nobody-by-george-and-weedon|magazine= The Spectator|date= 9 September 1954|page=12|accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his "Mrs Pooter" text at the [[Garrick Theatre]], with [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Obituary: Keith Waterhouse|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/theatre-obituaries/6140274/Keith-Waterhouse.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 4 September 2013|location=London|accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version  was revived in 1993 at the [[Greenwich Theatre]] in a production by [[Matthew Francis (producer)|Matthew Francis]].  [[Clive Swift]] and [[Patricia Routledge]] played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in ''The Independent'' described as "essentially a two-hander&amp;nbsp;... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Taylor|first= Paul|title= Ordinary people: Paul Taylor on Patricia Routledge in Mr and Mrs Nobody at Greenwich Theatre|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--ordinary-people-paul-taylor-on-patricia-routledge-in-mr-and-mrs-nobody-at-greenwich-theatre-1469501.html|newspaper= The Independent|date= 27 December 1993|location=London|accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2011 the ''Diary'' was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the [[Royal &amp; Derngate Theatre]], Northampton. Adapted by [[Hugh Osborne]], with an all-male cast led by [[Robert Daws]], this supposes that  Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. [[Quentin Letts]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' found this "an evening of some of the cleverest, fastest entertainment I have seen for months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Letts|first= Quentin|title= Nobody could do this better|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1365098/Nobody-better.html|publisher= Mail Online|date= 10 March 2011|accessdate= 16 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lyn Gardner in ''The Guardian'' found it "a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Gardner|first= Lyn|title= Diary of a Nobody – review|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/15/diary-of-a-nobody-review|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 15 March 2011|location=London|accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2014 a production of the ''Diary'' was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the [[White Bear Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title= Diary of a Nobody: Pootering around on stage - in pictures|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2014/jun/09/diary-of-a-nobody-pootering-around-on-stage-in-pictures|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 9 June 2014|accessdate= 7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later transferred to the [[King's Head Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Diary of a Nobody transfers to King's Head Theatre in July|url= http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/07-2014/the-diary-of-a-nobody-kings-head_34981.html|publisher= WhatsOnStage|date= 7 July 2014|accessdate= 7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This production was revived at the King's |head in 2017;  Time Out said of it: "It captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody|url= https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/the-diary-of-a-nobody|journal= Time Out|date= 13 October 2017|accessdate= 7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first adaptation for screen was [[Ken Russell]]'s short (40 minutes) film for the [[BBC]] film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]], with the text narrated in a voice-over.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (ed.), pp. 7 and 19&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC screened two subsequent adaptations: in 1979 a version dramatised  by [[Basil Boothroyd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Basil Boothroyd 1910–1988|url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095848/|publisher= IMDB|accessdate= 10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 a four-part dramatisation [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], directed by [[Susanna White]] and first shown on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's Edwardian season.&lt;ref name= guardian&gt;{{cite news|title= TV and Radio blog: I hope Diary Of A Nobody is in safe hands|url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/23/ihopediaryofanobodyisin|work= The Guardian | date= 23 April 2007|accessdate= 16 July 2013|location=London|first=Jon|last=Wilde}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic wrote of the latter that [[Hugh Bonneville]] was "immaculate as the ignored kerfuffler [Pooter]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Watch this|first= Sarah|last= Dempster|date= 30 April 2007|work= The Guardian|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/01/tvandradio.comment|accessdate= 2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Radio 4]] (sound radio) has broadcast several dramatisations of the ''Diary''. These include  [[Stephen Tompkinson]] and [[Annette Badland]] in a 2004 adaptation by Kelvin Segger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= If I had a hammer, here's what I'd do|last= Reynolds|first= Gillian|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3623531/If-I-had-a-hammer-heres-what-Id-do.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 7 September 2004|accessdate= 11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and  [[Johnny Vegas]] and [[Katherine Parkinson]] in Andrew Lynch's 2012 adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Classic Serial: The Diary of a Nobody|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k9npd|publisher= [[BBC Radio 4]]|accessdate= 16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] broadcast an audio version of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adaptation, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Keith Waterhouse - Mr and Mrs Nobody|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b055knqf|publisher= [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]|accessdate= 23 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy''''' (also known as '''''Billy &amp; Mandy''''') is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[Maxwell Atoms]] for [[Cartoon Network]], and is the 14th of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]] (albeit on when it was part of ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', due to the ''Cartoon Cartoons'' brand being temporarily discontinued earlier in June 2003; the show itself is considered by some to still be a ''Cartoon Cartoon'' show regardless). It follows two children named Billy—a slow-witted happy-go-lucky boy—and Mandy—his dark and cynical best friend—who, after winning a [[Limbo (dance)|limbo]] game to save Billy's pet hamster, gain the mighty [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] as their best friend in eternal servitude and slavery.

''Billy &amp; Mandy'' began as a series of segments on ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', from which it was spun-off, along with ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', on August 24, 2001. The show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003 to November 9, 2007, but a telefilm, titled ''[[Underfist: Halloween Bash]]'', aired on October 12, 2008, officially bringing the series to a close. In addition to the episodes, three movies, two special episodes, and nineteen shorts were made, with 3 award wins for the series as a whole. ''Billy &amp; Mandy'' has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise. Reruns can currently be seen on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

==Premise==

[[File:BillyandMandyScreen.jpg|thumb|left|The show's main characters. From left to right: Billy, Mandy, and Grim.]]
[[File:Aretxabaleta - graffiti 07.JPG|thumb|left|Graffiti of Grim Reaper in [[Aretxabaleta]] ([[Spain]])]]
The series is centered around the exploits of  Billy (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz]]), a completely idiotic and happy-go-lucky boy; Mandy ([[Grey DeLisle]]), a cynical and merciless girl, and Grim ([[Greg Eagles]]), the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] who is often tormented by the duo. After cheating at a limbo match against Grim (in retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he is enslaved in a permanently  unwanted friendship with the children.&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/billymandy/characters/index.html|title=The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy Characters|work=[[Cartoon Network]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a [[love-hate relationship]] with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude.

Billy and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the [[Underworld]], or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional monsters including [[Dracula]], the [[Wolfman]], and the [[bogeyman]] are also comically depicted in the series.

Supporting characters include Irwin ([[Vanessa Marshall]]), a nerdy awkward boy who has a crush on Mandy; Harold (Richard Steven Horvitz), Billy's father who is even dumber than his son; Gladys (Jennifer Hale), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy ([[Rachael MacFarlane]]), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg (Greg Eagles), the local [[bully]] who has a sensitive side; Fred Fredburger ([[C.H. Greenblatt]]), a simple-minded, irritating underworld creature who loves frozen yogurt and nachos; Dracula ([[Phil LaMarr]]), a selfish elderly vampire who's revealed to be Irwin's paternal grandfather in the final season of the show.

The show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the show together.

==History==
The series had its genesis in 1995, when Maxwell Atoms, while he was a junior at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, made a two-minute short film for his thesis project. Titled ''Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You'', it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing [[trepanning]] with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the first annual TromAnimation Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Maxwell Atoms Reveals Lost Student Film That Inspired 'Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy'|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/maxwell-atoms-reveals-student-film-inspired-grim-adventures-billy-mandy-139336.html|accessdate=2 May 2016|work=Cartoon Brew|date=1 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage, on his YouTube channel.

The show's existence is the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called ''[[Cartoon Network's Big Pick]]'' which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000.&lt;ref name="AWN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/billy-mandy-and-grim-head-movies|title=Billy, Mandy and Grim Head to the Movies|work=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three final choices were ''Grim and Evil'' (later splitting into two separate series: ''The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy'' and ''Evil Con Carne''), ''[[Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?]]'' and ''Longhair and Doubledome''.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt; Out of the three, ''Grim and Evil'' attained the most votes with 57%; ''Robot Jones'' came in second place at 23% while ''Longhair and Doubledome'' received 20% of the vote.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/toon-net-oks-series-based-on-aud-votes-1117785699/|title='Billy &amp; Mandy' beats out 'Robot,' 'Longhair' to get greenlight|first=John|last=Dempsey|date=August 29, 2000|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally part of ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]'', ''Billy &amp; Mandy'' served as the main show. In each episode, an ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'' short was put between two ''Grim'' shorts.&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt; On occasion, it was the other way around, with two ''Evil'' shorts and one ''Grim'' short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the ''Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend''.

On June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave each their own full-length program. The short-lived ''Evil Con Carne'' show was cancelled once the already-produced season had aired. Some characters from ''Evil Con Carne'' occasionally appeared on ''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy''. General Skarr become an official character on the show in the episode "Skarred for Life", where he becomes Billy's new next-door neighbor, and in "Company Halt", the ninth episode of the final season which functions as the true series finale for ''Evil Con Carne'', Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization and convince Skarr to join them, but their plans are ultimately foiled by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal person.

'''''The Multiversity''''' is a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] of interrelated [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] set in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]] in [[The New 52]], a collection of universes seen in publications by [[DC Comics]]. The one-shots in the series were written by [[Grant Morrison]], each with a different artist. ''The Multiversity'' began in August 2014 and ran until April 2015.

==Background and creation==
In the conclusion to the 1985 comic book [[fictional crossover|crossover]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the DC Multiverse collapsed, merging the history of five universes into one single new universe. In the 1998–1999 series ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'', author Mark Waid and co-creator Grant Morrison introduced the concept of [[Hypertime]], a super-dimensional construct that allowed for all publications to be canon or in-continuity somewhere. Hypertime, although infrequently used, was a replacement and explanation for the multiple timelines and histories DC had published through the years.&lt;ref name="Hypertime"/&gt;

In the 2005–06 crossover "[[Infinite Crisis]]", the survivors of the first Crisis—[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from [[Earth-Three]], [[Superboy-Prime]] from [[Earth-Prime]], and [[Kal-L]] of [[Earth-Two]]—had attempted to create a perfect world to replace the current DC Universe (DCU), with Luthor restoring, merging, and destroying worlds that had once existed in the Multiverse or were featured in [[Elseworlds]] publications. Luthor failed, due to the intervention of the universe's heroes, and inadvertently altered the history of the DC Universe. Prior to the publication of ''Infinite Crisis'', editor [[Dan DiDio]] revealed that Hypertime no longer exists in the DCU.&lt;ref name="SDCC2005"/&gt;

Following "Infinite Crisis", the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2006–2007) led to the revelation that Multiverse still exists, in the form of 52 alternate universes. Author Grant Morrison stated that the return of the Multiverse was intended to launch new franchises, explaining:
{{quote|text=The parallel Earths you see in issue #52 are not the familiar pre-Crisis versions. If you think you recognize and know any of these worlds from before, you'd be wrong. We all wanted to do something new with the multiple Earths so what you've already seen in 52 is simply the tip of the iceberg – each parallel world now has its own huge new backstory and characters and each could basically form the foundation for a complete line of new books. If you like the ongoing soap opera dynamics of New Earth, you can watch Mary Marvel turning to the dark side as her skirt gets shorter and shorter, or you can buy the Earth 5 line of books featuring more iconic versions of the Marvel Family. If you miss Vic Sage as the Question, you should be able to follow the adventures of Vic's counterpart on the Charlton/Watchmen world of Earth 4.

The idea behind the Megaverse{{sic}} is to basically create a number of big new franchise possibilities. It's like having several comics companies and universes under one umbrella, so, as I say, there could be one book or a whole line of books spinning out of the new Earth 10 (I handled that particular revamp, so I can tell you that the original concept of the Freedom Fighters on a world where the Nazis won World War 2 has been greatly reconsidered, expanded and intensified into something that's a bit more Wagnerian and apocalyptic and a bit more adult). That's how I'd like to see the Megaverse played out as we move forward. And no crossovers! Each of the parallel universes should exist in its own separate stream with no contact from the others – not until we have a story worthy of bringing them together.&lt;ref name="52ExitMorrison"/&gt;}}

In 2007–08, the weekly series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' (''Countdown to Final Crisis'') was published as a follow up to ''52'' and lead-in to DC's next line-wide crossover "[[Final Crisis]]", along with various spin-off titles featuring the new Multiverse. The Multiverse plays a large part in the ''Final Crisis'' (2008–2009) series, where a team of Supermen from across the Multiverse assemble to defeat a rogue [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]], Mandrakk. The series introduced Calvin Ellis, a new [[Superman]] from Earth-23 who is the [[President of the United States]]. Grant Morrison based the character on [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="ObamaIsSuperman"/&gt; The character would later appear in Grant Morrison's ''Action Comics'' #9 (July 2012) and was a central character in ''The Multiversity''. "Final Crisis" was described by editor Dan DiDio as the finale in a trilogy of stories about the Multiverse, describing each Crisis: "The death of the Multiverse, the rebirth of the Multiverse, and now the ultimate story of the multiverse."&lt;ref name="NYCC2008"/&gt;

When asked about his future role in expanding the Multiverse following "Final Crisis", Morrison stated: "I'm in the early stages of putting together material for a Multiverse series but I want to spend a lot of time getting it exactly right, so there are currently no deadlines and I don't anticipate any of this coming out until 2010."&lt;ref name="FCExitMorrison"/&gt; Morrison later revealed that he had been working on a new book set on Earth-4, featuring [[Charlton Comics]] characters, but inspired by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]'s 1986 limited series ''[[Watchmen]]'', which in turn was proposed initially as being based on Charlton Comics characters.&lt;ref name="Seaguy"/&gt;

In ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #212 (April 2009), Morrison detailed his project, ''The Multiversity'', intended for publication in 2010. Morrison states that the series: "will pick up a bunch of strands from ''52'' and ''Final Crisis''." He noted that his work would include a one-shot for each of seven different universes, where they: "all link together as a seven-issue story that re-imagines the relationship between the DCU and the Multiverse."&lt;ref name="Wizard212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WeeklyCrisis1"/&gt;

Morrison provided Jeffrey Renaud of [[Comic Book Resources]] with further details, explaining the reasoning behind the project: "The idea was to do seven books that would be #1 issues for seven different teams on seven different Earths. Each of these would be the bible for what could potentially be an entire comic line for each of these Earths." Originally, his co-writers ([[Geoff Johns]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Greg Rucka]]) on ''52'' were to have participated in the project.&lt;ref name="CBRMultiversity2009"/&gt;
{{quote box|quote=We were all – that's me and Greg [Rucka] and Geoff Johns and Mark Waid – going to each do a Multiverse book. Waid was going to do the Shazam world. And Greg was going to do the Earth-4, the kind of Charlton world, and I think Geoff was going to do Earth-2 and I was going to do Earth-10. At the end, it didn't work out but I really liked the idea so I came back to it and built this story over it.|source=Grant Morrison&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt;|align=right|width=25%}}
In 2010, it was revealed that Morrison's frequent collaborators [[Cameron Stewart]] and [[Frank Quitely]] were, at the time, the only artists chosen for ''The Multiversity''. Quitely would illustrate ''Pax Americana'',&lt;ref name="BCPaxAmericana"/&gt; featuring Morrison's reworking of the Charlton characters, based on Earth-4. Stewart's one-shot would be ''Thunderworld'',&lt;ref name="BCThunderworld"/&gt; focusing on [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] of Earth-5.&lt;ref name="BCMultiversity"/&gt; Artist [[Frazer Irving]] stated that Morrison "reserved a small part of my soul" to do work on ''The Multiversity''.&lt;ref name="CBR_Irving"/&gt;

In 2011, DC Comics announced that its entire line of publications would be cancelled following "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" (2011), leading into a rebooted DC Universe known as The New 52.&lt;ref name="RelaunchDC"/&gt; The finale of ''Flashpoint'' #5 (September 2011) saw three distinct universes from the Multiverse—[[WildStorm Universe]], [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and the [[DC Universe]]—merge into one universe, designated "Prime Earth". Dan DiDio clarified that there is still a Multiverse, but gave no details on how it has changed and suggested ''The Multiversity'' might provide answers.&lt;ref name="CBR SDCC2011"/&gt; Morrison later revealed that ''The Multiversity'' would not be out until 2012,&lt;ref name="IGN ComicCon"/&gt; noting that Quitely had just begun working on his issue.&lt;ref name="MindlessOnesInterview"/&gt; Morrison also gave a definitive length for the series, 9 one-shots, where two are book-ends with the other 7 each focusing on a different universe.&lt;ref name="MTV interview"/&gt; Tonally, Morrison has described ''The Multiversity'' as feeling similar to his work on ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name="NewsaramaNew52"/&gt;

In September 2012, as part of MorrisonCon, DC Entertainment officially confirmed ''The Multiversity'', giving the series a publication date of late 2013.&lt;ref name="DC2009"/&gt; It was also revealed that the series would feature 8 one-shots, each issue being 38 pages plus an 8-page backup.&lt;ref name="THR"/&gt; Morrison also confirmed that ''The Multiversity'' had not been affected by anything in The New 52, but would still feature a "little sort of wave over to the DC Universe,"&lt;ref name="iFBMultiversity"/&gt; and that The New 52 fits "really nicely into the scheme without doing any damage."&lt;ref name="CBRMultiversityInterview"/&gt;

In February 2013, Morrison stated that he had created a guidebook for DC's Multiverse, incorporating all 52 alternate universes, which other authors reference when working with the multiverse concept. The guidebook was included as the sixth installment of ''The Multiversity'' and was published in January 2015; it contained maps and blueprints to the Multiverse as well as brief descriptions of the meta-humans that populate forty-five out of its fifty-two alternate Earths (with details about Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49 omitted).&lt;ref name="NramaActionFinish"/&gt;

==Publication history==
In April 2014, ''The Multiversity'' was announced for publication in August 2014. The announcement also revealed more of the series' artists including [[Chris Sprouse]], [[Karl Story]], [[Ben Oliver]], Frank Quitely, Cameron Stewart, [[Ivan Reis]], and Joe Prado.&lt;ref name="CBROfficial"/&gt; In May 2014, the first issue, by artists Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, was officially solicited by DC Comics.&lt;ref name="Aug2014Solicits"/&gt; Each subsequent one-shot was published monthly.

In July 2014, during San Diego Comic-Con International, DC Comics held a panel titled "The Multiversity Enrollment", featuring creators Grant Morrison and Cameron Stewart with editor Eddie Berganza. Posters, featuring a map of the Multiverse, designed by Morrison and [[Rian Hughes]], were handed out to attendees of the panel. DC later included a version of the map as a "Channel 52" exclusive at the end of books published in the week of July 28, 2014.&lt;ref name=SDCC2014nrama/&gt;

In May 2015, a [[director's cut]] of the ''Pax American'' one-shot was published.&lt;ref name="MultiversityDirectorsCut" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The Multiversity'' featured a story arc about the DC Comics multiverse being invaded by a race of cosmic parasites known as the [[Gentry (comics)|Gentry]]. The Gentry come from beyond the immediate DC "local" multiverse, and each member is a cultural fear or "bad idea" personified as a living, demonic entity. Intellectron is the immoral genius; Demogorgunn is the mindless, sprawling horde; Hellmachine is unchecked, uncontrollable technology; Dame Merciless is the ultimate extreme of the Femme Fatale; and Lord Broken is insanity and despair.

The Gentry were drawn to the multiverse by the emanations of ruined dreams and negative ideas. They want to seize ownership of every single mind in existence, and in doing so, control all thoughts and stories. To this end, they use ''Ultra Comics #1'' as a vector to infect the multiverse, and they simultaneously launch an attack on every earth in the Orrery of Worlds.

Various heroes from across different universes are forced to band together to face this extra-dimensional threat, initiating the "Battle for All Creation."

==Structure==
The series contained nine issues and consisted of six one-shots, a guidebook containing a map of the multiverse and entries describing each Earth, and a two-part story serving as a prologue and conclusion—which Morrison described as an: "80-page giant DC super-spectacular story."&lt;ref name="MTVGeek2013"/&gt; Each one-shot took place in a different universe, and each publication featured different [[trade dress]] and a different storytelling approach.&lt;ref name=MTVGeek2013/&gt; Morrison explains: "each comic looks like it comes from a different parallel world, so they're all slightly different."&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversityInterview/&gt;

Morrison stated that when developing the series, he had to think of a way for the featured universes to communicate with each other. He recalled the "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]" storyline from ''The Flash'' #123, where the adventures of the Golden Age Flash ([[Jay Garrick]] of Earth-2) were documented as a comic book on Earth-1. He incorporated this [[literary technique|device]] into ''The Multiversity'', stating "they're reading each other's adventures, so there's some way that if a real big emergency arises, they can communicate using comic books. So each world has a comic from the previous world which has clues to the disaster that's coming their way, and they all have to basically start communicating using writers and artists so it's my big, big statement."&lt;ref name="ComicsAlliance2011"/&gt; Morrison further explained how the device was used to create a cohesive story: "[I]t's almost like a baton race or a relay race where each of the worlds can read a comic book that's published in their world but which tells the adventures of the previous world. The characters are actually reading the series along with the readers."

===''The Multiversity'' #1===
The first chapter, illustrated by [[Ivan Reis]], Joe Prado, and Nei Ruffino, ''The Multiversity'' featured Calvin Ellis, President of the United States and Superman of Earth-23.&lt;ref name=CBROfficial/&gt; Morrison described ''The Multiversity'' as a big team book, featuring characters from all over the Multiverse,&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt; the team looked: "after the welfare of the entire multiverse and they're headquartered in a place called the Multiversity."&lt;ref name=iFBMultiversity/&gt; Morrison compared the team to a [[Justice League]] of the Multiverse.&lt;ref name="Collider"/&gt; The team includes characters such as [[Captain Carrot]] as well as Thunderer, an Aboriginal version of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].&lt;ref name="SBSThor"/&gt; It was published in August 2014.&lt;ref name=CBROfficial/&gt;

===''The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World''===
The second chapter, illustrated by [[Chris Sprouse]] and [[Karl Story]], ''The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World'' ("''SOS''") featured the Society of Super-Heroes from Earth-20 and their villainous counterparts from Earth-40. The Society of Superheroes is a [[pulp magazine|pulp]]-style Justice Society of America, led by [[Doctor Fate#Earth-20|Doc Fate]], who had previously appeared in ''Superman Beyond''.&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance2012/&gt; Morrison describes him as: "kind of a [[Doc Savage]]-come-Doctor Fate guy who teams with the [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Mighty Atom]], the [[Immortal Man#Other versions|Immortal Man]], [[Lady Blackhawk#Society of Super-Heroes|Lady Blackhawk]] and her [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]], and [[Abin Sur#Society of Super-Heroes|Abin Sur]], the [[Green Lantern]]. It's all kind of a 1940s retro thing. As I say, it's a pulp take on superheroes,"&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt; along with other recreated "primitive pulp characters".&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance2012/&gt; Morrison described this Earth as having a population of only "two billion people, even though it's 2012." There has been a recent global war akin to World War II, albeit directed against a scion of the al-Ghul dynasty, and an alliance of Arab/Islamic states, the "Desert Crescent".&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance2012/&gt; Earth-40 invaders devastate Earth-20 as its super villains wage global war against the Society of Super Heroes in defense of their home alternate. It was published in September 2014.&lt;ref name="NerdistMultiversity2"/&gt;

===''The Just''===
The third chapter, illustrated by [[Ben Oliver]], ''The Just'' features a world of legacy characters and children of superheroes from Earth-16,&lt;ref name=TheJustSolicit/&gt; such as [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]] and the [[Super-Sons]]. "This is those guys but they're not the main heroes. There's a whole younger generation of heroes—kind of media brats almost."&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt; Morrison describes them as "children of superheroes—a son of Superman, a son of [[Batman]], et cetera—who exist in a world where they have incredible abilities, but the previous generation had ushered in a utopia, so they don't really have any notion of where to direct it, and they're very unhappy with the world as is."&lt;ref name=CraveOnline/&gt; Morrison cites [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' as his inspiration for ''The Just''.&lt;ref name=MTVGeek2013/&gt; Morrison described the idea as: "What happens when your mom and dad fix everything? Superman, Batman and [[Wonder Woman]] have kind of fixed everything so the kids have nothing to do", instead resorting to [[historical reenactment|battle reenactments]], "these kids, they dress up but they've never fought anything."&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance2012/&gt; Morrison had originally conceptualized a "Super-Sons" story as part of his ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' series, where Superman and Batman had stopped all crime, noting that "[o]ne day, I might get to them or some version of it. There's a little bit of that in the "Multiversity" series that I'm doing".&lt;ref name=AllStarInterview/&gt; Morrison originally designated this universe as Earth-11.&lt;ref name=MTVGeek2013/&gt; The one-shot was published in October 2014.&lt;ref name=TheJustSolicit/&gt; Dame Merciless is the Gentry member who is assigned to this world, working confusion and disorientation into the lives of [[Kyle Rayner]]/Green Lantern, Alexis Luthor and [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], appearing in an artwork by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]/[[Superboy]].

===''Pax Americana''===
The fourth chapter, illustrated by Frank Quitely,&lt;ref name=BCPaxAmericana/&gt; ''Pax Americana: In Which We Burn''&lt;ref name="PaxiTunes"/&gt; takes place on Earth-4 and features characters from [[Charlton Comics]]. It has been described by Morrison as: "if Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons had pitched the ''Watchmen'' now, rooted in a contemporary political landscape."&lt;ref name=WeeklyCrisis1/&gt; Rather than the [[Cold War]] focus of ''[[Watchmen]]'', the title's focus is on [[terrorism|international terrorism]] and conspiracy in a world of superheroes.&lt;ref name="CA2010"/&gt; The story is told with an 8-panel grid, similar to ''Watchmen''{{'}}s 9-panel grid layout. The story is based around musical harmonics, as each world in the Multiverse vibrates at a different frequency,&lt;ref name="GlasglowCon"/&gt; with Quitely explaining: "music, and vibration… musical vibrations, the octave, the eight as a repeated motive, and creating patterns leading the eye around the page in a specific way."&lt;ref name="ZN Quitely"/&gt; Morrison describes ''Pax Americana'' as his ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt; The [[Captain Atom]] of this universe had been introduced in ''Final Crisis'' as his world's analogue to Superman.&lt;ref name=WeeklyCrisis1/&gt; Morrison describes [[The Question (comics)|The Question]] as: "a little bit like [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] but absolutely nothing like Rorschach."&lt;ref name="CBRMorrisonCon"/&gt; [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] is described as a good guy, but assassinates the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=CBRMorrisonCon/&gt; The story revolves around the assassination and the failures on part of the Charlton characters.&lt;ref name=THR/&gt; The one-shot was published in November 2014.&lt;ref name=PaxSolicit /&gt;

===''Thunderworld Adventures''===
The fifth chapter, illustrated by Cameron Stewart,&lt;ref name=BCThunderworld/&gt; ''Thunderworld Adventures''&lt;ref name="ThunderiTunes"/&gt; takes place on Earth-5 and features characters from the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] family. Morrison described this book as: "a classic Shazam book but it's done in a way almost like a [[Pixar]] movie or the way we did ''[[All Star Superman]]''. It captures the spirit of those characters without being nostalgic or out of date."&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt; Morrison called it his "attempt to see if you can get the pure note of Captain Marvel, with no irony and no camp and just make it work for everyone. It's like a myth, a little folk tale. It's pure."&lt;ref name="CraveOnline"/&gt; The one-shot was published in December 2014.&lt;ref name="ThunderworldSolicit" /&gt;

In this chapter, [[Doctor Sivana]] reads a copy of ''The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World'', and the comic book inspires him to recruit an army of alternate versions of himself from across the multiverse. Sivana and the Legion of Sivanas pool their resources to develop synthetic, crystallized time called Suspendium, and they use their invention to create an eighth day of the calendar week called Sivanaday. Sivana then pilots a gigantic, technological copy of the [[Rock of Eternity]] into the heart of the Multiverse and captures the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]].

Sivana's machinations result in time distortions all over Fawcett City. While reporting for WHIZ Media, [[Billy Batson]] sees a vision of himself from the future, warning his past self to keep careful track of time. Billy is suddenly attacked by Doctor Sivana's children: Magnificus, Thaddeus Sivana Jr., and Georgia, all of whom have been given superpowers to rival the Marvel Family. Billy transforms into Captain Marvel and battles the Sivanas and the [[Monster Society of Evil]] with assistance from [[Mary Marvel]], [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], the [[Lieutenant Marvels]], and Mister [[Tawky Tawny]].

Captain Marvel journeys through the Multiverse to the Rock of Eternity to put a stop to Sivana's scheme. He discovers that Sivana has stolen the secret of Shazam's magic lightning, and Sivana becomes a hulking, musclebound brute called Black Sivana. Black Sivana appears to be winning the fight, but Captain Marvel transforms back into Billy Batson and uses the Suspendium crystals to transmit a message back through time. The meaning of the message is revealed: each member of the Legion of Sivanas stole Suspendium from the group, depriving Sivanaday the full twenty-four hours to last a complete day. Sivanaday runs out of time and Sivana loses his powers. Having saved the day, Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family fly off to the next big adventure.

===''Guidebook''===
The sixth chapter, illustrated by various artists, featured the ''Multiversity Guidebook'', consisting of detailed entries on all 52 Earths, a map showcasing "all known existence", and a history of the "[[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis]]" events. The one-shot was published in [[80-Page Giant]] format in January 2015.&lt;ref name="GuidebookSolicit" /&gt;

In this chapter, the Little League of the [[Chibi (term)|Chibi]] Earth-42 is attacked by the Legion of Sivanas. The Batman of Earth-42 must team up with the displaced Batman of [[Atomic Knights|post-apocalyptic]] Earth-17 to escape from the Sivanas' army of killer robots. While the Batmen attempt to activate the device used by the Sivanas for crossing from earth to earth, the Batman of Earth-42 learns about events transpiring on Earth-51 by reading about them in the ''Multiversity Guidebook'' comic, where they appear as fictional characters.

On Earth-51, [[Kamandi]], Prince Tuftan, and Ben Boxer investigate a mysterious tomb on the Island of the God-Watchers. They are observed from afar by [[New Gods]] of Supertown, who identify the tomb as the place where [[Darkseid]] was caged and contained. It is revealed by the New Gods of Earth-51 that they can exist across the multiverse as "emanations." It is also revealed that Darkseid has been freed from his tomb by [[Nix Uotan]] – unleashed to assume new forms and spread evil across all reality.

The Batman of Earth-17 escapes to the House of Heroes with the'' Multiversity Guidebook'', only to arrive just as Gentry member Hellmachine launches an all-out assault. The slain members of the Little League return to life, commanded to live and die over and over again by the unseen master of the Gentry: the all-powerful "Empty Hand."

===''Mastermen''===
The seventh chapter, illustrated by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Scott Williams (comics)|Scott Williams]],&lt;ref name="UPROXX Multiversity"/&gt; ''Mastermen'',&lt;ref name="MastermenTitle" /&gt; takes place on Earth-10,&lt;ref name=MTVGeek2013/&gt; and features characters from [[Quality Comics]] as part of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] and Nazi versions of various heroes. The concept is borrowed from Earth-X, a universe where [[Nazi Germany]] won World War II, featured in stories before ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Morrison describes this one-shot as a "big, dark Shakespearean story."&lt;ref name=CBRMultiversity2009/&gt; The members of this world's Freedom Fighters include a [[Jewish]] [[Phantom Lady]], a [[homosexual]] [[Ray (comics)|Ray]], and an African [[Black Condor]], with other members also being representative of groups targeted by the Nazis, such as [[Doll Man]] and Doll Woman, who are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref name="CAMorrisonCon"/&gt; Overman, the Superman of this world, landed on Earth in 1939 in Nazi territory and was raised by [[Adolf Hitler]]. The story is set around a [[utopia]] built by this world's Superman after he realizes the evil nature of Hitler;&lt;ref name=MTVGeek2013/&gt; this Superman "knows his entire society, though it looks utopian, was built on the bones of the dead. Ultimately it's wrong and it must be destroyed."&lt;ref name="Zap2it"/&gt; The one-shot was published in February 2015.&lt;ref name="UPROXX Multiversity"/&gt;

In this chapter, Kal-L landed in the contested Sudetenland in 1939 and his ship was discovered by the Nazis. Kal-L is dubbed Overman by Adolph Hitler and is raised to be a living super-weapon and a symbol of Nazi supremacy. In April 1956, Overman presided over the fall of the United States amidst the devastation of Washington, D.C. Sixty years later, in 2016, Overman is a member of the New Reichsmen, his world's version of the [[Justice League]], which consists of the [[Valkyrie]] Brunnhilde (an alternate Wonder Woman), Underwaterman (an alternate [[Aquaman]]), Leatherwing (an alternate Batman whose grandfather was Hans von Hammer, the protagonist of [[Enemy Ace]]), Blitzen/Lightning (an alternate version of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], who is a female speedster), the Martian (an alternate [[Martian Manhunter]]), and unnamed alternate versions of Green Lantern and [[Red Tornado]]. The world is a technologically advanced utopia, built on the genocide of millions. The guilt-ridden Overman is haunted by the death of his cloned sister, Overgirl, and has recurring nightmares of a towering, ruined house – Lord Broken of the Gentry.

After the [[Human Bomb]] attacks an Overgirl memorial in Metropolis, Overman and the Reichsmen attempt to uncover the truth behind a new terrorist organization called the Freedom Fighters and their leader, the mysterious figure known only as [[Uncle Sam (comics)|"Uncle Sam."]] Uncle Sam warns of a terrible revenge for the Nazi atrocities of the past, and the Reichsmen suspect that they have a traitor on the team. Overman has growing doubt about his cause, but prepares to attend a performance of Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' with his wife, Lena.

Uncle Sam carries out his master plan, and the Human Bomb detonates on board the Reichsmen's orbiting satellite base. The damaged satellite falls to earth, and Overman is unable to stop it from crashing into the city of Metropolis. Millions die and the city is utterly destroyed. Overman is the only survivor, left alone in a crater of ash. The destruction of Metropolis marks "the beginning of the end" of the Nazi empire.

===''Ultra Comics''===
The eighth chapter, illustrated by [[Doug Mahnke]] and Christian Alamy,&lt;ref name=UproxxMultiversityFinal/&gt; ''Ultra Comics'' takes place on [[Earth-Prime|Earth-33]], an alternate name for the real world. It features [[Ultraa]], the first superhero of Earth-Prime. Morrison describes this book as: "the most advanced thing I've ever done. I'm so excited about this. It's just taking something that used to be done in comics and captions that they don't do anymore and turning it into a technique, a weapon, but beyond that I don't want to say. It's a haunted comic book, actually, it's the most frightening thing anyone will ever read. It's actually haunted—if you read this thing, you'll become possessed."&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance2011/&gt; This one-shot was published in March 2015.&lt;ref name=UproxxMultiversityFinal/&gt;

The eighth chapter concerns the creation of Ultra Comics: a synthetic, completely fictional comic book superhero created by "[[meme]]smiths" to battle and defeat a dangerous idea designated as a Hostile Independent Thought-Form. After exploring the ruins of a bizarre, post-apocalyptic New York City, Ultra Comics is betrayed and the HIT is revealed to be Intellectron of the Gentry. Collaborating with the Gentry are the "Neighbourhood Guard", a group of feral, cannibal children, and other versions of Ultra characters from the DC Multiverse, including [[Ultra-Man]], [[Ultra the Multi-Alien]] and several others. The Ultras all serve Ultraa, consort of [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] and joint ruler of her world Almerac. Ultra Comics is ultimately destroyed by Intellectron, but not before trapping it on the last page of the comic – effectively sealing it inside the end of the narrative. The final caption ominously warns the reader that their mind has become infected.

===''The Multiversity'' #2===
The ninth and final chapter, illustrated by Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, ''The Multiversity'' #2 features the final battle between the Gentry and the combined superheroes of the DC Comics Multiverse. The issue was published in April 2015.&lt;ref name=UproxxMultiversityFinal/&gt;

The corrupted Nix Uotan opens doorways across the multiverse that allow the Gentry to complete their invasion, despite attacks from Aquawoman, Thunderer, President Superman, [[Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew|Captain Carrot]], Red Racer, and the [[Champions of Angor|Retaliators]] of Earth-8. Ultimately, Nix Uotan is freed from Gentry control by the Red Racer, working in tandem with every speedster superhero in existence. Uotan reveals that he resisted the Gentry while under their control, and arranged for the same doorways that summoned the Gentry to summon the champions of the Multiverse. The [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger AI]] from the House of Heroes transmits a cosmic SOS across every Earth, calling on all superheroes everywhere to rise to the defense of their worlds.

The Gentry are defeated and driven back. A small group of superheroes pursue the Gentry to the ruined world of Earth-7, where they discover that the members of the Gentry that they fought were merely part of a vast legion of Gentries. The Gentries labor to complete a Multiverse-destroying doomsday weapon called the Oblivion Machine. They are watched over by their master &amp;ndash; a shadowy, unknowable entity called as "The Empty Hand." The Empty Hand informs the gathered heroes that its assessment of the Multiverse is finished, and it then effortlessly banishes the heroes from Earth-7.

At the House of Heroes, the assembled super-beings of the Multiverse vow to work together to protect their worlds from future threats to reality. Organized by President Superman of Earth-23, they form a pan-universal superteam called Justice Incarnate. The superheroes offer to reward Nix Uotan for his role in the rescue of multi-trillions of lives. At first, Nix Uotan declines, but then he remembers something and asks for a small favor. The story ends with Nix in his human form, waking from a dream. He now has the $800.00 he owes to his landlord, and he pays in full.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|single volume]]:

*''The Multiversity [[DC Deluxe Editions|Deluxe Edition]]'' (collects all issues of ''The Multiversity'', 448 pages, hardcover, October 21, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1401256821}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/the-multiversity-deluxe-edition |title=The Multiversity Deluxe Edition |publisher=DC Comics.com |accessdate=April 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/24546-dc-august-2015-solicits-collections.html |title=DC AUGUST 2015 Solicits - COLLECTIONS &amp; VERTIGO |publisher=Newsarama |date=May 18, 2015 |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
On the future of the Multiverse, Morrison explained, "each one of the episodes also sets up a potential series. You could do a Multiverse range of books out of this. All of them are designed to be issue one of potential long-running series as well as being self-contained. It's been a storytelling challenge, but the whole idea is to set stuff up for future development – not necessarily by me, but by DC in some way."&lt;ref name=CraveOnline/&gt; At [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2015, Morrison announced a series of [[original graphic novel]]s under the title ''Multiversity Too''. The series will continue to be written by Morrison, with the first entry, ''Multiversity Too: The Flash'' scheduled to debut in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-morrison-dc-announce-multiversity-too-batman-black-white-ogns|title=SDCC: MORRISON, DC ANNOUNCE "MULTIVERSITY TOO", "BATMAN: BLACK &amp; WHITE" OGNS|last=Mahadeo|first=Kevin|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 11, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Morrison noted the project was on hold. He added, "I felt there was a lot of great Flash material in comics and on TV so I left my take on the table for a while. I'll get to it eventually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7i8khi/comment/dqww64a/?st=JGIM8XDU&amp;sh=a257ca49|title=AMA with Grant Morrison -- Executive Producer of New SYFY Series HAPPY!|last=Morrison|first=Grant|via=[[Reddit]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Tholian Web'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series (season 3)|third season]] of the original American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. It is episode #64, production #64, first broadcast on November 15, 1968, and repeated August 19, 1969. It was written by Judy Burns and Chet Richards and directed by [[Herb Wallerstein]].

In the episode, Captain Kirk is caught between dimensions while the crew of the ''Enterprise'' works to retrieve him. All the while, the Tholians are weaving a destructive energy web around the ''Enterprise'' because Spock will not leave Tholian space without his Captain.

==Plot==
The [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Enterprise'' enters an uncharted region of space while searching for her sister ship, the USS ''[[USS Defiant (NCC-1764)|Defiant]]'', which has been missing for three weeks. Sensors detect what seem to be fractures in space, and an unexplained power loss affects all systems. The ''Defiant'' is found adrift, and Captain [[James T. Kirk]], First Officer [[Spock]], Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], and Navigator Ensign [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] transport across wearing environmental suits for protection. Aboard ''Defiant'', they find the entire crew dead, apparently having killed one another.

The boarding party discovers that the ''Defiant'' is slowly dissolving. At one point, McCoy is able to pass his hand through an almost invisible man and a table. With limited transporter functionality due to the unexplained malfunctions, Kirk orders his men to return to ''Enterprise'' first. The beaming takes much longer than usual, and as Chief Engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Mr. Scott]] finally tries to beam Kirk aboard, the ''Defiant'' vanishes, taking the Captain with it.

Spock determines that the local space is experiencing periods of "interphase", and believes that Kirk will reappear during the next one. As he explains the situation, Chekov lashes out in anger, a symptom that Dr. McCoy believes is due to their proximity to ''Defiant''. Spock, however, refuses to move the ship, fearful of disrupting local space, which would result in the loss of the Captain.
[[File:ST Tholian.jpg|left|A view of [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#L|Loskene, one of the Tholian aliens]]]]
With two hours to go before the next interphase, the ''Enterprise'' is approached by a small, unfamiliar ship. Its captain, Commander Loskene of the Tholian Assembly, asserts that the ''Enterprise'' has violated Tholian space and must leave. Spock persuades him to wait one hour and fifty-three minutes. When the time is up, Kirk does not reappear, and Spock concludes that the Tholian ship has disrupted the interphase.

When the ''Enterprise'' is attacked by Loskene, McCoy again urges Spock to leave, believing that Kirk is dead. Spock chooses to return fire and the Tholian ship is disabled, but the ''Enterprise'' takes damage as well. [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] warns that because of the damage he cannot guarantee that he can hold their position. A second Tholian ship joins the first, and the two begin to weave a vast energy web that cages the ''Enterprise''. Spock determines that if the web is completed before repairs are done, they will be unable to escape.

Spock conducts a memorial service for Kirk, during which another man becomes insane. Spock and McCoy then view a tape left by Kirk meant to be played in the event of his death, which asks the two of them to work together for the benefit of the ship. Lieutenant [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]] and Scott both report seeing ghostly manifestations of Kirk. Finally, this apparition is seen on the bridge; Kirk is still in his environmental suit and appears to be urging Spock to "hurry".

With the Tholian Web nearly complete, McCoy dispenses an antidote to the effects of the local space, and Spock determines the time of Kirk's next appearance. They successfully lock onto Kirk's coordinates, and Spock orders the activation of ship's power, which carries them through the spatial rift to a point 2.72 parsecs away. Kirk is brought along by the transporter lock, and he is beamed aboard just as his oxygen runs out.

Back on the bridge, Kirk questions Spock and McCoy about their handling of the emergency, particularly concerning his final orders. Both claim that they had not had time to listen to them, and Kirk accepts that answer.

==Sequel==
[[File:Ent tw.jpg|left|250px|The completed Tholian web around the alternate universe ISS ''Enterprise'' (NX-01) from ''Star Trek: Enterprise''.]]
In a two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' called "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", it is revealed that the ''Defiant'' has reappeared in the [[Mirror Universe]] of Archer's time, where it is first salvaged by the Tholians and then stolen by the Terran Empire. The ''Defiant'' bridge is recreated in precise detail, even to the positions of the dead crewmen.

==Cultural impact==

In 1997 it became known that [[United States Customs]] investigators had used the name ''"Tholian Web"'' for a technique for embroiling [[child porn]] enthusiasts in internet conversations to trick them into illegal activity.&lt;ref name=PimpsAndPredators/&gt;&lt;ref name=BangorDailyNews1997-09-18/&gt;  
By 1997 it had triggered hundreds of prosecutions.

In 2010 Gerry W. Beyer, of the [[Texas Tech University School of Law]], cited a video recording introduced in this episode, which Captain Kirk, Captain of the starship ''Enterprise'', had left for his two most senior officers to play in the event of his death, urging them to overcome their personal animosity.&lt;ref name=VideoWills2010-04-01/&gt;
Beyer described this fictional recording as one of the first recorded instances of what he called a ''"video-will"''.

Political scientists have compared the metaphor of the entrapment in this episode with the deep challenges politicians and administrators feel when confronted with competing factions and lobby groups.&lt;ref name=MillerThesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buddies/&gt;&lt;ref name=EindproductLeewarden/&gt;

'''Theoderic the Great''' (454 – 30 August 526), often referred to as '''Theodoric''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|i|ˈ|ɒ|d|ər|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-got|{{noitalic|*𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌰𐍂𐌴𐌹𐌺𐍃}}}}, ''{{transl|got|*Þiudareiks}}'', {{lang-la|Flāvius Theodericus}}, {{lang-it|Teodorico}}, {{lang-el|{{noitalic|Θευδέριχος}}}}, ''{{transl|el|Theuderikhos}}'', {{lang-ang|Þēodrīc}}, {{lang-on|{{noitalic|Þjōðrēkr}}}}, {{lang-de|Theoderich}}), was king of the [[Ostrogoths]] (475–526),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grun |first=Bernard |title=The Timetable of History  |origyear=1946 |edition=New Third Revised |year=1991  |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0-671-74271-X |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruler of [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Italy]] (493–526), [[regent]] of the [[Visigoths]] (511–526), and a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patricius]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]. As ruler of the combined Gothic realms, Theoderic controlled an empire stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. He kept good relations between Ostrogoths and Romans, maintained a Roman legal administration and oversaw a flourishing scholarly culture and the largest building program in Italy in 100 years.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=95}}

Theodoric was born in [[Pannonia]] in 454 as the son of king [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Amali]] nobleman, and his concubine [[Ereleuva]]. From 461 to 471, Theoderic grew up as a hostage in [[Constantinople]], received a privileged education under imperial direction, and succeeded his father as leader of the Pannonian Ostrogoths in 473.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Burns, A History of Ostrogoths, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Settling his people in lower [[Moesia]], Theoderic came into conflict with [[Thrace|Thracian]] Ostrogoths led by [[Theodoric Strabo]], whom he eventually supplanted, uniting the peoples in 484. [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] subsequently gave him the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|Patrician]], ''[[Vir gloriosus]]'', and the office of [[Magister militum]] (master of the soldiers), and even appointed him as [[Roman consul|consul]]. Seeking further gains, Theoderic frequently ravaged the provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], eventually threatening Constantinople itself. In 488, Emperor Zeno ordered Theoderic to overthrow the Germanic ''foederatus'' and [[King of Italy]], [[Odoacer]]. After a victorious four-year war, Theoderic killed Odoacer with his own hands while they shared a meal, settled his 200,000 to 250,000 people in [[Italy]], and founded an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] based in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. Burns|first1=Thomas|title=A History of the Ostrogoths|date=1984|publisher=Bloomington: Indiana University Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoderic extended his hegemony over the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|Burgundian]] and [[Vandal Kingdom]]s through marriage alliances. In 511, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] was brought under Theoderic's direct control, forming a Gothic empire that extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adriatic Sea.

Theoderic's achievements began to unravel in his later years. The Burgundians and Vandals threw off Ostrogothic hegemony by 523, and Theoderic's presumptive heir to both Gothic realms and son-in-law [[Eutharic]] died in 522, throwing his succession into doubt. Theoderic's good relations with the [[Roman Senate]] deteriorated due to a presumed senatorial conspiracy in 522, and, in 523, Theoderic had the philosopher and court official [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and Boethius' father-in-law [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus|Symmachus]] executed on charges of treason related to the alleged plot. Theoderic died in Ravenna on 30 August 526, and was succeeded by his grandson [[Athalaric]], with Theoderic's daughter [[Amalasuntha]] serving as regent. The Visigothic Kingdom re-acquired its independence on Theoderic's death.

Seeking to restore the glory of [[Ancient Rome]], he ruled Italy in its most peaceful and prosperous period since [[Valentinian I|Valentinian]]. Memories of his reign made him a [[Legends about Theoderic the Great|hero of German legend]] as [[Dietrich von Bern]].

==Youth==
The man who would later rule under the name of Theoderic was born in AD 454, on the banks of the [[Neusiedler See]] near [[Carnuntum]]. This was just a year after the Ostrogoths had thrown off nearly a century of domination by the [[Huns]]. His Gothic name, which is reconstructed by linguists as ''*Þiudareiks'', translates into "people-king" or "ruler of the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KlmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Thiudareiks&amp;dq=Thiudareiks&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HcPXTYrYIIrFswatoPX3Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgU |title=[[An Encyclopedia of World History]] |first=William Leonard |last=Langer |authorlink=William L. Langer |chapter=Italy, 489–554 |page=159 |publisher=[[George G. Harrap and Co.|Harrap]] |year=1968 |quote=Thiudareiks (ruler of the people)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of King [[Theodemir]] and [[Ereleuva]], Theoderic went to [[Constantinople]] as a young boy, as a [[hostage]] to secure the Ostrogoths' compliance with a treaty Theodemir had concluded with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo the Thracian]] (ruled 457–474).{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=4}}

He was Leo's hostage at the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] from 461 to 471 and was well-educated by Constantinople's best teachers.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=73}} Theodoric was treated with favor by the Emperors [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (ruled 474–475 and 476–491). He settled his people in [[Epirus]] in 479 with the help of his relative [[Sidimund]]. Theodoric became ''[[magister militum]]'' (Master of Soldiers) in 483, and one year later he became [[Roman consul|consul]] in a ceremony in the presence of Emperor Zeno.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=73}} Afterwards, he returned to live among the Ostrogoths when he was 31 years old and became their king in 488. The legend that he was illiterate arose from the fact that he used a stamp to affix his approval of laws; he no doubt spoke Latin and Greek and could read these languages although one cannot know how well.

==Reign==

[[File:Europe at the death of Theoderic the Great in 526.jpg|thumb|The Ostrogothic Kingdom (in yellow) at the death of Theoderic the Great (AD 526)]]
At the time, the Ostrogoths were settled in Byzantine territory as ''[[foederati]]'' (allies) of the Romans, but were becoming restless and increasingly difficult for [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] to manage. Not long after Theoderic became king, the two men worked out an arrangement beneficial to both sides. The Ostrogoths needed a place to live, and Zeno was having serious problems with [[Odoacer]], the King of Italy who had come to power in 476. Ostensibly a viceroy for Zeno, Odoacer was menacing Byzantine territory and not respecting the rights of Roman citizens in Italy. At Zeno's encouragement, Theoderic invaded Odoacer's kingdom. In this endeavor he received the support of the [[Rugii|Rugian]] king [[Frideric]], who was the son of Theodoric's cousin [[Giso]].

Theoderic moved with his people towards Italy in the autumn of 488.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=50}} On the way he was opposed by the [[Gepids]], whom he [[Battle of Sirmium (489)|defeated]] at [[Sirmium]] in August 489.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=50}} Arriving in Italy, Theodoric won the battles of [[Battle of Isonzo (489)|Isonzo]] and [[Battle of Verona (489)|Verona]] in 489.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=50–51}} He was [[Battle of Faenza (490)|defeated]] by [[Odoacer]] at [[Faenza]] in 490, but regained the upper hand after securing victory in the [[Battle of the Adda River]] on August 11, 490.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}} In 493 he [[Siege of Ravenna (490–493)|took]] [[Ravenna]]. On February 2, 493, Theoderic and Odoacer signed a treaty that assured both parties would rule over Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}} A banquet was organised on 15 March 493 in order to celebrate this treaty.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}} It was at this banquet that Theoderic, after making a toast, killed Odoacer; Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}}

[[Image:Theodoric brick.png|thumb|250px|left|Brick with the emblem of Theodoric, found in the [[temple of Vesta]], Rome. It reads "+REG(nante) D(omino) N(ostro) THEODE/RICO [b]O[n]O ROM(a)E", which translates as ''With our master Theodoric the Good reigning in Rome [this brick was made]''.]]

Like Odoacer, Theoderic was ostensibly only a [[viceroy]] for the emperor in Constantinople. In reality, he was able to avoid imperial supervision, and dealings between the emperor and Theoderic were as equals. Unlike Odoacer, however, Theoderic respected the agreement he had made and allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=74}} The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the [[synagogue]]s of Ravenna, Theoderic ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.

Theoderic the Great sought alliances with, or hegemony over, the other Germanic kingdoms in the west. He allied with the [[Franks]] by his marriage to [[Audofleda]], sister of [[Clovis I]], and married his own female relatives to princes or kings of the [[Visigoths]], [[Vandals]] and [[Burgundians]]. He stopped the [[Vandals]] from raiding his territories by threatening the weak Vandal king [[Thrasamund]] with invasion, and sent a guard of 5,000 troops with his sister [[Amalafrida]] when she married Thrasamund in AD 500. For much of his reign, Theoderic was the ''[[de facto]]'' king of the Visigoths as well, becoming regent for the infant Visigothic king, his grandson [[Amalaric]], following the defeat of [[Alaric II]] by the Franks under Clovis in 507. The Franks were able to wrest control of [[Aquitaine]] from the Visigoths, but otherwise Theoderic was able to defeat their incursions.

[[File:Empire of Theodoric the Great 523.gif|thumb|right|Theodoric's empire at the height of its power in 523, with territory marked in pink ruled directly by Theodoric and stippled areas under his hegemony.]]
Theoderic's achievements began to unravel even before his death. He had married off his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] to the Visigoth [[Eutharic]], but Eutharic died in August 522 or 523, so no lasting dynastic connection of Ostrogoths and Visigoths was established. In 522, the [[Catholic]] Burgundian king [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]] killed his own son, Theoderic's grandson, Sergeric. Theoderic retaliated by invading the Burgundian kingdom and then annexing its southern part, probably in 523. The rest was ruled by Sigismund's [[Arianism|Arian]] brother [[Godomar]], under Gothic protection against the Franks who had captured Sigismund. This brought the territory ruled by Theoderic to its height (see map), but in 523 or 524 the new Catholic Vandal king [[Hilderic]] imprisoned Amalafrida and killed her Gothic guard. Theoderic was planning an expedition to restore his power over the Vandal kingdom when he died in 526.
[[File:Theodoric bronze weight inlaid with silver issued by prefect Catulinus Rome 493 526.jpg|thumb|Bronze weight, inlaid with silver, with the name of Theoderic, issued by prefect Catulinus in Rome, 493–526.]]

==Family and progeny==
Theoderic was married once.

He had a concubine in [[Moesia]], name unknown, with whom he had two daughters:
* Theodegotha (ca. 473 – ?). In 494, she was married to [[Alaric II]] as a part of her father's alliance with the Visigoths.
* [[Ostrogotho]] (ca. 475 – ?).&lt;ref&gt; E. T Dailey, ''Queens, Consorts, Concubines: Gregory of Tours and Women of the Merovingian Elite'', (Brill, 2015), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 494 or 496, she was married to the king [[Sigismund of Burgundy]] as a part of her father's alliance with the Burgundians.

By his marriage to [[Audofleda]] in 493 he had one daughter:
* [[Amalasuntha]], Queen of the Goths. She was married to Eutharic and had two children: [[Athalaric]] and [[Matasuntha]] (the latter being married to [[Witiges]] first, then, after Witiges' death, married to [[Germanus Justinus]]; neither had children). Any hope for a reconciliation between the Goths and the Romans in the person of a Gotho-Roman Emperor from this family lineage was shattered.

After his death in Ravenna in 526, Theoderic was succeeded by his grandson [[Athalaric]]. Athalaric was at first represented by his mother Amalasuntha, who served as regent from 526 until 534. The kingdom of the Ostrogoths, however, began to wane and was conquered by [[Justinian I]] in 553 after the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]].

==Building program==
Theoderic promoted the rebuilding of Roman cities and the preservation of ancient monuments in Italy.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=76}} The fame of his building works reached far-away [[Diocese of the East|Syria]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=77}} Theoderic's building program saw more extensive new construction and restoration than that of any of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] [[Roman Emperor]]s after [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (395–423).{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=95}}

===Ravenna===
[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic depiction of the front of Theoderic's Palace on the upper part of the south wall of the nave of San Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. Theoderic and his court were removed from the image by the Eastern Romans.]]
Theoderic devoted most of his architectural attention to his capital, Ravenna.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=78}} He restored Ravenna's water supply by repairing an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] originally built by [[Trajan]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=78}} He proceeded to construct a "Great Basilica of Hercules" next to a colossal statue of [[Hercules]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=78}} To promote Arianism, the king commissioned a small Arian cathedral, the ''Hagia Anastasis'', which contains the [[Arian Baptistery]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=79}} Three more churches built by Theoderic in Ravenna and its suburbs, S. Andrea dei Goti, S. Giorgio and S. Eusebio, were destroyed in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=80}}

Theoderic built the [[Palace of Theoderic]] for himself in Ravenna, modeled on the Great Palace of Constantinople.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=82}} It was an expansion of an earlier Roman structure.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=81}} The palace church of Christ the Redeemer survives and is known today as the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=85}} An equestrian statue of Theoderic was erected in the square in front of the palace.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=87}} This may have been the ''[[Regisole]]'', which was moved to [[Pavia]], then destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] by the local [[Jacobin]] Club.

[[File:Mausoleum of Theoderic.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Theoderic]] in Ravenna.]]
Theoderic the Great was interred in Ravenna, but his bones were scattered and his mausoleum was converted to a church after [[Belisarius]] conquered the city in 540.&lt;ref name="RingSalkin1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M. Salkin|author3=Sharon La Boda|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC&amp;pg=PA556|accessdate=9 October 2010|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-02-2|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Mausoleum of Theodoric|mausoleum]] is one of the finest monuments in Ravenna. Unlike all the other contemporary buildings in Ravenna, which were made of brick, the Mausoleum of Theoderic was built completely from fine quality stone [[ashlar]]s.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=93}}{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=96}}

===Rome===
The [[Palace of Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]] was reconstructed, using the receipts from a specially levied tax.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=77}} The city walls of Rome were rebuilt, a feat celebrated by the [[Senate of Rome]] with a gilded statue of Theoderic.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=77}} The Senate's Curia, the [[Theatre of Pompey]], the city aqueducts, sewers and a granary were refurbished and repaired.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=77}} Statues were set up in the [[Colosseum|Flavian Amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=77}}

==Religion==
[[File:Ravenna, sant'apollinare nuovo, ext. 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], the church of the [[Palace of Theoderic]] in Ravenna.]]
In 522 the philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] became his  ''magister officiorum''  (head of all the government and court services). Boethius was a dedicated Hellenist bent on translating all the works of [[Aristotle]] into Latin and harmonizing them with the works of [[Plato]]. A year later, he was imprisoned and put to death after being accused of treasonous correspondence with the Eastern emperor [[Justin I]].

In the meantime [[Cassiodorus]] had succeeded Boethius as ''magister'' in 523. The pliant historian and courtier could be counted on to provide refined touches to official correspondence.  "To the monarch you [Cassiodorus] were a friendly judge and an honored intimate. For when he became free from his official cares, he looked to your conversation for the precepts of the sages, that he might make himself a worthy equal to the great men of old. Ever curious, he desired to hear about the courses of the stars, the tides of the sea, and legendary fountains, that his earnest study of natural science might make him seem to be a veritable philosopher in the purple" (Cassiodorus' letterbook, ''Variae'' 9.24.8). The gulf was widening between the ancient senatorial aristocracy, whose center was Rome, and the adherents of Gothic rule at Ravenna: other distinguished public figures followed Boethius to the block.

Theoderic in his final years  was no longer the disengaged Arian patron of religious toleration that he had seemed earlier in his reign. "Indeed, his death cut short what could well have developed into a major persecution of Catholic churches in retaliation for measures taken by Justinian in Constantinople against Arians there"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html O'Donnell 1979, ch. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoderic was of the [[Arianism|Arian]] faith. At the end of his reign quarrels arose with his Roman subjects and the Byzantine emperor [[Justin I]] over the Arianism issue. Relations between the two nations deteriorated, although Theoderic's ability dissuaded the Byzantines from waging war against him. After his death, that reluctance faded quickly.

{{Main|Legends about Theoderic the Great}}
Theoderich as ''[[Dietrich von Bern]]'' is an important figure in [[Middle High German]] literature, and as [[Þiðrekssaga|Þiðrekr]] in [[Old Icelandic]]. In German legends, Dietrich becomes an exile from his native kingdom of Lombardy, fighting with the help of [[Attila|Etzel]] against his usurping uncle, [[Ermanaric|Ermenrich]]. Only the [[Old High German]] [[Hildebrandslied]] still contains Odoacer as Dietrich's antagonist. The Old Norse version, based on German sources, moves the location of Dietrich (Thidrek)'s life to [[Westphalia]] and northern Germany. The legends paint a generally positive picture of Dietrich, with only some influence from the negative traditions of the church visible.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|pp=1-10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10139">{{About|the philosophical term "trope"|other uses|Trope (disambiguation){{!}}Trope|}}
The term "'''trope'''" is both a term which denotes [[figurative language|figurative]] and [[metaphor]]ical language and one which has been used in various technical senses. The term ''trope'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τρόπος (''tropos''), "a turn, a change",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*t%3Aentry+group%3D23%3Aentry%3Dtro%2Fpos τρόπος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus ]&lt;/ref&gt; related to the root of the verb τρέπειν (''trepein''), "to turn, to direct, to alter, to change";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | chapter = trope | year = 2009 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trope | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; this means that the term is used metaphorically to denote, among other things, metaphorical language. Perhaps the term can be explained as meaning the same thing as ''a turn of phrase'' in its original sense.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The term is also used in technical senses, which do not always correspond to its linguistic origin. Its meaning has to be judged from the [[Context (language use)|context]], some of which are given below.

==Basic meaning as metaphor==
Here a trope is a figurative and metaphorical use of a word or a phrase. The verb ''to trope'' means then to make a trope.

==Greek philosophy==
{{Main article|Sextus Empiricus}}
A trope or mode is one of the ten skeptical arguments or "ways of refuting [[dogmatism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, E.S.C. ; Simpson, J.A. (1992), ''The Compact Oxford English Dictionary'', New York: Clarendon Press, p.581, {{ISBN|0-19-861258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Sextus Empiricus#The ten modes of Pyrrhonism|The Ten Modes of Pyrrhonism]], described by the Greek physician and philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]].

==In philosophy of history==
{{Main article|philosophy of history}}
The use of tropes has been extended from a linguistic usage to the field of [[philosophy of history]] by, among other theorists, [[Hayden White]] in his ''Metahistory'' (1973). Tropes are generally understood to be styles of [[discourse]] — rather than figures of style — underlying the historian's writing of history. They are historically determined in as much as the [[historiography]] of every period is defined by a specific type of trope.

For Hayden White, tropes historically unfolded in this sequence: [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]], and finally, [[irony]].

==Trope theory in philosophy&lt;!--'Trope theory' and 'Trope nominalism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
{{See also|Nominalism#Varieties}}
'''Trope theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (or '''trope nominalism''') in [[metaphysics]] is a version of [[nominalism]]. Here, a trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific redness of a rose, or the specific nuance of green of a leaf. Trope theories assume that [[universals]] are unnecessary. This use of the term goes back to [[D. C. Williams]] (1953). The basic problem has been discussed previously in philosophy without using the term "trope". The following is a brief background:

The basic problem is the [[problem of universals]].  One part of the problem of universals is determining what it is for two tokens (or separate instances of something) to be of the same type. How can different things be the same? The arguments are complex, and involve [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. Part of the problem would be determining what it is for six different green objects to all be the same in respect to their color.

One classical solution is that of [[Problem of universals#Realism|realism]] as found in the middle period of [[Plato]]'s philosophy, with the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' as a crowning work. According to this solution there are [[idea]]s or [[substantial form|forms]] for any property. These forms exist timelessly as singular, perfect individuals in a metaphysical (timeless, supra-sensible) world of their own. They correspond to what is later called [[universals]]. Somehow the form of a specific color creates many secondary images of itself, as when a prototype is used to make copies or an object casts several shadows. Expressed more abstractly the individual colour-instances (the green of this leaf, the similar green of this frog) all partake in the same idea of green. In Plato the [[theory of forms]] is related to his theses about [[innate knowledge]]. In ''[[Phaedo]]'' the turn of the argument is that we cannot learn from experience what similarity is through [[abstraction]], but must possess it in an innate form before we have any experience (''Phaedo'' 74a-75d).

Nevertheless, Plato in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' dialogue himself formulated several problems for his view. One is: How can the idea, being single, nevertheless be present in a multitude of separate instances without being split apart.

The other solution is that of [[nominalism]]. Here the thesis is that universals such as the [[idea]]s or [[substantial form|form]]s of [[Plato]] are unnecessary in an explanation of language, thought and the world. Only single individuals are real, but they can be grouped together by a human observer through their similarities. Nominalists are usually [[empiricists]]. [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], for example, argued against [[universals]] or [[Abstract object|abstract]] objects using nominalistic arguments. He used the term [[idea]] to denote specific perceptions of an atomistic nature. They could be grouped through similarities or one could take a specific instance, for example the green hue of this frog one is looking at now, as a kind of paradigm case or prototype, and regard everything that was similar to it as belonging to the same type or category. One attraction of the nominalistic program is that if it can be carried out it solves Plato's problem in [[Parmenides]], since the need for a single idea or form or universal ''green'' then vanishes and it can be expunged through [[Occam's razor]], i.e. the rule that, other things being equal, one should not multiply explanatory entities beyond necessity.

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1912, chapter IX) argued against Berkeley and took the same basic position as Plato. His argument was basically one against any form of [[nominalism]]. It says, briefly, that if we introduce several instances of green as separate individuals, we nevertheless have to accept that the reason that we group them together is because they are similar. Therefore, we must presume at least one true universal, that of similarity.

Two popular recent solutions to the problem of universals, as it relates to the possibility of entities existing in multiple locations at the same time, are as follows.

[[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], a prominent Australian philosopher, argues, that there are instantiated universals, like Russell and the middle Plato. Briefly, an instantiated universal is a property (such as being green) that can exist in multiple locations at the same time. Going back to the problem of universals, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to instantiate the universal green. The very same, identical universal green would be wholly located at each green object. To be even more specific, if a frog and a leaf are the same shade of green, the green of the frog and the green of the leaf are one and the same entity (qua green-ness), which happens to be multiply located.

D. C. Williams and [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]], among others, reject instantiated universals in favor of tropes. Briefly, a trope is a property (such as being green) that can only exist in one location at one time. Trope theorists explain what it is for two tokens (individual instances) to be of the same type in terms of resemblance. As an example, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to have its own distinct green trope. Each green trope would be a different entity from the other green tropes, but they would ''resemble'' each other and would all be taken to be green because of their resemblance. 

A metaphysical doctrine embracing both tropes and the objects on which the tropes depend was elaborated by [[Edmund Husserl]] in his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl) | Logical Investigations]]'', as part of what Husserl called 'formal ontology'. Husserl's ideas in this respect were used as the basis for the theory of [[Truthmaker | truthmaking]] put forward by Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith in ''Truthmakers'' (1984) &lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, K., Simons, P. M. and Smith B., "[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/truthmakers/tm.pdf Truth-Makers]", ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 44 (1984), 287–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory it is tropes -- including both individual qualities and events -- that serve as the truthmakers for true atomic sentences such as 'John is hot' or 'Mary is loved by John' or 'John kicked Bill'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10250">'''Two-way communication''' is a form of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in which both parties involved transmit [[information]]. Two-way communication has also been referred to as interpersonal communication. Common forms of two-way communication are:

* [[Amateur|Amateur Radio]], [[CB radio|CB]] or [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] radio contacts.
* [[Chatroom]]s and [[Instant Messaging]].
* [[Computer network]]s. See [[backchannel]].
* In-person [[communication]].
* [[Telephone]] conversations.

A cycle of communication and two-way communication are actually two different things. If we examine closely the anatomy of communication – the actual structure and parts – we will discover that a cycle of communication is not a two-way communication in its entirety. Meaning, two way communication is not as simple as one may infer. One can improve two-way or interpersonal communication by focusing on the eyes of the person speaking, making eye contact, watching body language, responding appropriately with comments, questions, and paraphrasing, and summarizing to confirm main points and an accurate understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improving Interpersonal Communication|url=http://www.utmb.edu/ombudsman/pdf/Improving_Interpersonal_Communication_Techniques.pdf|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-way communication is different from one-way communication in that two-way communication occurs when the receiver provides feedback to the sender. One-way communication is when a message flows from sender to receiver only, thus providing no feedback. Some examples of one-way communication include: radio or television programs or even listening to policy statements from top executives. Two-way communication is especially significant in that it enables feedback to improve a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Two-Way Communication in Business?|url=http://bizcommunicationcoach.com/what-is-two-way-communication-in-business/|website=Business Communication|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-way communication involves feedback from the receiver to the sender. This allows the sender to know the message was received accurately by the receiver.  Communication is also negotiated which means that the sender and receiver listen to each other, the messages then gathers information to respond.  One person is the sender, which means they send a message to another person via face to face, email, telephone, etc.  The other person is the receiver, which means they are the one getting the senders message.  Once receiving the message, the receiver sends a response back.  For example, Person A sends an email to Person B --&gt; Person B responds with their own email back to Person A.  The cycle then continues.
This chart demonstrates two-way communication and feedback.

                        [Sender] &lt;---------
                           |                 \
                      [Encoding]               \

                      [Receiver]----------&gt;

Two-way communication may occur horizontally or vertically in the organization. When information is exchanged between superior and subordinate, it is known as vertical two-way communication. On the other hand, when communication takes place between persons holding the same rank or position, it is called horizontal two-way communication. Two-way communication is represented in the following diagrams: (Cite: https://thebusinesscommunication.com/two-way-communication-and-importance/)                    

                     (Superior)---------------&gt; (Subordinate)---------------&gt; (Superior)
                                (Information)                  (Feedback)



There are many different types of two-way communication systems, and choosing which is best to use depends on things like the intended use, the location, the number of users, the frequency band, and the cost of the system. “Regardless of the type of system chosen, the one common feature is that all of the components must be compatible and work together to support a common purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-two-way-communication-definition-systems-examples.html#transcriptHeader|title=What Is Two-Way Communication? - Definition, Systems, &amp; Examples|last=Fenner|first=Susan|date=|website=Study.com|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-12-20|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Amateur Radio, Citizen Band Radio, and Family Radio Service ==
[[Amateur Radio]] is used for entertainment and as a hobby by many groups of people. These individuals label themselves as “Hams.” Amateur Radios are also known to be a reliable means of communication when all other forms are not operating. In times of disaster, communication through Amateur radios has led to lives being saved.&lt;ref name=Amateur&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Amateur Radio?|url=http://www.arrl.org/what-is-amateur-radio|publisher=The National Association for Amateur Radio|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Citizens band radio]], CB radio, can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government. It is meant for short range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies.&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens Band (CB)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/citizens-band-cb-service|publisher=FCC Encyclopedia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Family Radio Service]], FRS, is also meant for short range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies. Like the CB radio, the FRS does not require a license and can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government.&lt;ref name=FRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Radio Service (FRS)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/family-radio-service-frs|publisher=FCC Encyclopedia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chat Rooms and Instant Messaging ==
[[Instant messaging]] became wildly popular around 1996 and spread even more with AOL in 1997. The concept behind IM is that it is a way of quick communication between two people due to tools such as knowing when messages are seen or knowing when others are online. Many social media sites have integrated IM into their sites as ways to spread communication. [[Chat rooms|Chat Rooms]] are very similar, only they are messages to a group of people. Chat rooms are often public; meaning that you can send a message and anyone can freely join the “room” and view the message as well as respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first=Jeff|title=How Stuff Works- Instant Messaging|url=http://im.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=im&amp;cdn=compute&amp;tm=22&amp;f=10&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=5&amp;bts=75&amp;zu=http%3A//communication.howstuffworks.com/instant-messaging.htm|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roos|first=Dave|title=How Stuff Works- Chat Rooms|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In-person communication ==
As it relates to business, 75% of people believe in-person communication is critical. In-person interaction is useful for resolving problems more efficiently, generating long-term relationships, and resolving a problem or creating an opportunity quickly. 4 out of 6 of the most important attributes of building a relationship cannot be achieved without the power of in-person, which requires a rich communication environment. Business executives believe in-person collaboration is critical for more than 50 percent of key business strategic and tactical business processes when engaging with colleagues, customers, or partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of In-Person Communication|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/telepresence/economist-infographic.html|publisher=Cisco|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telephone conversations ==
The [[telephone]] is a device that is relatively easy to understand and use. In fact, the telephone connections used today have remained remarkably unchanged compared to those used almost a century ago. In addition, your connection to the phone company is rather straightforward as well. The telephone makes it easy to connect instantly with others from all over the world, making it simple to have a two-way conversation with a neighbor or with someone many miles away. Phones have undergone some changes over the years. Today, for example, phones use electronic switches instead of operators. The switch uses a dial tone so that when you pick up the phone you are aware that both the switch and the phone are functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|title=How Stuff Works- How Telephones Work|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/telephone.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks,LLC.|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer networks ==
Computer networks are used to have two-way communication by having computers exchange data.  Ways that this is possible is wired interconnects and wireless interconnects.  Types of wired interconnects are Ethernets and fiber optic cables. Ethernets connect local devices through Ethernet cables. Fiber runs underground for long distances and is the main source of Internet in most homes and businesses. Types of wireless interconnects include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  The problem with these networks is that they don't have unlimited connection span.  To expand the reach there are wide area interconnects such as satellite and cellular networks.  Also, there are long distance interconnects which need ''backhaul'' to move the data back and forth and ''last mile'' to connect the provider to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Bradley|title=How Computer Networks Work- Introduction to Interconnects|url=http://compnetworking.about.com/od/basicnetworkingconcepts/a/how-computer-networks-work-introduction-to-interconnects.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''unisex name''' (also known as an '''epicene name''', a '''gender-neutral name''' or an '''androgynous name''') is a [[given name]] that can be used by a person regardless of their sex. Unisex names are common in the English speaking world, especially in the United States. By contrast, some countries have [[Naming laws|laws]] preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21280101&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, unisex names are sometimes avoided for social reasons such as potential [[discrimination]], ridicule, and [[psychological abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/09/19/banned-baby-names_n_12090708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Names may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language. For example, the Italian [[male name]] ''[[Andrea]]'' (derived from Greek ''Andreas'') is understood as a [[female name]] in many languages, such as English, German, Hungarian, Czech, and Spanish.

Parents may name their child in honor of a person of another sex, which – if done widely – can result in the name becoming unisex. For example, Christians, particularly [[Catholics]], may give a child a second/middle name of the opposite sex, e.g. name a son Marie or Maria in honor of the [[Virgin Mary]] or formerly [[Anne]] for [[Saint Anne]]; or name a daughter José in honor of [[Saint Joseph]] or Jean in honor of [[John the Baptist]]. This practice is rare in English-speaking countries.

Some masculine and feminine names are [[homophone]]s, pronounced the same for both sexes but spelled differently. For example, [[Yves (given name)|Yves]] and [[Eve (name)|Eve]] and (for some speakers) [[Artemus (disambiguation)|Artemus]] and [[Artemis (disambiguation)|Artemis]]. These names are not strictly unisex names.

==In popular culture==
Unisex names can be used as a source of humor, such as [[Julia Sweeney]]'s sexually ambiguous character "[[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]]" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. A running joke on the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' is that almost every woman J.D. sleeps with has a unisex name: Jordan, Alex, Danni, Elliot, Jamie, Kim, etc. Similarly, the sex of the baby Jamie in ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' was purposely kept ambiguous when first introduced at the end of the show's fourth season to build suspense. In ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', Rory is bothered by the discovery that her boyfriend Logan's workmate Bobby, is female. Rory had assumed Bobby was male and it is only upon their first meeting that Rory discovers Bobby's gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rory and Logan: Getting Serious|url=http://crushable.com/entertainment/rory-logan-getting-serious/|publisher=Crushable|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Rory" was historically a male name until ''Gilmore Girls'' reached popularity, at which point the name reached rough gender parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancy.cc/2011/02/09/rory-boy-name-or-girl-name/|title=Rory – Boy Name or Girl Name?|date=2011-02-09|website=Nancy's Baby Names|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese [[dramas]] and [[manga]], a unisex name may be given to an [[androgynous]] or [[gender-bending]] character as part of a plot twist to aid in presenting the character as one sex when they are actually another.

In mystery fiction, unisex names have been used to tease readers into trying to solve the mystery of a character's sex. The novels of [[Sarah Caudwell]] feature a narrator named Hilary Tamar, a law professor who is never identified as either male or female.

===Indian languages===
{{See also|Indian family names}}
Many [[languages of India|Indian]] names become unisex when written with Latin characters because of the limitations of [[transliteration]]. The spellings ''Chandra'' and ''Krishna'', for example, are transliterations of both the masculine and feminine versions of those names. In Indian languages{{Fix|text=in which alphabets?}}, the final ''a'' in each of these names are different letters with different pronunciations, so there is no ambiguity. However, when they are seen (and usually, spoken) by someone unfamiliar with Indian languages, they become sexually ambiguous. Other Indian names, such as ''Ananda'', are exclusively or nearly exclusively masculine in India, but because of their ''a'' ending, are assumed to be feminine in Anglophone societies. 

Many unisex names in India are obvious and ridiculed. For instance [[Nehal]], Sonal, Snehal, Niral, Pranjal and Anmol are used commonly to name baby boys or girls in western states of [[India]] such as [[Gujarat]]. Similarly, names like Kajal, Sujal, Viral, Harshal, Deepal, Bobby, Mrinal, Jyoti, Shakti, [[Neelam (given name)|Nilam]], [[Kiran (given name)|Kiran]], [[Lucky (name)|Lucky]], Ashwini, Shashi, Malhar, Umang, Shubham and Anupam are also very common sex-neutral names or unisex names in India.  Most [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] first names such as "Sandeep, Gurdeep, Kuldeep, Mandeep", "Surjeet, Gurjeet, Kuljeet, Harjeet, Manjeet", "Harpreet, Gurpreet, Jaspreet, Kulpreet, Manpreet", "Prabhjot, Harjot, Gurjot, Jasjot" and "Sukhjinder, Bhupinder, Jasbinder, Parminder, Kulvinder, Harjinder, Ranjodh, Sheeraz, Hardeep, Kirandeep, Sukhdeep, Govindpal, Encarl, Rajan" are unisex names and equally commonly given to either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhnames.com/|title=Sikh Names (SikhNames.com) Sikh Names, Meanings &amp; Pronunciation|first=sikhnames.com -|last=http://www.sikhnames.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, names derived from Dari Persian and Arabic, but not used among native speakers of those languages, are common among South Asian Muslims. Since Persian does not assign genders to inanimate nouns, some of these names are gender-neutral, for example Roshan, Parveen, and Insaaf.

{{See also|Turkish name}}
There are many [[Turkish name]]s which are unisex. These names are almost always pure Turkish names (i.e. not [[Turkish phonology|Turkified]] [[Arabic name]]s that have an [[Islamic]] connotation) that derive from Turkish words. These names may either be modern names or be derived from [[Turkic mythology]]. Some [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived Turkish names, like [[Can (name)|Can]] and [[Cihan]], are also unisex, as are even a few Arabic-derived names, like [[Ihsan (name)|İhsan]] and [[Nur (name)|Nur]].

In the United States, most of the male names are now largely female, while in Britain, some (notably Charlie, Hilary, Sidney, and Robin) remain largely male. Sometimes different spellings have different sex distributions (Francis is less likely female than Frances), but these are rarely definitive.&lt;ref name="nigs"&gt;National Institute for Genealogical Studies, "England Given Name Considerations" [https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/England_Given_Name_Considerations_(National_Institute)]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the US, as of 2016, both Skylar and Skyler are more common for females, but Skylar is most strongly associated with females (the 42nd most common name for females and the 761 most common for males born in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourbabynamer.com/Skylar-name-popularity.html&lt;/ref&gt; than Skyler (the 359 most common name for females and the 414 most common for males born in 2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourbabynamer.com/Skyler-name-popularity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnish law bans giving "female child a male name and male child a female name"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1985/19850694 |title=FINLEX ® - Ajantasainen lainsäädäntö: 9.8.1985/694 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other restrictions. Some ambiguous names do exist, which have been given to children of both sexes. A partial list includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginuutiset.fi/artikkeli/162854-lapsesta-ruu-tai-sirius-sukupuolineutraaleista-nimista-tuli-buumi |title=Lapsesta Ruu tai Sirius? Sukupuolineutraaleista nimistä tuli buumi &amp;#124; Helsingin Uutiset |publisher=Helsinginuutiset.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 
It says on the article they have checked these names from väestörekisteri for having been given for both sexes.

Further, I reduced the list a bit according my arse feel of what of these could pass as first names. Even if the law does not make any difference between first name and the rest, I think it is safe to say the official processing the name form will be really stringent only on the first name. That can't be tested, because the publicly accessible name database does not differentiate on order. --&gt;

Many of these names are rare, foreign or neologism, established names tend to be strongly sex-specific. Notably, a class of names that are derived from nature can be often used for either sex, for example: '''Aalto''' (wave), '''Halla''' (frost), '''Lumi''' (snow), '''Paju''' (willow), '''Ruska''' (fall colors), and '''Valo''' (light). Similarly, there are some (sometimes archaic) adjectives which carry no strong gender connotations, like '''Kaino''' (timid), '''Vieno''' (calm) or '''Lahja''' (a gift). Certain names can have unisex diminutives, such as Alex, which can be short for Aleksandra or Aleksanteri (or variants thereof).

There are also pairs of masculine and feminine names that have slightly different spelling but identical pronunciation, such as André / Andrée, Frédéric / Frédérique and Gabriel / Gabrielle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://french.about.com/od/culture/a/frenchnames_4.htm|title=Patterns of French First Names - Prénoms Français|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]] and French-speaking countries, it can happen for people to have a combination of both masculine and feminine given names, but most of these include "Marie", such as Jean-Marie, Marie-Jean, Marie-Pierre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://french.about.com/od/culture/a/frenchnames.htm|title=Patterns of French First Names - Prénoms Français|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie (given name)|Marie]] was a unisex name in medieval times; it is nowadays only female except for its presence in compound names. Notable examples of people with a combination of masculine and feminine given names are [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] (male), [[Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles]] (male), [[Marie-Pierre Kœnig]] (male), and [[Marie-Pierre Leray]] (female).

European royals often bear the name Marie, the French form of [[Maria (given name)|Maria]], in their names. [[Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este]] (Amedeo '''Marie''' Joseph Carl Pierre Philippe Paola Marcus), [[Prince Jean of Luxembourg]] (Jean Félix '''Marie''' Guillaume), and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis '''Marie''' Adolphe Marc) are examples of male royals who bear Marie in their names.

In the past, [[Germany|German]] law required parents to give their child a sex-specific name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/07/03/mf.baby.naming.laws/index.html|title=Oh no, you can't name your baby THAT! - CNN.com|author=David K. Israel|publisher=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flippo, Hyde "The Germany Way" Published by McGraw-Hill (1996), Pages 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; This is no longer the case, since the [[Constitutional Court|Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] held in 2008 that there is no obligation for a name to be sex-specific, even if the child has only one given name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rk20081205_1bvr057607.html BVerfG, 1 BvR 576/07 vom 5.12.2008], paragraph 16&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of adding a second name which matches the child's legal sex is no longer required. Still, unisex names of German origin are rare, most of them being nicknames rather than formal names (such as Alex).

Examples of unisex names include: 

* Eike
* Evelyn
* [[Gabi (disambiguation)|Gabi]]
* Gustl (the male variant is a shortening of ''August'' or ''Gustav'', the female for ''Augusta'')
* [[Heike (given name)|Heike]]

Unisex names are in general illegal in Iceland (the given name ''Blær'' one of the few exceptions, the first reversal by a judge (and accepted will not be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Iceland|Supreme Court]]) of former denial (as a female name);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/5918||title=Mál nr. 17/2013                    Eiginnafn:     Blær (kvk.) |trans-title=Case 17/2013  Given name:  Blær (female) |website=Department of Justice: Úrskurðir og álit |language=is|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and e.g. ''Auður'' later approved for males,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/6748|title=Mál nr. 73/2013 Eiginnafn: Auður |website=Department of Justice: Úrskurðir og álit |language=is|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Alex'' was denied for females later that the same year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/6761|title=Mál nr. 76/2013 Eiginnafn: Alex |quote=Beiðni um eiginnafnið '''Alex''' (kvk.) er hafnað. [Request for given name '''Alex''' (female) is denied.] |website=Department of Justice: Úrskurðir og álit |language=is|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Icelandic Naming Committee]] (Icelandic: ''Mannanafnanefnd'') has preapproved lists of male and female names (with e.g. ''Ofur''&lt;!--https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/5916--&gt; (e. Super or Uber), ''Lady'',&lt;!--https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/6045--&gt; and ''X''&lt;!--https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/4710--&gt; (as middle name) declined, and for instance ''Þyrnirós''&lt;!--https://www.urskurdir.is/domsogkirkjumala/mannanafnanefnd/nr/6157--&gt; (e. [[Sleeping Beauty]], while literally meaning ''a rose with [[thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]s'') is approved for females).

Additionally traditional patronymic (or rarely matronymic or both) [[Icelandic name|Icelandic last names]] (by law) cannot be unisex. The suffix of the last name ''-dóttir'' ("daughter") is used for female sex; males use the suffix ''-son'' (rare exceptions for foreign females: when using husband's last name as a family name; family names are in general illegal with few exceptions). Given names are also clearly (to Icelanders) masculine or feminine, and [[linguistic gender]] has to match the gender identity of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/newsletters/academic-year-2008-09/article-pdfs/Jun09_willson.pdf |title=Name Law and Gender in Iceland| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211628/http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/newsletters/academic-year-2008-09/article-pdfs/Jun09_willson.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |publisher=UCLA Center for the Study of Women |date=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, the law has been successfully challenged once, for the given male name ''Blær'' (transliterated Blaer) which was exceptionally allowed to be used for females. The Icelandic Naming Committee had for 14 years rejected the registration of Blær as a girl's name in the national census, and the girl in question was registered with the default given name ''stelpa'' ("girl") as the name was not on the list of about 1,853 approved female names. A lower court deemed the name additionally legal for females&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21280101 |title=Icelandic girl Blaer wins right to use given name |publisher=BBC |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state decided not to use its right to appeal.

Among the few exceptions to the gender agreement rule are the traditional name [[Sturla Þórðarson|Sturla]], linguistically feminine, from medieval history always applies to males; and Ilmur ("fragrance" or "odour"), linguistically masculine, must apply to females.

In Italy, unisex names are very rare. There are basically male names like i.e. [[Andrea]] (which is female i.e. in English, Spanish, German or French), Elia or Mattia that can also be given to females. Names like Celeste, Amabile, [[Fiore (disambiguation)|Fiore]], [[Loreto (disambiguation)|Loreto]], or Diamante are, as opposite, female names that occasionally can be given to males.

Sometimes "Maria" is used as a middle male name (such as Antonio Maria).

"Rosario" (feminine: "Rosaria") is a male name in Italian whereas in Spanish is female.

There are also unisex nicknames, i.e. Giusi or Giusy that can stand either for Giuseppe or Giuseppina, respectively "Joseph" and "Josephine"; Dani or Dany which stand for Daniele (male) or Daniela (female); Alex that can stand for Alessandro (male) as well as for Alessandra (female); Fede (literally: "Faith") that can stand either for Federico or Federica.

===Portuguese===

* Carmo

====Brazilian====
Names that end with an ''i'' are considered unisex in Brazil. They tend to be Native Brazilian [[Tupi people|Indian]] names in origin, such as Araci, Jaci, Darci, Ubirani, but names from other cultures are now being absorbed, such as Remy, Wendy, and Eddy. Names that end with ''ir'' and ''mar'' tend to be unisex also, such as Nadir, Aldenir, Dagmar and Niomar - though in these cases there are some exceptions.

===Russian===
{{See also|Eastern Slavic naming customs}}

Diminutive forms of names in Russian language can be unisex, such as Sasha/Shura (Alexandr or Alexandra), Zhenya (Yevgeniy or Yevgeniya), Valya (Valentin or Valentina), Valera (Valeriy or Valeriya), [[Slava (disambiguation)|Slava]] (for names ending with -slav or -slava).

===Slovene===
* Fran (diminutive of Frančiška)
* Ivica (diminutive of ''Ivan'' (John) or ''Ivana'' (Joanne))
* Saša (diminutive of ''Aleksander'' (Alexander))
* Slava (diminutive of Slavko)
* Vanja (diminutive of Ivan or Ivana)

===Spanish===
{{See also|Spanish naming customs}}
In Spain, unisex names are extremely rare. María, an originally feminine name is used in Spanish for males as second name, very commonly after José (e.g., [[José María]]). José is used for females preceded by María ([[María José]]). Also [[Guadalupe (name)|Guadalupe]], a feminine name is sometimes used as masculine after José (José Guadalupe). More names given to both genders include [[Carmen (name)|Carmen]], Inés, [[Reno (given name)|Reno]], [[Trinidad (disambiguation)|Trinidad]], [[Nazaret]], [[Reyes (disambiguation)|Reyes]], and [[Celes (disambiguation)|Celes]]. 

Like in English, some common nicknames are unisex such as Álex ([[Alejandro]], [[Alejandra]]), Cris ([[Cristina (disambiguation)|Cristina]], [[Cristiano (given name)|Cristian]], [[Cristóbal (disambiguation)|Cristóbal]]), Dani ([[Daniel]], [[Daniela]]).

==Cross-cultural==
Some names are masculine in one culture and feminine in another, so that when these cultures mix in a third location, the same name appears unisex. Some example are:

* [[Adel (name)|Adel]], a masculine name in Arabic and Persian-speaking countries, and a female name in Jewish-speaking countries or Hungarian as Adél
* Aki, a male name in Finland and Nigeria, and unisex in Japan
* [[Ami (given name)|Ami]], a feminine name in Japan and English-speaking countries but unisex in Hebrew-speaking countries and India
* [[Eli (name)|Eli]], a masculine name of Hebrew origin in English and Jewish-speaking countries and a feminine name in Spanish, Norwegian, and Danish-speaking countries
* Jules, masculine in French but unisex in English-speaking countries
* [[Karen (name)|Karen]], a female name in America, parts of Europe and Asia, and masculine in Armenia, Kurdistan, and Iran
* [[Kiko (given name)|Kiko]], masculine in Spanish, Portuguese, and South America and feminine in Japan
* [[Manu (disambiguation)|Manu]], masculine in Finland and parts of India, and unisex in parts of Europe such as France and Germany
* [[Mao (given name)|Mao]], a feminine name in Japan and a masculine name in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]
* [[Miho]], female in Japan and male in Croatia
* Mika, a male name in Finland and a female name in Japan
* Moe, masculine in English-speaking countries and feminine in Japan
* Naomi, a feminine name in America, Europe and Hebrew-speaking countries, and unisex in Japan
* Nima, masculine in Persia but unisex in Arabic
* Olie, a unisex name in English-speaking countries, and a feminine name in Indonesia
* Ren, feminine in Taiwan and unisex in Japanese and English-speaking countries
* [[Yury|Yuri]], a male name in Russia and [[Yuri (Japanese name)|Yuri]] or [[Yu-ri (Korean name)|Yu-ri]], a female name in Japan and Korea

'''Unnamed Press''' is an independent publisher based in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Unnamed Press publishes [[literary fiction]] and [[non-fiction]], with an emphasis on debuts by women, underrepresented voices and people of color, as well as internationally focused speculative and fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unnamed Press &gt; About|url=http://www.unnamedpress.com/about|website=Unnamed Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its art director, Jaya Nicely, is an LA-based illustrator and designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaya Nicely &gt; About|url=http://www.jayanicely.com/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Unnamed Press was founded in 2013 by C.P. Heiser and Olivia Taylor Smith after meeting in 2011 at the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] and was originally intended to be an ebook-only publisher, focused on genre fiction set outside of the United States.&lt;ref name=PW2015&gt; {{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Anisse|title=Unnamed Press Creating Home For Contemporary Authors|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/65736-unnamed-press-creating-home-for-contemporary-authors.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press began with early success in publishing global fiction from Deji Bryce Olukotun (''Nigerians in Space''), [[Kristiina Ehin]] (''Walker on Water''), and [[Kazi Anis Ahmed]] (''Good Night, Mr. Kissinger'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nawotka|first1=Edward|title=LA’s Unnamed Press: Relatable Foreign Fiction, Unlikely Protagonists|url=https://publishingperspectives.com/2014/07/las-unnamed-press-relatable-foreign-fiction-unlikely-protagonists/|publisher=Publishing Perspectives|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly evolved to a traditional publishing model, and now releases between 12 and 15 print titles per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulin|first1=David L.|title=Talking with the publishers of new L.A.-based Unnamed Press|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-talking-with-la-publisher-unnamed-press-20140422-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Unnamed Press reached a milestone of 50 books published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulin|first1=David L.|title=How Small, Scrappy Local Book Presses Have Turned L.A.

The '''Voluntary System of Accountability''' ('''VSA''') and its '''College Portraits''' website is a college search tool for prospective students and an accountability tool for public institutions.&lt;ref name=Fullerton&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Voluntary System of Accountability (VSA) College Portrait Project|url=http://www.fullerton.edu/collegeportrait/|publisher=Fullerton|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students and their families can use the College Portraits to find a presentation of comparable information that comes directly from public universities.&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;{{cite web|title=College Portrait of Undergraduate Education|url=http://www.msu.edu/vsa/|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Participating institutions use the College Portraits to highlight common information prospective students and families seek.  College Portraits data elements include: admissions requirements, [[University student retention|retention]] and graduation rates, campus community highlights, academic programs, [[safety]], and [[cost of attendance]], to name a few.   In 2010, a College Affordability Estimator [[net price calculator]] was added to help prospective students estimate their individual net cost to attend a specific university.  The Estimator meets the requirements of the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]].

Institutions and systems can use the College Portraits to meet accountability requirements from governing boards, [[state legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], state coordinating offices, and other outside groups, often reducing their burden and duplication of effort.  The [[College Portraits]] can also be used during the accreditation process as evidence of student learning outcomes, institutional improvement, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and commitment to the public good.&lt;ref name=NSSE&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSE and the Voluntary System of Accountability|url=http://nsse.iub.edu/html/vsa.cfm|publisher=NSSE|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The VSA is a joint project of the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities]] (APLU) and the [[American Association of State Colleges and Universities]] (AASCU) in collaboration with the higher education community.&lt;ref name=Fullerton /&gt;   VSA institutions represent more than half of all public four-year institutions, 66 percent of all APLU members, and 60 percent of APLU and AASCU's joint membership.  VSA participating institutions enroll 63 percent of [[undergraduate students]] attending public universities.

'''''Vortigern and Rowena''''', or '''''Vortigern, an Historical Play''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] that was touted as a newly discovered work by [[William Shakespeare]] when it first appeared in 1796. It was eventually revealed to be a [[Shakespeare Apocrypha|Shakespeare hoax]], the product of prominent forger [[William Henry Ireland]].&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Ashe  | first = Geoffrey | author-link = Geoffrey Ashe  | contribution = (Samuel) William Henry Ireland  | editor-last = Lacy  | editor-first = Norris J.  | title = The New Arthurian Encyclopedia  | volume =   | pages = 244  | publisher = Garland  | place = New York  | year = 1991  | contribution-url =  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first performance was April 2, 1796, when it was ridiculed by the audience. Its titular protagonists, [[Vortigern]] and [[Rowena]], are figures from Britain's [[Matter of Britain|traditional history]].

==History==
Ireland had produced several [[Ireland Shakespeare forgeries|earlier documents]] he claimed represented the writings of Shakespeare, but ''Vortigern and Rowena'' was the first play he attempted. He shortly followed it with a forged ''[[Henry II (play)|Henry II]]''. He had announced his "discovery" of the lost play as early as December 26, 1794, but did not show his father a manuscript until March 1795. He also provided a purported correspondence between Shakespeare and a printer explaining why the play was unpublished, as well as a deed accounting for how it came to be in hands of the Irelands.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, pp. 62-66.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the deed, Shakespeare had willed all the manuscripts to an ancestor of the Irelands, also named William Henry Ireland, who had saved him from drowning. Years later, Ireland explained that he came up with this story to establish his right to the manuscripts in case a descendant of the bard might claim them.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account''. pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing of a newly recovered "lost" Shakespeare play, Irish playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] purchased the rights to the first production at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in [[London]] for 300 pounds and the promise of half the revenues to Ireland's family. After reading the play, Sheridan noted its relative simplicity compared to Shakespeare's known works. Actor [[John Philip Kemble]], the manager of Drury Lane, and who would play the title role in the play's only production, had serious doubts about ''Vortigern'''s authenticity. [[Sarah Siddons]], who had been cast as the title female role, dropped out one week before the scheduled opening for unknown reasons, though it is suspected that Kemble had successfully turned the famous actress against the work as well. &lt;ref&gt;Doug Stewart, ''The Boy Who Would be Shakespeare'' (2010) &lt;/ref&gt; Irish Shakespearean scholar [[Edmond Malone]] published ''An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments'' on March 21, 1796, about the authenticity of ''Vortigern'' and the other documents "discovered" by Ireland. Siddons' role of ''Edmunda'' was taken by [[Mrs Powell]] when it opened on 2 April 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/22641|title=Powell [Renaud], Jane (c. 1761–1831), actress|last=Crouch|first=K.

When ''Vortigern and Rowena'' opened on April 2, 1796, Kemble used the chance to hint at his opinion by repeating Vortigern's line "and when this solemn mockery is o'er," and the play was derided by the audience. It was never performed again until 2008. Some early critics accused William Henry Ireland's father Samuel of the forgery, though William assumed responsibility in two printed confessions. Samuel himself continued to regard the play as authentic and edited it in 1799, including a foreword in which he attacked Malone's findings and denounced the "illiberal and injurious treatment" he had received.&lt;ref name="CamelotProject"/&gt; Nevertheless, neither Ireland's reputation recovered from the fiasco, and William eventually moved to [[France]], where he lived for several decades. He tried to publish ''Vortigern and Rowena'' as his own work when he returned to England in 1832, but met with little success.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story begins as the [[King of the Britons]] [[Constans II (usurper)|Constantius]] offers half his crown to his adviser Vortigern for his loyal service. Vortigern immediately plots the king's murder in order to take the crown for himself. Meanwhile, the court [[Jester|Fool]] warns two of Vortigern's children, [[Pascent]]ius and Flavia, of the bad times ahead and the three of them leave the court with Flavia in drag. Constantius' sons Aurelius ([[Ambrosius Aurelianus]]) and Uter ([[Uther Pendragon]]), studying in Rome, receive word of Vortigern's treachery and go to [[Scotland]] to raise an army against their father's killer. In response Vortigern summons an army of [[Saxons]], led by [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist and Horsus]], to defend him from the Scots. He falls in love with Hengist's beautiful daughter [[Rowena]], and proclaims her his queen, much to the chagrin of his wife Edmunda and his two remaining sons, Wortimerus ([[Vortimer]]) and Catagrinus ([[Catigern]]), who flee. Vortigern's family eventually all join Aurelius and Uter's army, and Aurelius and Flavia declare their mutual love. In the end the Saxons are routed and Aurelius defeats Vortigern but spares his life, and then marries Flavia. The final speech is delivered by the Fool, who admits that the play is not very tragic, as "none save bad do fall, which draws no tear".&lt;ref name="CamelotProject"/&gt;

==Sources==
Like other apocryphal plays attributed to Shakespeare, ''[[The Birth of Merlin]]'' and ''[[Locrine]]'', ''Vortigern and Rowena'' takes the [[Matter of Britain]] as its subject, drawing especially from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicle'', the same source used by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt; Shakespeare used Britain's mythical history in several of his plays, including ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]'', based on the stories of [[Leir of Britain]] and [[Cunobelinus]], respectively.  The play is essentially a pastiche of Shakespeare, with Vortigern serving as a Macbeth figure; other Shakespearean elements include the use of Holinshead and Flavia's cross-dressing.&lt;ref name="NAE"/&gt;

==Modern revival==
The play experienced a comedic revival by the [[Pembroke Players]] at the [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] New Cellars, [[Cambridge]], on November 19, 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camdram.net/shows/08/vortigern?type=view |title=Vortigern |publisher=Association of Cambridge Theatre Societies |work=CamDram.net - Shows |quote=Join the Pembroke Players for a one-night stand in the New Cellars on November the 19th [2008], possibly this play’s first performance for over two hundred years... |accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was directed by Pembroke third-year Alexander Whiscombe, and starred David Harrap in the title role with Eystein Thanisch as Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;Winterbotham, Alex (November 20, 2008).

The earliest surviving references date from the 12th century and call the language {{lang|yi|לשון־אַשכּנז|rtl=yes}} (''loshn-ashknaz'', "language of Ashkenaz") or {{lang|yi|טײַטש|rtl=yes}} (''taytsh''), a variant of ''tiutsch'', the contemporary name for [[Middle High German]]. Colloquially, the language is sometimes called {{lang|yi|מאַמע־לשון|rtl=yes}} (''mame-loshn'', {{literal translation}} "mother tongue"), distinguishing it from {{lang|yi|לשון־קדש|rtl=yes}} (''[[Lashon Hakodesh|loshn koydesh]]'', "holy tongue"), meaning Hebrew and Aramaic. The term "Yiddish", short for ''Yidish Taitsh'' "Jewish German", did not become the most frequently used designation in the literature until the 18th century. In the late 19th and into the 20th century the language was more commonly called "Jewish", especially in non-Jewish contexts,{{clarification needed|date=July 2018}} but "Yiddish" is again the more common designation today.{{cn| date= November 2018}}

Modern Yiddish has [[Yiddish dialects|two major forms]]. Eastern Yiddish is far more common today. It includes Southeastern (Ukrainian–Romanian), Mideastern (Polish–Galician–Eastern Hungarian), and Northeastern (Lithuanian–Belarusian) dialects. Eastern Yiddish differs from Western both by its far greater size and by the extensive inclusion of words of Slavic origin. Western Yiddish is divided into Southwestern (Swiss–Alsatian–Southern German), Midwestern (Central German), and Northwestern (Netherlandic–Northern German) dialects. Yiddish is used in a number of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] communities worldwide; it is the first language of the home, school, and in many social settings among many Haredi Jews, and is used in most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and many [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] [[yeshiva]]s.

The term "Yiddish" is also used in the adjectival sense, synonymously with "Jewish", to designate attributes of [[Yiddishkeit]] ("Ashkenazi culture"; for example, [[Jewish cuisine#Jewish cuisine variations|Yiddish cooking]] and "Yiddish music": [[klezmer]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Oscar Levant]] described [[Cole Porter]]'s '[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]" as "one of the most Yiddish tunes ever written" despite the fact that "Cole Porter's genetic background was completely alien to any Jewishness." Oscar Levant,''[[The Unimportance of Being Oscar]]'', Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 32. {{ISBN|0-671-77104-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to [[the Holocaust]], there were 11–13 million speakers of Yiddish among 17 million Jews worldwide.&lt;ref name=yivo-yiddish/&gt; 85% of the approximately 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust were Yiddish speakers,&lt;ref name="Sprache 1984 p. 3"&gt;[[Solomon Birnbaum]], ''Grammatik der jiddischen Sprache'' (4., erg. Aufl., Hamburg: Buske, 1984), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a massive decline in the use of the language. Assimilation following [[World War II]] and ''[[aliyah]]'', immigration to Israel, further decreased the use of Yiddish both among survivors and among Yiddish-speakers from other countries (such as in the Americas). However, the number of speakers is increasing in Hasidic communities.

==Origins==
The established view is that, as with other Jewish languages, Jews speaking distinct languages learned new co-territorial vernaculars, which they then Judaized. In the case of Yiddish, this scenario sees it as emerging when speakers of [[Zarphatic language|Zarphatic]] and other Judeo-Romance languages began to acquire varieties of [[Middle High German]], and from these groups the Ashkenazi community took shape.&lt;ref name=ELL&gt;{{ELL2|Yiddish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spolsky" &gt;{{cite book |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Spolsky |title=The Languages of the Jews: A Sociolinguistic History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xk9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-91714-8 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly what German base lies behind the earliest form of Yiddish is disputed.

In Weinreich's model, Jewish speakers of [[Old French]] or [[Old Italian]] who were literate in either liturgical Hebrew or Aramaic, or both, migrated through Southern Europe to settle in the [[Rhine Valley]] in an area known as [[Lotharingia]] (later known in Yiddish as ''Loter'') extending over parts of Germany and France;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Weinreich]], ''History of the Yiddish Language,'' ed. Paul Glasser, Yale University Press/ YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 2008 p.336.&lt;/ref&gt; There, they encountered and were influenced by Jewish speakers of [[High German languages]] and several other German dialects. Both Weinreich and [[Solomon Birnbaum]] developed this model further in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Weinreich |editor1-first=Uriel |title=The Field of Yiddish |year=1954 |publisher=Linguistic Circle of New York |pages=63–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Weinreich's view, this Old Yiddish substrate later bifurcated into two distinct versions of the language, Western and Eastern Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Fleischer" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Aptroot |first1=Marion |last2=Hansen |first2=Björn |title=Yiddish Language Structures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ynoBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |year=2014 |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |isbn=978-3-11-033952-9 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; They retained the Semitic vocabulary and constructions needed for religious purposes and created a Judeo-German form of speech, sometimes not accepted as a fully autonomous language.

Later linguistic research has finessed the Weinreich model or provided alternative approaches to the language's origins, with points of contention being the characterization of its Germanic base, the source of its Hebrew/Aramaic adstrata, and the means and location of this fusion. Some theorists argue that the fusion occurred with a Bavarian dialect base.&lt;ref name="Spolsky" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs |first=Neil G. |title=Yiddish: a Linguistic Introduction |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77215-X |pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main candidates for the germinal matrix of Yiddish, the Rhineland and Bavaria, are not necessarily incompatible. There may have been parallel developments in the two regions, seeding the Western and Eastern dialects of Modern Yiddish. [[Dovid Katz]] proposes that Yiddish emerged from contact between speakers of High German and Aramaic-speaking Jews from the Middle East.&lt;ref name=yivo-yiddish&gt;{{cite web |last=Dovid Katz |title=YIDDISH |url=http://yivo.org/downloads/Yiddish.pdf |work=[[YIVO]] |accessdate=20 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322162722/http://yivo.org/downloads/Yiddish.pdf |archivedate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines of development proposed by the different theories do not necessarily rule out the others (at least not entirely); an article in ''[[The Forward]]'' argues that "in the end, a new 'standard theory' of Yiddish’s origins will probably be based on the work of Weinreich and his challengers alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Philologos |title=The Origins of Yiddish: Part Fir|url=http://forward.com/culture/202706/the-origins-of-yiddish-part-fir/ |work=The Forward |date=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] proposed a model in 1991 that took Yiddish, by which he means primarily eastern Yiddish,&lt;ref name="Fleischer" /&gt; not to be genetically grounded in a Germanic language at all, but rather as "Judeo-Sorbian" (a proposed West Slavic language) that had been [[relexification|relexified]] by High German.&lt;ref name="Spolsky" /&gt; In more recent work, Wexler has argued that Eastern Yiddish is unrelated genetically to Western Yiddish. Wexler's model has met with little academic support, and strong critical challenges, especially among historical linguists.&lt;ref name="Spolsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleischer" /&gt;

==History==
By the 10th century, a distinctive Jewish culture had formed in [[Central Europe]] which came to be called {{lang|he|אַשכּנזי|rtl=yes}} ''Ashkenazi'', "[[Ashkenazi Jews]], from {{lang-he|אַשכּנז}} ''[[Ashkenaz]]'' ({{bibleverse||Genesis|10:3|HE}}), the medieval [[Hebrew name]] for northern Europe and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Kriwaczek, Paul (2005). Yiddish Civilization: The Rise and Fall of a Forgotten Nation. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-82941-6}}., Chapter 3, footnote 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkenaz was centered on the [[Rhineland]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] (notably [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]]), in what is now the westernmost part of Germany. Its geographic extent did not coincide with the German principalities of the time, and it included northern [[France]]. Ashkenaz bordered on the area inhabited by another distinctive Jewish cultural group, the [[Sephardi Jews]], who ranged into [[southern France]]. Ashkenazi culture later spread into [[Eastern Europe]] with large-scale population migrations.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Nothing is known with certainty about the [[vernacular]] of the earliest Jews in Germany, but several theories have been put forward. The first language of the Ashkenazim may, as noted above, have been the [[Aramaic language]], the vernacular of the Jews in [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman-era Judea]] and ancient and early medieval [[Mesopotamia]]. The widespread use of Aramaic among the large non-Jewish [[Syrians|Syrian]] trading population of the Roman provinces, including those in Europe, would have reinforced the use of Aramaic among Jews engaged in trade. In Roman times, many of the Jews living in [[Rome]] and [[Southern Italy]] appear to have been [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers, and this is reflected in some Ashkenazi personal names (e.g., ''Kalonymos'' and Yiddish ''Todres''). Hebrew, on the other hand, was regarded as a holy language reserved for ritual and spiritual purposes and not for common use. Much work needs to be done, though, to fully analyze the contributions of those languages to Yiddish.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It is generally accepted that early Yiddish was likely to have contained elements from other languages of the [[Near East]] and Europe, absorbed through migrations. Since some settlers may have come via France and Italy, it is also likely that the Romance-based Jewish languages of those regions were represented. Traces remain in the contemporary Yiddish vocabulary: for example, {{lang|yi|בענטשן|rtl=yes}} (''bentshn'', "to bless"), ultimately from the Latin ''{{lang|la|benedicere}}''; {{lang|yi|לייענען|rtl=yes}} (''leyenen'', "to read"), from the Old French ''lei(e)re''; and the personal names {{lang|yi|בונים|rtl=yes}} Bunim (related to French '' bon nom'', good name) and Yentl (Old French ''gentil'', "noble"). Western Yiddish includes additional words of ultimate Latin derivation (but still very few): for example, {{lang|yi|אָרן|rtl=yes}} ''orn'' (to pray), cf. Old French "orer".&lt;ref&gt;Beider, Alexander (2015). Origins of Yiddish Dialects. {{ISBN|978-0-19-873931-9}}, pp. 382-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish community in the Rhineland would have encountered the many dialects from which [[Standard German]] would emerge a few centuries later. In time, Jewish communities would have been speaking their own versions of these German dialects, mixed with linguistic elements that they themselves brought into the region. Although not reflected in the spoken language, a main point of difference was the use of the Hebrew alphabet for the recording of the Germanic vernacular, which may have been adopted either because of the community's familiarity with the alphabet or to prevent the non-Jewish population from understanding the correspondence. In addition, there was probably widespread illiteracy in the non-Hebrew script, with the level of illiteracy in the non-Jewish communities being even higher. Another point of difference was the use of Hebrew and Aramaic words. These words and terms were used because of their familiarity, but more so because in most cases there were no equivalent terms in the vernacular which could express the Jewish concepts or describe the objects of cultural significance.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, songs and poems in Yiddish, and [[macaronic language|macaronic]] pieces in Hebrew and German, began to appear. These were collected in the late 15th century by Menahem ben Naphtali Oldendorf.&lt;ref&gt;''Old Yiddish Literature from Its Origins to the Haskalah Period'' by Zinberg, Israel. KTAV, 1975. {{ISBN|0-87068-465-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, a tradition seems to have emerged of the Jewish community's adapting its own versions of German secular literature. The earliest Yiddish epic poem of this sort is the ''[[Dukus Horant]]'', which survives in the famous Cambridge Codex T.-S.10.K.22. This 14th-century manuscript was discovered in the [[Cairo Geniza]] in 1896, and also contains a collection of narrative poems on themes from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Haggadah]].

=== Printing ===
The advent of the [[printing press]] in the 16th century enabled the large scale production of works, at a cheaper cost, some of which have survived. One particularly popular work was [[Elia Levita]]'s ''[[Bovo-Bukh]]'' ({{lang|yi|בָּבָֿא-בּוך}}), composed around 1507–08 and printed several times, beginning in 1541 (Isny) (under the title: Bovo d'Antona). Levita, the earliest named Yiddish author, may also have written {{lang|yi|פּאַריז און װיענע|rtl=yes}} ''Pariz un Viene'' ([[Paris]] and [[Vienna]]). Another Yiddish retelling of a chivalric romance, װידװילט ''Vidvilt'' (often referred to as "Widuwilt" by Germanizing scholars), presumably also dates from the 15th century, although the manuscripts are from the 16th. It is also known as ''Kinig Artus Hof'', an adaptation of the Middle High German romance ''Wigalois'' by [[Wirnt von Gravenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Speculum, A Journal of Medieval Studies'': [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7652280&amp;fileId=S0038713400099498 Volume 78, Issue 01, January 2003, pp 210–212]&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant writer is Avroham ben Schemuel Pikartei, who published a paraphrase on the [[Book of Job]] in 1557.

Women in the Ashkenazi community were traditionally not literate in Hebrew, but did read and write Yiddish. A body of literature therefore developed for which women were a primary audience. This included secular works, such as the ''Bovo-Bukh'', and religious writing specifically for women, such as the {{lang|yi|צאנה וראינה|rtl=yes}} ''[[Tseno Ureno]]'' and the {{lang|yi|תחנות|rtl=yes}} ''[[Tkhine]]s''. One of the best-known early woman authors was [[Glückel of Hameln]], whose memoirs are still in print.
[[File:Page from Yiddish-Hebrew-Latin-German dictionary by Elijah Levita.jpg|thumb|A page from the [http://cf.uba.uva.nl/nl/publicaties/treasures/page/p08.html ''Shemot Devarim''] ({{literal translation}} ''Names of Things''), a Yiddish–Hebrew–Latin–German dictionary and thesaurus, published by Elia Levita in 1542]]

The segmentation of the Yiddish readership, between women who read {{lang|yi|מאַמע־לשון|rtl=yes}} ''mame-loshn'' but not {{lang|yi|לשון־קדש|rtl=yes}} ''loshn-koydesh'', and men who read both, was significant enough that distinctive [[typeface]]s were used for each. The name commonly given to the semicursive form used exclusively for Yiddish was {{lang|yi|ווײַבערטײַטש|rtl=yes}} (''vaybertaytsh'' = "women's ''taytsh''," shown in the heading and fourth column in the adjacent illustration), with square Hebrew letters (shown in the third column) being reserved for text in that language and Aramaic. This distinction was retained in general typographic practice through to the early 19th century, with Yiddish books being set in ''vaybertaytsh'' (also termed {{lang|yi|מעשייט|rtl=yes}} ''mesheyt'' or {{lang|yi|מאַשקעט|rtl=yes}} ''mashket''—the construction is uncertain).&lt;ref&gt;Max Weinreich, געשיכטע פֿון דער ייִדישער שפּראַך (New York: YIVO, 1973), vol. 1, p. 280, with explanation of symbol on p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional distinctive semicursive typeface was, and still is, used for rabbinical commentary on religious texts when Hebrew and Yiddish appear on the same page. This is commonly termed [[Rashi script]], from the name of the most renowned early author, whose commentary is usually printed using this script. (Rashi is also the typeface normally used when the Sephardic counterpart to Yiddish, [[Judaeo-Spanish]] or ''Ladino'', is printed in Hebrew script.)

A ''[[Maskil]]'' (from the same root word as ''Haskalah'') would write about and promote acclimatization to the outside world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-development-of-yiddish |title=History &amp; Development of Yiddish |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |language=en |access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish children began attending secular schools where the primary language spoken and taught was German, not Yiddish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Owing to both assimilation to German and the [[Modern Hebrew|revival of Hebrew]], Western Yiddish survived only as a language of "intimate family circles or of closely knit trade groups". ([[#liptzin1972|Liptzin 1972]]).

In eastern Europe, the response to these forces took the opposite direction, with Yiddish becoming the cohesive force in a [[secularity|secular culture]] (see the [[Yiddishist movement]]). Notable Yiddish writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries are Sholem Yankev Abramovitch, writing as [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]]; Sholem Rabinovitsh, widely known as [[Sholem Aleichem]], whose stories about {{lang|yi|טבֿיה דער מילכיקער|rtl=yes}} (''Tevye der milkhiker'', "[[Tevye]] the Dairyman") inspired the Broadway musical and film ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''; and [[I. L. Peretz|Isaac Leib Peretz]].

=== 20th century ===

In the early 20th century, especially after the Socialist [[October Revolution]] in Russia, Yiddish was emerging as a major Eastern European language. Its rich literature was more widely published than ever, [[Yiddish theatre]] and [[Yiddish cinema]] were booming, and it for a time achieved status as one of the official languages of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]],&lt;ref name=HoUJsntui/&gt; the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} and the short-lived [[Galician Soviet Socialist Republic]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} and the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]. Educational autonomy for Jews in several countries (notably [[Poland]]) after [[World War I]] led to an increase in formal Yiddish-language education, more uniform orthography, and to the 1925 founding of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, [[YIVO]]. In [[Vilnius]], there was debate over which language should take primacy, Hebrew or Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/vilna/before/hebrew_or_yiddish.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki Hebrew or Yiddish?] in the online exhibition [http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/vilna/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki The Jerusalem of Lithuania: The Story of the Jewish Community of Vilna] by [[Yad Vashem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiddish changed significantly during the 20th century. [[Michael Wex]] writes, "As increasing numbers of Yiddish speakers moved from the Slavic-speaking East to Western Europe and the Americas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were so quick to jettison Slavic vocabulary that the most prominent Yiddish writers of the time—the founders of modern Yiddish literature, who were still living in Slavic-speaking countries—revised the printed editions of their oeuvres to eliminate obsolete and 'unnecessary' Slavisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Born to Kvetch]]: Yiddish Language and Culture in All Its Moods |last=Wex |first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Wex |year=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=29 |isbn=0-312-30741-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocabulary used in Israel absorbed many Modern Hebrew words, and there was a similar but smaller increase in the English component of Yiddish in the United States and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This has resulted in some difficulty in communication between Yiddish speakers from Israel and those from other countries.

== Phonology ==
{{Main article|Yiddish phonology}}
Yiddish phonology is similar to [[Standard German phonology|that of Standard German]]. However, it does not have [[final-obstruent devoicing]] and [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] ([[voicelessness|voiceless]]) [[stop consonant]]s are unaspirated, and the {{IPA|/χ/}} phoneme is invariably uvular, unlike the German phoneme {{IPA|/x/}}, which is palatal, velar, or uvular.

Yiddish has a smaller inventory of [[vowel]]s than Standard German and no [[vowel length]] distinction.

== Numbers of speakers ==
[[File:Yiddish.png|thumb|Map of the Yiddish dialects between the 15th and the 19th centuries (Western dialects in orange / Eastern dialects in green).]]
On the eve of [[World War II]], there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers.&lt;ref name=yivo-yiddish/&gt; [[The Holocaust]], however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life, were largely destroyed. Around five million of those killed — 85 percent of the Jews who died in the Holocaust — were speakers of Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Sprache 1984 p. 3"/&gt; Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war (including nearly all Yiddish speakers in the Americas), further assimilation in countries such as the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], along with the strictly monolingual stance of the [[Zionist]] movement, led to a decline in the use of Eastern Yiddish. However, the number of speakers within the widely dispersed Haredi (mainly Hasidic) communities is now increasing. Although used in various countries, Yiddish has attained official recognition as a minority language only in [[Moldova]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/erkende-talen/talen-in-nederland |title=Talen in Nederland &amp;#124; Erkende talen |publisher=Rijksoverheid.nl |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sweden]].

Reports of the number of current Yiddish speakers vary significantly. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' estimates, based on publications through 1991, that there were at that time 1.5 million speakers of Eastern Yiddish,&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;{{e18|ydd|Eastern Yiddish}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 40% lived in Ukraine, 15% in Israel, and 10% in the United States. The [[Modern Language Association]] agrees with fewer than 200,000 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060619224705/http://www.mla.org/cgi-shl/docstudio/docs.pl?map_data_results Most spoken languages in the United States], Modern Language Association.

==Status as a language==
There has been frequent debate about the extent of the linguistic independence of Yiddish from the languages that it absorbed. There has been periodic assertion that Yiddish is a dialect of German, or even "just broken German, more of a linguistic mishmash than a true language".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/29/science/scholars-debate-roots-of-yiddish-migration-of-jews.html "Scholars Debate Roots of Yiddish, Migration of Jews"], George Johnson, ''New York Times'', October 29, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Even when recognized as an autonomous language, it has sometimes been referred to as Judeo-German, along the lines of other Jewish languages like [[Judeo-Persian]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]] or Zarphatic. A widely cited summary of attitudes in the 1930s was published by [[Max Weinreich]], quoting a remark by an auditor of one of his lectures: {{lang|yi|אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמיי און פֿלאָט|rtl=yes}} (''a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bisso.com/ujg_archives/pix/armyNavyFull.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051030022701/http://www.bisso.com/ujg_archives/pix/armyNavyFull.jpg |archivedate=2005-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]").

=== Israel and Zionism ===
[[File:Yidish graffiti.JPG|thumb|An example of graffiti in Yiddish, Tel Aviv, Washington Avenue (און איר זאלט ליב האבן דעם פרעמדען, ווארום פרעמדע זייט איר געווען אין לאנד מצרים ''Un ir zolt lib hobn dem fremdn varum fremde seit ir geven in land mitsrayim''). {{lang|en|"Ye shall have love for the stranger, because ye were strangers in the land of Egypt (Deuteronomy 10:19)"}}]]
The national language of Israel is Hebrew. The debate in Zionist circles over the use of Yiddish in Israel and in the Diaspora in preference to Hebrew also reflected the tensions between religious and secular Jewish lifestyles. Many secular Zionists wanted Hebrew as the sole language of Jews, to contribute to a national cohesive identity. Traditionally religious Jews, on the other hand, preferred use of Yiddish, viewing Hebrew as a respected holy language reserved for prayer and religious study. In the early 20th century, Zionist activists in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] tried to eradicate the use of Yiddish among Jews in preference to Hebrew, and make its use socially unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rozovsky |first=Lorne |url=http://www.chabad.org/1051135 |title=Jewish Language Path to Extinction |publisher=Chabad.org |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflict also reflected the opposing views among secular Jews worldwide, one side seeing Hebrew (and Zionism) and the other Yiddish (and [[internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]]) as the means of defining Jewish nationalism. In the 1920s and 1930s, {{Script|Hebr|גדוד מגיני השפה}} ''gdud maginéi hasafá'', "the language defendants regiment", whose motto was "{{Script|Hebr|עברי, דבר עברית}} ''ivri, dabér ivrít''," that is, "Hebrew [i.e. Jew], speak Hebrew!", used to tear down signs written in "foreign" languages and disturb Yiddish theatre gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2: 40-67, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the members of this group in particular, and the Hebrew revival in general, did not succeed in uprooting Yiddish patterns (as well as the patterns of other European languages Jewish immigrants spoke) within what he calls "Israeli", i.e. [[Modern Hebrew]]. Zuckermann believes that "Israeli does include numerous Hebrew elements resulting from a conscious revival but also numerous pervasive linguistic features deriving from a subconscious survival of the revivalists’ mother tongues, e.g. Yiddish."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2: 40-67, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of the State of Israel, a massive wave of [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish immigrants from Arab countries]] arrived. In short order, these [[Mizrahi Jews]] and their descendants would account for nearly half the Jewish population. While all were at least familiar with Hebrew as a liturgical language, essentially none had any contact with or affinity for Yiddish (some, of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] origin, spoke Judaeo-Spanish, others various [[Judeo-Arabic languages]]). Thus, Hebrew emerged as the dominant linguistic common denominator between the different population groups.

In religious circles, it is the Ashkenazi [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]], particularly the Hasidic Jews and the Lithuanian yeshiva world (see [[Lithuanian Jews]]), who continue to teach, speak and use Yiddish, making it a language used regularly by hundreds of thousands of Haredi Jews today. The largest of these centers are in [[Bnei Brak]] and [[Jerusalem]].

There is a growing revival of interest in Yiddish culture among secular Israelis, with the flourishing of new proactive cultural organizations like YUNG YiDiSH, as well as [[Yiddish theatre]] (usually with simultaneous translation to Hebrew and Russian) and young people are taking university courses in Yiddish, some achieving considerable fluency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/09/yiddish_studies.html Yiddish Studies Thrives at Columbia After More than Fifty Years] – Columbia News.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former Soviet Union ===
In the Soviet Union during the 1920s, Yiddish was promoted as the language of the Jewish [[proletariat]].

[[File:Emblem of the Byelorussian SSR (1927).svg|thumb|State emblem of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] with the motto ''Workers of the world, unite!'' in Yiddish (lower left part of the ribbon): ״'''פראָלעטאריער פון אלע לענדער, פאראייניקט זיך!'''״, ''Proletarier fun alle lender, fareynikt sich!'' The same slogan is written in Belarusian, Russian and Polish.]]
It was one of the official languages of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Until 1938, the [[Emblem of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] included the motto ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' in Yiddish. Yiddish was also official language in several agricultural districts of the [[Galician Soviet Socialist Republic]].

A public educational system entirely based on the Yiddish language was established and comprised kindergartens, schools, and higher educational institutions (technical schools, [[rabfak]]s and other university departments). At the same time, Hebrew was considered a [[bourgeois]] language and its use was generally discouraged. The vast majority of the Yiddish-language cultural institutions were closed in the late 1930s, along with cultural institutions of other ethnic minorities lacking administrative entities of their own. The last Yiddish-language schools, theaters and publications were closed by the end of the 1940s. It continued to be spoken widely for decades, nonetheless, in areas with compact Jewish populations (primarily in Moldova, Ukraine, and to a lesser extent Belarus).

In the former Soviet states, recently active Yiddish authors include Yoysef Burg ([[Chernivtsi]] 1912–2009) and [[Olexander Beyderman]] (b. 1949, [[Odessa]]). Publication of an earlier Yiddish periodical ({{lang|yi|דער פֿרײַנד|rtl=yes}} - der fraynd; lit. "The Friend"), was resumed in 2004 with {{lang|yi|דער נײַער פֿרײַנד|rtl=yes}} (''der nayer fraynd''; lit. "The New Friend", [[Saint Petersburg]]).

==== Russia ====
According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]], 1,683 people spoke Yiddish in Russia, approximately 1% of all the Jews of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab6.xls |title=Информационные материалы всероссийской переписи населения 2010 г.

The Jewish Autonomous Oblast was formed in 1934 in the [[Russian Far East]], with its capital city in Birobidzhan and Yiddish as its official language. The intention was for the Soviet Jewish population to settle there. Jewish cultural life was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Yiddish theaters began opening in the 1970s. The newspaper {{lang|yi|דער ביראָבידזשאַנער שטערן|rtl=yes}} ([[Birobidzhaner Shtern|''Der Birobidzhaner Shtern'']]; lit: "The Birobidzhan Star") includes a Yiddish section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gazetaeao.ru/idish |title=Birobidzhaner Shtern in Yiddish |publisher=Gazetaeao.ru |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the official status of the language was not retained by the Russian Federation, its cultural significance is still recognized and bolstered.

The first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century. The Jewish population in Sweden is estimated at around 20,000. Of these, according to various reports and surveys, between 2,000 and 6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish. In 2009, the number of native speakers among these was estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750–1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Parkvall, ''Sveriges språk. Vem talar vad och var?''. RAPPLING 1.

In the United States, at first most Jews were of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] origin, and hence did not speak Yiddish. It was not until the mid-to-late 19th century, as first German, then Eastern European, Jews arrived in the nation, that Yiddish became dominant within the immigrant community. This helped to bond Jews from many countries. {{lang|yi|פֿאָרווערטס|rtl=yes}} (''Forverts'' – ''[[The Forward]]'') was one of seven Yiddish daily newspapers in [[New York City]], and other Yiddish newspapers served as a forum for Jews of all European backgrounds. In 1915, the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition, thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Moses Shapiro|title=Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American &amp; International Journalism During the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3lItIwOzCkC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=KTAV|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical circulation in the 21st century is a few thousand. The ''Forward'' still appears weekly and is also available in an online edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{yi icon}} [http://yiddish.forward.com/ פֿאָרווערטס]: ''[[The Forward]]'' online.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in wide distribution, together with {{lang|yi|דער אַלגעמיינער זשורנאַל|rtl=yes}} (''der algemeyner zhurnal'' – ''[[Algemeiner Journal]]''; ''algemeyner'' = general), a [[Chabad]] newspaper which is also published weekly and appears online.&lt;ref&gt;{{yi icon}} [http://www.algemeiner.com/generic.asp?cat=4 דער אַלגעמיינער זשורנאַל] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106211758/http://www.algemeiner.com/generic.asp?cat=4 |date=2011-01-06 }}: ''Algemeiner Journal'' online&lt;/ref&gt; The widest-circulation Yiddish newspapers are probably the weekly issues {{lang|yi-Latn|[[Der Yid]]}} ({{lang|yi|דער איד|rtl=yes}} "The Jew"), {{lang|yi-Latn|[[Der Blatt]]}} ({{lang|yi|דער בלאַט|rtl=yes}}; ''blat'' "paper") and {{lang|yi-Latn|[[Di Tzeitung]]}} ({{lang|yi|די צייטונג|rtl=yes}} "the newspaper"). Several additional newspapers and magazines are in regular production, such as the weekly אידישער טריביון ''Yiddish Tribune'' and the monthly publications {{lang|yi|דער שטערן|rtl=yes}} (''Der Shtern'' "The Star") and {{lang|yi|דער בליק|rtl=yes}} (''Der Blik'' "The View"). (The romanized titles cited in this paragraph are in the form given on the masthead of each publication and may be at some variance both with the literal Yiddish title and the [[Yiddish orthography#Transliteration|transliteration rules]] otherwise applied in this article.) Thriving Yiddish theater, especially in the New York City [[Yiddish Theatre District]], kept the language vital. Interest in [[klezmer]] music provided another bonding mechanism.

Most of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of [[Ellis Island]] considered Yiddish their native language; however, native Yiddish speakers tended not to pass the language on to their children, who assimilated and spoke English. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]] states in his autobiography ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' that Yiddish was his first and sole spoken language, and remained so for about two years after he emigrated to the United States as a small child. By contrast, Asimov's younger siblings, born in the United States, never developed any degree of fluency in Yiddish.

Many "Yiddishisms", like "Italianisms" and "Spanishisms", entered [[New York City English]], often used by Jews and non-Jews alike, unaware of the linguistic origin of the phrases. [[Yiddish words used in English]] were documented extensively by [[Leo Rosten]] in ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]''; see also the [[list of English words of Yiddish origin]].

In 1975, the film ''[[Hester Street (film)|Hester Street]]'', much of which is in Yiddish, was released. It was later chosen to be on the [[Library of Congress]] [[National Film Registry]] for being considered a "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" film.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2011/11-240.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the Canadian-born American author [[Saul Bellow]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He was fluent in Yiddish, and translated several Yiddish poems and stories into English, including [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s "Gimpel the Fool".

In 1978, [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], a writer in the Yiddish language, who was born in [[Poland]] and lived in the United States, received the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Legal scholars [[Eugene Volokh]] and [[Alex Kozinski]] argue that Yiddish is "supplanting Latin as the spice in American legal argot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |authorlink= |author2=Kozinski, Alex |year=1993 |title=Lawsuit, Shmawsuit |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=463–467 |doi=10.2307/797101 |accessdate= |quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc. |jstor=797101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: an updated version of the article appears on Professor Volokh's UCLA web page, {{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/yiddish.htm |title=Judge Alex Kozinski &amp; Eugene Volokh, "Lawsuit, Shmawsuit" &lt;*&gt; |publisher=Law.ucla.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Present U.S. speaker population ====
In the [[2000 United States Census]], 178,945 people in the United States reported speaking Yiddish at home. Of these speakers, 113,515 lived in [[New York (state)|New York]] (63.43% of American Yiddish speakers); 18,220 in [[Florida]] (10.18%); 9,145 in [[New Jersey]] (5.11%); and 8,950 in [[California]] (5.00%). The remaining states with speaker populations larger than 1,000 are [[Pennsylvania]] (5,445), [[Ohio]] (1,925), [[Michigan]] (1,945), [[Massachusetts]] (2,380), [[Maryland]] (2,125), [[Illinois]] (3,510), [[Connecticut]] (1,710), and [[Arizona]] (1,055). The population is largely elderly: 72,885 of the speakers were older than 65, 66,815 were between 18 and 64, and only 39,245 were age 17 or lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&amp;lang_id=609&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;a=&amp;ea=&amp;order=r Language by State: Yiddish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919151951/http://www.mla.org/map_data_states%26lang_id%3D609%26mode%3Dlang_tops%26a%3D%26ea%3D%26order%3Dr |date=2015-09-19}}, [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] Language Map Data Center, based on U.S. Census data.

There are a few predominantly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities in the United States in which Yiddish remains the majority language including concentrations in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhoods of Brooklyn. In [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]] in [[Orange County, New York]], in the 2000 census, nearly 90% of residents of Kiryas Joel reported speaking Yiddish at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/census_data_results&amp;state_id=36&amp;place_id=39853 Data center results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016053859/http://www.mla.org/census_data_results%26state_id%3D36%26place_id%3D39853 |date=2015-10-16}} [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
There are well over 30,000 Yiddish speakers in the United Kingdom, and several thousand children now have Yiddish as a first language. The largest group of Yiddish speakers in Britain reside in the [[Stamford Hill]] district of North [[London]], but there are sizable communities in northwest London, [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]] and [[Gateshead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2097943.ece |title=Yiddish once again speaks for itself |first=Jack |last=Shamash |date= March 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yiddish readership in the UK is mainly reliant upon imported material from the United States and Israel for newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. However, the London-based weekly ''[[Jewish Tribune (UK)|Jewish Tribune]]'' has a small section in Yiddish called {{lang|yi|אידישע טריבונע|rtl=yes}} ''Yidishe Tribune''. From the 1910s to the 1950s, London had a daily Yiddish newspaper called די צײַט (''Di Tsayt'', {{IPA-yi|dɪ tsaɪt}}; in English, ''The Time''), founded, and edited from offices in [[Whitechapel Road]], by Roumanian-born Morris Myer, who was succeeded on his death in 1943 by his son Harry. There were also from time to time Yiddish newspapers in Manchester, [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]] and Leeds.

=== Canada ===
[[Montreal]] had, and to some extent still has, one of the most thriving Yiddish communities in North America. Yiddish was Montreal's third language (after French and English) for the entire first half of the twentieth century. ''Der [[Keneder Adler]]'' ("The Canadian Eagle", founded by [[Hirsch Wolofsky]]), Montreal’s daily Yiddish newspaper, appeared from 1907 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;CHRISTOPHER DEWOLF, "A peek inside Yiddish Montreal", ''Spacing Montreal'', February 23, 2008.[http://spacing.ca/montreal/2008/02/23/a-peek-inside-montreals-yiddish-universe/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monument-National]] was the center of Yiddish theater from 1896 until the construction of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts (now the [[Segal Centre for Performing Arts]]), inaugurated on September 24, 1967, where the established resident theater, the [[Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre]], remains the only permanent Yiddish theatre in North America. The theatre group also tours Canada, US, Israel, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Roach, "Yiddish Theater in Montreal", ''Examiner'', May 14, 2012.[[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist#examiner.com|www.examiner.com/article/jewish-theater-montreal]]; "The emergence of Yiddish theater in Montreal", "Examiner", May 14, 2012 [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist#examiner.com|www.examiner.com/article/the-emergence-of-yiddish-theater-montreal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Yiddish has receded, it is the immediate ancestral language of Montrealers like [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Leonard Cohen]] as well as former interim city mayor [[Michael Applebaum]]. Besides Yiddish-speaking activists, it remains today the native everyday language of 15,000 Montreal Hassidim.

=== Religious communities ===
[[File:Brooklyn Posters 1.jpg|thumb|A typical poster-hung wall in Jewish [[Brooklyn]], New York]]
The major exception to the decline of spoken Yiddish can be found in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities all over the world. In some of the more closely knit such communities, Yiddish is spoken as a home and schooling language, especially in Hasidic, [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvish]], or Yeshivish communities, such as [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], and in the communities of [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], and [[New Square, New York|New Square]] in New York (over 88% of the population of Kiryas Joel is reported to speak Yiddish at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/census_data_results&amp;state_id=36&amp;place_id=39853 MLA Data Center Results: Kiryas Joel, New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016053859/http://www.mla.org/census_data_results%26state_id%3D36%26place_id%3D39853 |date=2015-10-16 }}, Modern Language Association. Retrieved 17 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also in [[New Jersey]], Yiddish is widely spoken mostly in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood Township]], but also in smaller towns with [[yeshiva]]s, such as [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], and elsewhere. Yiddish is also widely spoken in the Jewish community in [[History of the Jews in Antwerp|Antwerp]], and in Haredi communities such as the ones in [[London]], [[Manchester]], and [[Montreal]]. Yiddish is also spoken in many Haredi communities throughout Israel. Among most Ashkenazi Haredim, Hebrew is generally reserved for prayer, while Yiddish is used for religious studies, as well as a home and business language. In Israel, however, Haredim commonly speak Hebrew, with the notable exception of many Hasidic communities. However, many Haredim who use Modern Hebrew also understand Yiddish. There are some who send their children to schools in which the primary language of instruction is Yiddish. Members of anti-Zionist Haredi groups such as the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]], who view the commonplace use of Hebrew as a form of Zionism, use Yiddish almost exclusively.

Hundreds of thousands of young children around the globe have been, and are still, taught to translate the texts of the [[Torah]] into Yiddish. This process is called {{lang|yi|טײַטשן|rtl=yes}} (''taytshn'') – "translating". Most Ashkenazi yeshivas' highest level lectures in Talmud and [[Halakha]] are delivered in Yiddish by the [[rosh yeshiva]]s as well as ethical talks of the [[Musar movement]]. Hasidic [[rebbe]]s generally use only Yiddish to converse with their followers and to deliver their various Torah talks, classes, and lectures. The linguistic style and vocabulary of Yiddish have influenced the manner in which many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who attend yeshivas speak English. This usage is distinctive enough that it has been dubbed "[[Yeshivish]]".

While Hebrew remains the exclusive language of [[Jewish prayer]], the Hasidim have mixed some Yiddish into their Hebrew, and are also responsible for a significant secondary religious literature written in Yiddish. For example, the tales about the [[Baal Shem Tov]] were written largely in Yiddish. The Torah Talks of the late Chabad leaders are published in their original form, Yiddish. In addition, some prayers, such as "[[God of Abraham]]", were composed and are recited in Yiddish.

There are various Universities worldwide which now offer Yiddish programs based on the [[YIVO]] Yiddish standard. Many of these programs are held during the summer and are attended by Yiddish enthusiasts from around the world. One such school located within [[Vilnius University]] (Vilnius Yiddish Institute) was the first Yiddish center of higher learning to be established in post-Holocaust Eastern Europe. Vilnius Yiddish Institute is an integral part of the four-century-old Vilnius University. Published Yiddish scholar and researcher Dovid Katz is among the Faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neosymmetria (www.neosymmetria.com) |url=http://www.judaicvilnius.com/en |title=Vilnius Yiddish Institute |publisher=Judaicvilnius.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Translate]] includes Yiddish as one of its languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowensohn |first=Josh |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-10322250-248.html |title=Oy!

Hebrew alphabet keyboards are available and right-to-left writing recognised. [[Google search]] accepts queries in Yiddish.

Over ten thousand Yiddish texts, estimated as over half of all the published works in Yiddish, are now online based on the work of the [[Yiddish Book Center]], volunteers, and the Internet Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yiddish Book Center's Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library |url=https://archive.org/details/nationalyiddishbookcenter |publisher=Internet Archives |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many websites on the Internet are in Yiddish. In January 2013, ''The Forward'' announced the launch of the new daily version of their newspaper's website, which has been active since 1999 as an online weekly, supplied with radio and video programs, a literary section for fiction writers and a special blog written in local contemporary Hasidic dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yiddish Forverts Seeks New Audience Online |url=http://forward.com/articles/169919/yiddish-forverts-seeks-new-audience-online/ |accessdate=10 January 2014 |newspaper=Forward |date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientist [[Raphael Finkel]] maintains a hub of Yiddish-language resources, including a searchable [[dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Finkel |first1=Raphael |title=Yiddish Dictionary Lookup|url=http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/dictionary.cgi |website=cs.uky.edu |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spell checker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Finkel |first1=Raphael |title=spellcheck |url=http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/checkSpellUTF.cgi |website=cs.uky.edu |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Burmese puppetry.jpg|thumb|''Yoke thé'' and puppet master]]

'''Yoke thé''' ({{MYname|MY=ရုပ်သေး|MLCTS=rupse:}}, {{IPA-my|joʊʔ θé|IPA}}, literally "miniatures") is the Burmese name for [[marionette]] puppetry. Although the term can be used for marionettery in general, its usage usually refers to the local form of string puppetry. Like most of Burmese refined art, ''yoke thé'' performances originated from royal patronage and were gradually adapted for the wider populace. ''Yoke thé'' are almost always performed in operas.

Burmese marionettes are very intricate and dexterous as they employ 18 or 19 wires for male and female characters respectively, and each puppet is controlled by only one puppeteer.

==History==
The probable date of the origin of Burmese marionettes is given as around 1780 during the reign of [[Singu Min]], and their introduction is credited to the Minister of Royal Entertainment, U Thaw. From their inception, marionettes grew in popularity in the courts of the Konbaung dynasty. Little has changed since the creation of the art by U Thaw, and the set of characters developed by him is in use today. Until the conquest of [[Upper Burma]] by the British in late 1885 during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]], ''yoke thé'' troupes thrived under royal patronage.

==List of characters==

==Music==
A traditional Burmese orchestra known as a ''[[hsaing waing]]'' usually provides the music. The puppeteers themselves often provide the voices of the characters.

==Political role==
The Burmese court was concerned with preserving the dignity of its members, and marionettes were often used to preserve the esteem of persons who had erred. The king could reprimand his children or his wife in this way by asking the puppeteers to put on a parable warning errant children or careless wives about their reckless ways. While the reprimand would be obvious to anyone who was in the know, it would largely pass unheeded by the people looking on, something that had a great deal of value in a court that could, and did, contain hundreds of people.

Burmese marionettes also served as a conduit between the ruler and his subjects. Many times, people would ask the puppeteers to mention in a veiled fashion a current event or warning to the ruler. Thus, information or popular discontent could be transferred on without any disrespect, as marionettes could say things that a human could be punished for with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Marionettes|url=http://www.puppetsnow.com/marionettes.html|publisher=Puppetsnow.com|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
''Yoke thé'' troupes, like most artisans in pre-colonial Burma alongside the Sangha, enjoyed great royal patronage. However, like most forms of traditional artwork, the support dried up upon the colonisation of Upper Burma by the British in November 1885 following the Third Anglo-Burmese War.

==Revival==
In the late 1990s, General [[Khin Nyunt]] of the ruling junta lent official support to marionette actors and troupes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monique Skidmore|title=Burma at the Turn of the 21st Century|location=Honolulu, Hi.|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawaiʻi Press]]|year=2005|page=242|isbn=978-0-8248-2857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviving a rapidly dying tradition. Nowadays, marionettes are very common in tourist attractions and also amongst the populace, and they have resumed their role of relatively safe political satire reflecting popular discontent.

A new genre of ''yoke thé'' is emerging where a character and a real life actor perform the same feat, usually with the ''yoke thé'' puppets able to mimic and sometimes out-perform their human counterparts.
